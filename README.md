The Hundred Thousands
=====================

This repository has been created to hold the results of a proposed long-running experiment on the holdings of the [Open UK Web Archive](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/).  The idea is to generate a random sample of each year of the archive's activity, and then to look back and record what has happened to those URLs since then.


Step 1. Random Sampling
-----------------------

All of our content is indexing in Apache Solr, so we can use that to generate random samples of content for each crawl year. The largest sample contains one hundred thousand archived URLs, hence the name of this repository.

Step 2. Checking Current Status Of The Samples
----------------------------------------------

Then, periodically, for each sample, we revisit those links and attempt to determine what has happened to them.

Those results are also added to this repository.

Step 3. Publish The Overall Status
----------------------------------

The results from the hundred thousand are then turned into an appropriate graph, and made available
