Fe’i comisiynwyd gan \nArolygiaeth Ei Mawrhydi dros Addysg a Hyfforddiant yng Nghymru.   \n \nDiben arolygu yw nodi nodweddion da a diffygion er mwyn i ddarparwyr allu gwella \nansawdd yr addysg a gynigir a helpu plant i gyflawni eu llawn botensial.  Diben arall \nyw hysbysu rhieni a’r cyhoedd am ansawdd addysg feithrin.  Rhaid rhoi copi o’r \nadroddiad arolygu i bob rhiant/gofalwr sydd â phlentyn yn y feithrinfa a dylai fod ar \ngael ar gais i bobl eraill.   \n \nMae arolygwyr wedi defnyddio graddfa pum pwynt i gofnodi’r holl farnau.

Nid yw’r ardal yn cael ei hystyried yn ffyniannus nac o dan \nanfantais economaidd. \n \nMae’r lleoliad  yn cael ei redeg gan bwyllgor gwirfoddol ac mae’n ddarparwr addysg \nfel aelod o Bartneriaeth Datblygiad y Blynyddoedd Cynnar a Gofal Plant, Ynys Môn. \nMae hefyd wedi cofrestru aelodaeth gyda Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin.  \n \nDarperir ar gyfer plant dwy a hanner i bedair oed, ond adeg yr arolygiad, cyfanswm o \nchwech o blant dwy a hanner a thair oed oedd ar y gofrestr. Mae pedwar o’r rhai tair \noed yn  hawlio darpariaeth wedi ei ariannu. \n \nMae’r lleoliad yn darparu ar gyfer plant ag anghenion dysgu ychwanegol ac yn ystod \nyr arolygiad roedd un plentyn felly ar y gofrestr. \n \nCymraeg yw iaith yr aelwyd i tua hanner y plant ac mae eu cefndiroedd \ncymdeithasol-economaidd yn amrywio. Adeg yr arolygiad nid oedd yr un plentyn o \ngefndir lleiafrifol ethnig yn mynychu’r lleoliad. \n \nDefnyddir prif ystafell y Neuadd ar gyfer gweithgareddau ac mae yna gegin a \nthoiledau ar wahân. Caiff y Neuadd ei defnyddio gan eraill ac o ganlyniad rhaid ei \ngosod a’i chlirio’n ddyddiol.  Does dim lle chwarae allanol ar y safle. \n \nCaiff y lleoliad ei staffio gan ddau aelod o staff, sydd yn rhannu’r cyfrifoldebau rheoli, \nynghyd ag un aelod arall rhan amser. Mae un o’r arweinyddion wedi cwblhau cwrs \nsydd yn arwain at gymhwyster Lefel 3  mewn Gofal Plant ac Addysg yn y \nBlynyddoedd Cynnar. Mae’r staff i gyd yn rhugl yn y Gymraeg.  \n \nCafodd y lleoliad ei arolygu gan Arolygiaeth Gofal a Gwasanaethau Cymdeithasol \nCymru ym mis Gorffennaf 2007. Ni chyflwynwyd tystiolaeth fod y lleoliad wedi ei \narolygu yn flanorol gan Estyn. \n  \nCynhaliwyd yr arolygiad ar foreau’r 2ail a’r  3ydd o Hydref 2007. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n  \n2.0 Prif ganfyddiadau’r adroddiad \n \n2.1  Ansawdd a safonau cyffredinol darpariaeth addysgol a ph’un a yw’r \nddarpariaeth yn hyrwyddo’r nodau ar gyfer dysgu plant yn llwyddiannus ai \npeidio  \n \nMae ansawdd a safonau’r ddarpariaeth addysgol, o’u hystyried yn gyffredinol, yn \nbriodol ac yn hyrwyddo’r canlyniadau dymunol ar gyfer dysgu plant yn llwyddiannus. \n \n \n2.2 Safonau a gyflawnir gan blant yn y chwe maes dysgu \n \nChwe maes dysgu Gradd ar gyfer plant  \no dan bump oed \nMedrau iaith, llythrennedd a chyfathrebu 2 \n \nDatblygiad personol a chymdeithasol 2 \n \nDatblygiad mathemategol 2 \n \nGwybodaeth a dealltwriaeth o’r byd 2 \n \n3 \nDatblygiad corfforol \n \nDatblygiad creadigol 2 \n \n \n2.3  Barn arolygu ar ansawdd yr addysg a ddarperir gan y lleoliad \n \nAnsawdd yr addysg Gradd ar gyfer plant  \no dan bump oed \nAnsawdd y ddarpariaeth ar gyfer datblygiad 2 \nysbrydol, moesol, cymdeithasol a diwylliannol \nplant  \nAnsawdd y cynllunio ar gyfer dysgu plant 3 \nAnsawdd yr addysgu 2 \nAnsawdd asesu a chofnodi cynnydd plant, ac 2 \nadroddiadau ar gyfer rhieni a gofalwyr \nAnsawdd y berthynas gyda rhieni, gofalwyr a’r 2 \ngymuned \nY cyfraniad a wneir gan y lleoliad i les plant 2 \nAnsawdd arweinyddiaeth a rheolaeth y lleoliad  2 \nY cynnydd a wnaed gan y lleoliad wrth weithredu’r --- \nmaterion allweddol ar gyfer gweithredu a nodwyd \nyn yr adroddiad arolygu diwethaf \n \n \n \n4\n  \n3.0 Y safonau a gyflawnir gan blant yn y chwe maes dysgu \n \nSafonau a gyflawnir gan blant 3-4 oed  \n \n3.1   Medrau iaith, llythrennedd a chyfathrebu \n \n \nNodweddion da \nMae’r plant yn arddangos medrau da wrth wrando ar oedolion ac ar ei gilydd, ac fe \ngânt gryn bleser a mwynhad wrth wrando ar amrywiaeth o storïau yn ymwneud â Sali \nMali, Smot a Bitw.

Mae eu hymwybyddiaeth o \nlythrennau’r wyddor yn datblygu’n dda ac fe ddônt i adnabod eu henwau trwy \nweithgareddau megis dewis eu matiau byrbrydau. Mae sgiliau sylfaenol ysgrifennu’r \nplant yn datblygu’n briodol  wrth iddynt ymwneud â gwahanol weithgareddau gyda \nchreonau a phensiliau yn ogystal â marcio mewn tywod, blawd, cous cous ac ewyn \neillio. \n \nDiffygion \nDoes dim diffygion yn aros allan. \n \n \n3.2 Datblygiad personol a chymdeithasol \n \n \nNodweddion da \nMae’r plant yn ymgartrefu’n gyflym ac yn ffurfio perthynas dda gydag oedolion, gan \ngynnwys ymwelwyr.  Maent yn dangos gallu cynyddol i gyd-chwarae’n hapus a \nllwyddant i gyfathrebu a chymdeithasu’n dda gyda’i gilydd.  Dangosant i gyd \neiddgarwch yn yr hyn a wnânt,  parodrwydd i helpu ei gilydd  a chymryd eu tro wrth \nsgwrsio neu chwarae gêm. Dechreuant ddatblygu strategaethau dysgu annibynnol \nda ac maent yn ymateb yn gadarnhaol i brofiadau newydd. Medrant ganolbwyntio a \ndyfalbarhau nes iddynt gwblhau’r dasg ac fe welwyd lefelau  ymddygiad  oedd yn \ngyson dda.  Maent yn dechrau bod yn gyfrifol am lendid personol a dônt maes o law i \nfedru gwisgo’n annibynnol. Dangosant barch a chonsyrn am bethau byw fel Twm, eu \npysgodyn aur ac fe wyddant ei fod yn ddibynnol arnynt am fwyd. \n \nDiffygion \nDoes dim diffygion arwyddocaol. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n 3.3 Datblygiad mathemategol \n \n \nNodweddion da  \nMae’r plant yn mwynhau rhigymau rhif a gemau cyfrif syml. Gallant ddidoli, cyfateb a \nchyfrif gwrthrychau cyfarwydd ac adnabod rhifau syml. Dônt i fedru creu a dilyn \npatrymau syml yn ôl eu lliw, siâp a maint. Maent yn adnabod nodweddion sy’n \ngysylltiedig ag ystod o siapiau dau-ddimensiwn, ynghyd â rhai tri-dimensiwn. Mae \nganddynt ddealltwriaeth ddatblygol dda o eirfa fathemategol fel mwy/llai; tal/byr a \nllawn/gwag, trwy weithgareddau ymarferol, ystyrlon. Dangosant allu cynyddol yn eu \ndealltwriaeth o fathemateg arian. \n \nDiffygion \nDoes dim diffygion arwyddocaol. \n \n \n3.4  Gwybodaeth a dealltwriaeth o’r byd  \n \n \nNodweddion da  \nMae’r plant yn ymwybodol o waith pobl yn eu cymuned megis y postmon, nyrs ac \neraill. Maent yn dangos diddordeb yng ngwaith adeiladwyr a’r tai sydd yn cael eu \ncodi gerllaw’r lleoliad. Dangosant barodrwydd i siarad am eu cartrefi  a phwy sydd yn \nbyw ynddynt. Trafodant y tywydd yn rheolaidd ac maent yn gwybod am nodweddion \ny gwahanol dymhorau.  Yn sgil gweithgareddau fel plannu bylbiau a chynnal \nymchwiliadau syml gyda blodau a d ŵr lliw, dônt i ddeall yr hyn sydd angen arnynt i \nffynnu. Datblygant sgiliau ymchwilio sylfaenol wrth arbrofi gyda chwyddwydrau a \nchynnal arbrofion gyda bal ŵn. Gyda chymorth, dônt i fedru rhaglennu’r  ‘Bee Bot’ yn \nôl y cyfarwyddiadau a roddir iddynt. Maent yn dechrau deall y cysyniad o amser trwy \ngysylltu cyfnodau o’r dydd gyda digwyddiadau penodol megis amser byrbrydau yn y \nlleoliad. Mae ganddynt ymwybyddiaeth ddatblygol  o lefydd ar draws y byd, o  \nwahanol fathau o fwydydd ac o lle y dônt. Gwyddant hefyd am wahanol ffyrdd o \ndeithio. \n \nDiffygion \nDoes dim diffygion arwyddocaol. \n \n \n3.5   Datblygiad corfforol \n \n \nNodweddion da \nMae gan y plant ddealltwriaeth dda o dwf eu hunain.

It will set out the legislation that will be presented for approval by the National Assembly for Wales in the coming years. Not all the actions that are taken by the Welsh Labour Government require new legislation but the programme to be announced today will reflect the values of Welsh Labour, and the promises made in the manifesto voted upon in the elections of May 2011.\n\nDelivering on a programme of legislation will form an important strand of work for the Welsh Labour Government. It also reflects the new era of the National Assembly which follows on from the powers referendum held in March 2011.\n \n                Read more...\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCabinet Announcement\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t    First Minister Carwyn Jones has announced the members of his new Cabinet as the Welsh Government begins its ambitious programme to stand up for Wales and create a country of equality, opportunity and social justice. \n                \nRead more...\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n        « previous | Page 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n of 9 | next »\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n      \n    \n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tParatoi ar gyfer cynhadledd y plaid lafur\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t    \n\nGyda'r gwyliau Awst allan o'r ffordd y mae ein meddyliau yn troi at y Cynhadledd y Blaid Lafur.

So she runs to her oldest friend Janet Byfield, who seems to have everything Wendy lacks: a handsome husband, a lovely little daughter, Rosie, and a beautiful home in the Cathedral Close of Rosington. David Byfield is on the verge of promotion, and Janet is the perfect wife for an ambitious young clergyman.\n\nBut perfection has always been dangerous, and gradually the idyll sours. Old sins come to haunt the present and breed new sins in their place. The shadow of death seeps through the Close, and with it comes a double mystery stretching back to turn-of-the-century Rosington, to a doomed poet-priest called Francis Youlgreave.\n\nOnly Wendy, the outsider looking in, glimpses the truth. But can she grasp its dark and twisted logic in time to prevent the coming tragedy?\n\n\"Consistently good...\" Donna Leon, Sunday Times\n\n\"...this highly sinister piece of work\" Times Literary Supplement\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t© 2010 Andrew Taylor\n\n\t\n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

We aim to deal with most complaints at stage one, but if you remain unhappy with the first response we provide, you may take your complaint to the second or third stage.\n\nSome complaints, such as allegations of fraud or corruption or relating to the propriety or standard of behaviour of the Mayor or members of the Assembly, are subject to specific procedures. Where your complaint falls into one of these categories you will be advised of the process for dealing with it.\n\nStage one\n\nThe first stage is to contact the member of staff connected with the matter you wish to complain about or their manager. Once you have outlined the problem, we will:\n\n\tTry to deal with the complaint on the spot where it is straightforward and easily resolved. We will also ensure that we investigate what led to the complaint to see whether there are any actions we can take to avoid a similar problem arising again.\n\tFor more complex complaints, we will carry out a thorough investigation and where we have made a mistake, we will try to put it right. We will advise you of any conclusion that will be used to improve our service.\n\tAcknowledge receipt of a complaint either by email or in writing within five working days advising you who is dealing with the complaint. A full written reply will be sent within 20 working days.\n\tWhere we have to seek further information on a complaint we will advise you when a response can be expected, if for any reason the complaint can not be addressed within the given time period.\n\tWhere the complaint is about something outside our control, we will advise how the issue can best be taken up and with whom if we can.\n\n\nStage two\n\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received, you can go to the next stage of this complaints procedure and refer your complaint to the relevant Director. In order to ensure that your complaint is now dealt with at stage two please clearly mark it as ‘stage two complaint’. Your complaint will then be investigated by the Director or a senior manager.

The weather finally let up and COMUNE snow contributors were eager to take advantage of the conditions. The insane amount of snowfall provided unique snow features never formed before. The crew found a natural quarter pipe/hip feature as well as a few other little jibs right off the side of the road. After a few hours of digging they created a small skate park like zone for everyone to ride. A spring session wouldnt be complete without grilling up some hot dogs and consuming copious amounts of cold beer. All the homies came out and everyone rode all day until the sun went down.

He now leads the 82 strong fleet by four points. \"I had decent speed and reasonable tactics but didn't win the races by far,\" explained the young Briton, who is ranked second in the world. \"The hardest thing is defending your lead when it is so gusty and so shifty. You take a few knocks, but you just have to be patient and take the lifts when you can.\" Poland's Piotr Myszak is second overall.\n\n\n\nHong Kong's Lee Lai Shan retains her lead in the women's event from France's Lise Vidal, even though the 1996 Olympic gold medallist failed to win a race today. \"I didn't catch the shifts as it was so squally,\" she explained, after scoring 8,2,6. \"Twice I went to the wrong side of the course and had to catch up. The course was so small that when you are behind it is difficult to catch up.\"\n\nLee Lai's advantage is now just four points after Vidal scored 4,4,2. \"It'll be tight with the French girl and it will be a tough event,\" she added. The top of this fleet is dominated by three nations with three French, three Polish and two Chinese windsurfers in the top ten.\n\n\n\nIt all came good for Finland's Sari Multala in the Europe fleet. The world champion made up for some costly errors in yesterday's opening three races and was always within the top three at the windward mark to pull through on the downwind legs and win all three races.\n\n\"I liked the conditions today but yesterday I had a few problems like a capsize, so I wasn't slow, it just wasn't my day,\" she reflected. Carolijn Brouwer from the Netherlands is three points behind after six races.\n\n\n\nA third and a first place from Britain's Paul Goodison puts him back in charge of the Laser fleet with a two point lead over France's Xavier Leclair. Goodison was on course to win the first race but capsized on the downwind leg. He caught up to second, only to capsize again. After a herculian effort he fought back to take third place on the line.\n\nGoodison is now able to discard his premature start from yesterday to lead the event, but Leclair maintained the pressure with first and second positions in series races four and five.\n\n\n\nAfter several Tornado's limped back to the dock yesterday with broken parts and the occasional missing rig, they were wisely kept ashore with the delicate Star and 49er fleets. The safety boats meant for the Finn course were kept busy on the joint Laser and Europe race area so the Finn fleet also enjoyed a day off.\n\n\n\nBut the Ynglings were sent out just after midday to an inshore course for two races and German crews now hold first and second overall. Ulrike Schümann, Wibke Bulle and Winnie Lippert lead the series after four races with a 1,6,3,1 scoreline. This gives them an eight point lead over teammates Kristin Wagner, Aaan Hoell and Veronika Lochbrunner.\n\n\n\nSeveral 470s also returned the dock with damaged kit or broken masts after gusts ripped through their course after the first race. Former Europe Olympic silver medal winner Margriet Matthjsse from the Netherlands, now sailing with Lisa Wersterhof in the women's doublehanded class, was seen being towed in minus a rig.\n\n\n\nThe 77 boat men's fleet is divided into two with 1996 Olympic gold medallists Eugeny Braslavets and Igor Matvienko from the Ukraine winning their heat, before the a majority of the fleet was laid flat by a squall. \"When the storm came over it was just crazy,\" explained helmsman Eugeny, who later put their race win down to perseverence. \"Positions were changing all the time. At the beginning we weren't doing too well. Then we gained some places, then lost some and had to fight the whole time.\"\n\nThe second group race was won by Sergey Bartashevich and Egor Petrovich. Braslavets and and Matvienko held the overall lead before the fleet were sent back out late this afternoon for another two possible races.\n\n\n\nThe first women's race was won by Australian Olympic gold medallists Jenny Armstrong and Belinda Powell. They were second overall to Russia's Vlada Dienko and Diana Knutskih prior to this afternoons racing.\n\n\n\nFinally, Germany's Paralympic gold medallist Hieko Kröger continues to dominate the 2.4mR class. He has now won three of the four races but he admitted that today's back to back victories were hard work. This is the first time the a Paralympic event has been combined with the Olympic Classes at Kiel, and this could be the start for the future.\n\n\n\n\"Another German led around the course for one lap in the first race before I took over but in the second race Jens Als Anderson (Danish Paralmpic silver medallist) led for most of the way. It was difficult to beat him as we have the same speed and he is a good tactican,\" explained Kröger.\n\nAll results are strictly provisional and subject to later change.\n\n\n\nKieler Woche is supported by Volvo and boot-Düsseldorf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKieler Woche Media/ISAF Secretariat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tE-mail this page\n\tPrint this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tContact ISAF\tWomen's Sailing\tMarketing & Media\tHall of Fame\tWorld Sailor\tOffshore\tDisabled Sailing\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tOlympic Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t2010 Youth Olympic Games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMember Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tConnect to Sailing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t© Copyright ISAF/ISAF UK LTD.

October 2010\n  Lock Stock Welsh Alliance\n\n    \n\n\n    Bamouth & Dyffryn Utd 3\n\n    \n\n\n    Llanrug United 4\n\n\n    LLANRUG United gained sweet revenge at the Wern Mynach last Saturday when they inflicted a third successive home defeat of the campaign on Barmouth.\n\n    An injury time goal from striker Matthew Phillips gave the visitors all three points in a very entertaining encounter, while Barmouth had clinched victory over their opponents in similar fashion seven days earlier with an identical scoreline.\n\n    Llanrug’s win, however, was a bitter pill to swallow for the Magpies, who had recovered from a 3-1 deficit to claw themselves back into this match at 3-3, with only 10 minutes remaining.\n\n    They were made to pay for a poor first half defensive performance that gifted their opponents the advantage, and perhaps the visitors deservedly took the points at the end as Llanrug felt the lead could have been more.\n\n    More worrying for the home side is the amount of goals they are now leaking, and this is not helped by Barmouth manager Iolo Owen having to field an unsettled side every week.\n\n    The next couple of months will prove whether the Magpies are up to the task of keeping their status at this level as they face tricky away matches in the league against the front runners.\n\n    Last weekend, the early exchanges were pretty even, with Barmouth’s Ceri Roberts first to show when he was denied by visiting keeper Aled Williams.\n\n    Then on seven minutes, Llanrug took the lead in simple fashion, with Ceirion Williams tapping into an empty net with the home defence looking all at sea.\n\n    Shane Jones then had an effort tipped onto the post as Barmouth came close to levelling matters, and Llanrug’s Gethin Phillips had a shot that flashed across the Barmouth goal.\n\n    Paul Lewis was next to have a shot blocked midway through the first half and with half-time looming, the home side did draw level when Shane Jones side-footed into the net from five yards after good work down the left by Guy Roberts.\n\n    With the play sweeping from end to end, there was still time for Phillips to have another effort for Llanrug when blazing over, and Geraint Owen fired wide of the upright for the hosts.\n\n    Then, on the stroke of half time the match produced another school book error to allow Williams to score his and Llanrug’s second and restore the visitors’ lead.\n\n    Matters got worse on 50 minutes when David Noel Williams made it 3-1 to Llanrug and the hosts were hanging on at this stage from even further behind.\n\n    Guy Roberts then hit the post for Barmouth on 65 minutes as the hosts began to rally and on 75 minutes, substitute Matthew Hughes headed home from an excellent cross by Mike Irvine to reduce the deficit.\n\n    Then on 80 minutes, Shane Jones dramatically levelled the match again, with a bullet header from a long Craig Papirnyk free kick.\n\n    Steven Jones then went agonisingly close for Barmouth on 85 minutes, before Carl Griffiths was denied by home keeper Darren Andrews in a one on one situation a minute later.\n\n    Then, as both sides looked all set to settle for a point, the visitors broke the offside trap to allow Matthew Phillips the simplest of tap-ins despite the best efforts of home keeper Andrews.\n\n\n    Pictured: Barmouth’s Paul Lewis taunts the Llanrug

Mae’r streiciau hyn yn fygythiad i\nddiogelwch y cyhoedd, yn enwedig yn awr a ninnau’n wynebu’r posibilrwydd o wrthdaro\nmilwrol yn Irac a mwy o fygythiad o derfysgaeth yma yn y DU.\nOs caiff streiciau pellach eu galw, bydd y lluoedd arfog yn darparu gwasanaeth tân argyfwng\nunwaith yn rhagor. Yn fras, mae’r un nifer o bersonél milwrol yn cael eu neilltuo i ddarparu\ngwasanaeth argyfwng yn awr ag yr oedd adeg y streic gyntaf. Fodd bynnag, rhaid pwysleisio\nna all y lluoedd milwrol gynnig yr un gallu ymladd tanau â’r hyn a ddarperir gan y\ngwasanaeth tân, ond byddant yn ceisio lleihau’r perygl i fywyd dynol yn ystod streiciau, cyn\nbelled ag y mae hynny’n bosibl. Diogelwch y cyhoedd yw’r flaenoriaeth. Bydd y lluoedd\nmilwrol yn ceisio achub bywydau a sicrhau bod gwasanaethau hanfodol yn cael eu cynnal.\nPe bai digwyddiad mawr yn ystod streic gan y gwasanaeth tân, byddai’r lluoedd milwrol yn\ngwneud cymaint ag a fedrent, ond ni allent ddarparu’r ymateb a ddisgwyliwn gan y\ngwasanaeth tân. Lluniwyd cytundeb gan bob ochr, ar 22 Tachwedd, y byddai dynion tân ar\nstreic yn ymateb i ddigwyddiadau terfysgol neu ddigwyddiadau sifil eraill mawr. Mae\ntrefniadau wedi’u sefydlu hefyd i alw am gymorth wrth gefn oddi wrth frigadau cyfagos pe\nbai galw am weithgaredd cyson dros gyfnod o amser.\nBydd y lluoedd milwrol yn darparu gallu cyfyngedig i ddelio â digwyddiadau o’r math y\ncyfeiriwch atynt, gyda chymorth oddi wrth asiantaethau priodol eraill fel yr awdurdodau lleol\nac Asiantaeth yr Amgylchedd.\n",

Daniel is doing a fantastic job, so let's just deal with this movie and see how it does.\"\n\n        With the previous four instalments in the X-Men series making more than $786m (?484m) at the global box office, there can be little worries on that front.\n\n        Yet First Class does require a certain leap of faith, presenting as it does younger versions of superhero characters already closely associated with other actors.\n\n        Fassbender, for example, plays Erik Lehnsherr, a Holocaust survivor with special powers who appeared in the first three X-Men blockbusters in the villainous guise of Magneto.\n\n  \n\tContinue reading the main story\t\tX-MEN FILMS TO DATE\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t X-Men (2000), dir.

Matthew Vaughn\n\n\n\t\n\t\n      In those films the role was portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen. His successor, though, opted not to base his portrayal too closely on what went before.\n\n        \"When I got the job I thought about studying McKellen - getting my hands on everything I could of him as a young man on screen, studying his voice and physicality and what not.\n\n        \"And then I sat down with Matthew and he decided that wasn't the way he wanted to go. So I ditched that idea totally and just used the comic book material that was available.\"\n\n        British actor James McAvoy had a similar quandary. In playing the young Charles Xavier, aka Professor X, how closely should he cleave to Sir Patrick Stewart's version?\n\n        \"There was no point playing him the same way in a different suit,\" shrugs the 32-year-old star of Atonement and the first Chronicles of Narnia film.\n\n        \"It was important that we started at a different place while still taking cues from his performance.\n\n  \n  \n\n    X-Men: First Class dramatises the first meeting between 'Magneto' and 'Professor X'\n  \n\n      \"So I looked at Sir Patrick's performance and saw how to make it different. Where he was wise I would be foolhardy; where he was chaste I'd be randy.\n\n        \"By the end of three films - if we make three films - I'll end up doing something much more like Patrick Stewart.\"\n\n        As McAvoy's remarks suggest, First Class is unlikely to be the final big-screen outing for Marvel's band of occasionally fractious \"mutants\".\n\n        There is the potential, for example, for its heroes to feature in one or more of the other Marvel-based feature films currently in production.\n\n        The studio's over-arching concept is for the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk to come together as a single fighting force.\n\n        For the moment, however, the X-Men will continue to exist in their own distinct universe - one that, according to McAvoy, subtly mirrors the real world we live in.\n\n        \"One of the things that runs through all the movies is they're about people who feel like outsiders,\" he says.\n\n  \n  \n\n    Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen co-starred in the original X-Men trilogy\n  \n\n      \"They're people who don't like themselves, who are afraid of themselves, who want to be normal or who rejoice in the fact they're not normal.\"\n\n        \"Aside from the powers the characters have, they are all really human,\" reflects US actor Kevin Bacon, whose role as criminal mastermind Sebastian Shaw sees him use his fellow mutant outcasts to pursue his own villainous ends.\n\n        \"They feel things, they get jealous, they hate and fear and get drunk together.\n\n        \"That was the challenge from an acting standpoint - to forget about the powers and constantly bring it back to the human side.\n\n        \"I've also never played a billionaire playboy megalomaniac, so that was cool as well.\"\n\n        X-Men: First Class is out in the UK on 1 June.\n\n             \n\t\n\t\n\n  \n  \n \t\n\t\n\tMore on This Story\n\n\t  \n\t\n    Related Stories\n\n    \t            \n                        'Lost' McKellen footage unearthed            \n        \t\t\t\t24 MAY 2011, \n                        ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS          \n                \n\t            \n                        Take That write song for X-Men            \n        \t\t\t\t10 MAY 2011, \n                        MUSIC          \n                \n\t            \n                        X-Men prequel set for 'next year'            \n        \t\t\t\t05 MAY 2010, \n                        ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS          \n                \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t \n\n\t        \n\n\tRelated Internet links\n\n\t\t\n\t            X-Men: First Class\n\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\n        The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites\n\n\t\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n      \n  \n\t\n  Share this page\n\n  \t\n      Delicious\n    \n\t\n      Digg\n    \n\t\n      Facebook\n    \n\t\n      reddit\n    \n\t\n      StumbleUpon\n    \n\t\n      Twitter\n    \n\t\n      Email\n    \n\t\n      Print\n    \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n    \n        \t\n  \t\n              \n            \n\n\n\tMore Entertainment & Arts stories\n\n        RSS\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tViolent film ad is banned from TV\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAn advert for a film which featured a man's head exploding and was broadcast during teen show Glee is banned by the advertising watchdog.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGeordie Shore is 'good for city'\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRare Michelangelo to go on sale\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t     \n\t       \t         \n\t       \t         \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTop Stories\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t'Shocking' care abuse condemned\n\t\n\t\n\tFA fails to delay Fifa election\n\t\n\t\n\tNet-connected devices set to boom\n\t\n\t\n\tE. coli: Cases rising in Germany\n\t\n\t\n\tCourt seeks speedier Mladic trial\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\n      \t\n\n\t       \t         \n\t       \t         \n\n\t\n\n\t\t\tFeatures & Analysis\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Google cheats\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCan you make a pub quiz smartphone-proof?

It will encourage the use of a unique UK asset, the National Health Service, to help drive the process of innovation. It is this type of strategic investment that will give this country the edge it will need to compete in tomorrow's global economy,\" commented Lord Drayson.\n\nIn sickness and in health\n\nMeet some of our Role Models working in healthcare.\n \nYou’ve read it.

Dmitri Shostakovich���s Viola Sonata is his last work which received its premiere on October 1, 1975, after the composer���s death. As is the case with other works of Shostakovich, quotations from his earlier compositions as well as allusions and quotations from works by other composers play an important role in the Viola Sonata. The significance of these quotations is highlighted in one of the composer���s letters written around the time of the Sonata���s composition: ���By building bridges into the future we must take care not to burn the bridges connecting today���s culture to its immortal past���.\n\nIn contrast with the often introspective and brooding music of Shostakovich, Nikolai Kapustin���s oeuvre is brimming with optimism and humour and boasts a unique style based on the fusion of jazz and classical methods of composition. Kapustin���s music is still relatively unknown, but is quickly gathering a faithful following of fans in Europe, USA and Japan. Anna Smith and Tanya Ursova gave a UK premiere of Kapustin���s jazz-infused Viola Sonata in 2006 and are delighted to be bringing this vibrant work to a wider audience.  \t\t\n\n\n  \t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tEventList powered by schlu.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t    \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nPlease note Free London Listings and its subsidiaries are not responsible for running any events listed here.�� If you have any queries regarding the event you should contact the event organisers directly.�� Due to the number of events listed here we will not enter into correspondence regarding individual event details.�� Events who list here appreciate your feedback please leave information regarding the events in our forums.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \nAdvertisement\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \nEvents\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n \n<< ��October��11�� >>\t��S��\t��M��\t��T��\t��W��\t��T��\t��F��\t��S��\n\t��\t��\t��\t��\t��\t��\t����1\n\t����2\t����3\t����4\t����5\t����6\t����7\t����8\n\t����9\t10\t11\t12\t13\t14\t15\n\t16\t17\t18\t19\t20\t21\t22\n\t23\t24\t25\t26\t27\t28\t29\n\t30\t31\t��\t��\t��\t��\t��\n\n\n\n \n \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n    \n  Copyright �� 2009 Free London Listings\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nDesigned and built by Lucid.net\n\n\n\n\n",

It was also responsible for providing artillery trains for armies and maintaining coastal fortresses and, later, management of the artillery and engineer corps. It also produced maps for military purposes, a function later taken over by the Ordnance Survey. The board existed under various names from at least the early fifteenth century until 1855, with headquarters in the Tower of London.\n\n[edit] History\n\nThe introduction of gunpowder to Europe led to innovations in offensive weapons such as cannon and defences such as fortifications. In the 1370s, to manage the new technology, the royal household appointed a courtier to administer weapons, arsenals and castles. The office and main arsenal were located in the White Tower of the Tower of London.[1] The earliest known Master of Ordnance was Nicholas Merbury, appointed about 1415-1420 by Henry V of England. Merbury was present at the Battle of Agincourt.[2] The Office of Ordnance was created by Henry VIII of England in 1544 and became the Board of Ordnance in 1597,[3] its principal duties being to supply guns, ammunition, stores and equipment to the King's Navy.\n\nThe Board of Ordnance consisted of six principal officers:\n\n\tMaster-General of the Ordnance (head of the board)\n\tLieutenant-General of the Ordnance\n\tSurveyor-General of the Ordnance\n\tClerk of the Ordnance\n\tStorekeeper of the Ordnance\n\tClerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance\n\n\nIn 1830, the principal officers were reduced to four by the abolition of the posts of Lieutenant-General and Clerk of the Deliveries.\n\nThe Treasurer of the Ordnance was also an important officer of the department, although he did not sit on the board. This office was consolidated with several others in 1836 to form that of Paymaster-General. A number of other inferior officers reported to the board, such as clerks, storekeepers, engineers, and master gunners.\n\nIssues of performance in the Crimean War, especially disastrous lack of due provision for operations during the Russian winter of 1854[4]:p 53 brought about the Board's demise in 1855. [See also the reference to Lord Raglan below.]\n\n\nAs a result of enquiries made into the breakdown of transport and hospital arrangements during the first winter of the war, the Board of Ordnance, which had been in existence for four hundred years, was abolished, and the Artillery together with the Royal Engineers came directly under the Commander-in-Chief and the War Office like the rest of the Army.[4]:p 55\n\n\nThe former board was incorporated into the War Office by an 1855 Act of Parliament (18 & 19 Vict. c. 117) as the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance.\n\n[edit] Subdivisions of the Board of Ordnance\n\nThe Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers answered to the Board of Ordnance instead of the War Office until 1855. The Ordnance Medical Department was established to provide surgeons for these corps.\n\n[edit] Ordnance Board\n\nAlmost fifty years later, after the Second Boer War, and unease that the British Army had been ill-equipped, a new office called the Ordnance Board was created. It consists of a board of munitions experts, whose purpose was to advise the Army Council on the safety and approval of weapons. The Ordnance Board, and its name, survived within the Ministry of Defence until the mid-1990s when it was renamed the Defence Ordnance Safety Group. Long before then, the Ordnance Board had extended its scope to encompass more than just the safety and approval of the Army’s ordnance.\n\n[edit] Notable staff\n\n\tOne of its 18th century map-makers was noted water-colour artist Paul Sandby.\n\tLord Raglan, the British commander-in-chief during the Crimean War, was also the last Master-General of the Board of Ordnance.[5] It is very likely that his incompetence in the field of battle was more to blame than the Board of Ordnance for the 1854-55 supply failures. Ironically, he himself died of dysentery in the Crimea on 29 June 1855 at a time when his forces were afflicted with cholera and reeling from a disastrous series of military failures.[6]:p 302\n\n(In 1855) . . . a loud outcry against Lord Raglan had begun in the press. He was charged with neglecting to see to the actual state of his troops, and to the necessary measures for their relief. Their condition was becoming more and more pitiable; their numbers dwindling rapidly from death and disease. The road between Balaclava and the camp had become a muddy quagmire, the few remaining horses of our cavalry were rapidly disappearing, every day the difficulty of getting up food and other necessaries from Balaclava was becoming more serious, and still no provision was being made for supplying an effective means of transport.[6]:p 181\n\n\n\n\n\n[edit] See also\n\n\tList of Masters-General from 1415\n\tRoyal Ordnance Factories\n\tOrdnance Survey\n\tBroad arrow\n\tAnthony Roll\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n\t^ Royal Engineers Museum - The Corps, Ordnance and its Train (1370-1713) - Part 2\n\t^ Part 01 - Arms of the Board of Ordnance\n\t^ Board of Ordnance (Britain) on Flags of the World website\n\t^ a b Graham C A L DSO psc, Brig Gen The Story of the Royal Regiment of Artillery RA Institution, Woolwich 1939\n\t^ Abolition of the Board of Ordnance,1855 On website of Royal Engineers Museum\n\t^ a b Martin T The Life of His Royal Highness the Prince Consort Smith Elder & Co, London (1877) Vol III p 180 (Online version transcribed from copy in the University of California)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis text was last fetched from this Wikipedia page (where you can edit it) on\n\n\t\t16 Nov 2011, 6:11am under the terms of the GFDL.\n\n\t\t\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnnotations\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Pauline on Mon  4 Jul 2005, 09:21am.

It consisted of a Master (the equivalent of the Navy Tresurer) and a board of officers similar to the Principal Officers of the Navy and similarly charged with the duty of mutual supervision—the Lieutenant Surveyor, Clerk Storekeeper, Clerk of deliveries and (after 1670) Treasurer.  In 1664-70 and 1679-82 their work was performed by commissioners. The offices and principal storehouses were in the Tower where many of the officers had official lodgings.  By this time much of the ‘materiel’ was manufactured elsewhere than the Tower, in gunpowder facyories and gun foundaries. \n\n\nIn common with other departments in the late 17th century—such as the Treasury and Pepys’s Navy Office and Admiralty—the Ordnance was to a significent extent, though not completely, reformed under the pressure of increased business.  It gew in size—from 9 clerks in 1660 to 38 in 1703, and from 175 technical officers in 1675 to around 450 under Anne—and at the same time improved efficiency.  Pepys greatly admired its methods.  The Commissioners of 1664-70 began a process whereby contractors were paid ‘in course’, salaries were substituted for fees and life-tenures were abolished.  From 1667 the office assumed responsibility for all fortifications in the kingdom.  The Instuctions of 1683 issued by Lord Dartmouth, the Master, codified new and old practices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost an annotation\n\n\n            \n\n\n\nBefore posting an annotation please read the annotation guidelines.\n\nIf your comment isn't directly relevant to this page, try the discussion group for other Pepys-related topics or the social group for general chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour name: (required)\n\n\n\n\nEmail address: (required)\n\n\n\n\nYour URL: (optional)\n\n\n\n\nRemember your info?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnnotation:\n\n\nNo HTML in annotations.

And it won't simply be a case of those who obtain the lowest grades being excluded either - depending on the choice of university and subject, many of those rejected could actually possess better grades than many of those accepted.\n\nIt raises big questions about how many places should be provided at universities, and how they should be filled.\n\nIt seems to me that there are two fairly rational ways of determining how many places should be provided in total.  The first is to look at the number of people who want to have a university education, and who meet the minimum requirements; the second is to look at the number of jobs requiring graduates, and only provide enough places to meet that demand.  We are actually doing neither of those things; we are setting the number of places based primarily on the cost of providing them.\n\nI make no secret of the fact that I favour the approach of providing the education for all those who want it and meet the minimum requirements.  A better educated population has advantages well beyond the merely economic.\n\nBut I also think we need to get away from the idea that there are 'graduate jobs' and 'non-graduate jobs'.  Of course there are some jobs where a particular degree qualification is an absolute requirement – medicine is the one which immediately springs to mind.  But in many cases, employers restricting their openings to graduates are doing so unnecessarily.  It's sometimes little more than a lazy way of sifting and grading people.\n\nAs a concrete example, I remember having a bit of a battle with HR professionals many years ago when I wanted to recruit non-graduates as computer programmers.  We were having difficulty getting the numbers we needed, and I just didn't see that a degree was as relevant as having the basic aptitude and ability.  I won the battle, and the people I went on to recruit turned out to be, on the whole, just as effective as the graduates.\n\nMany graduates themselves are already having to recognise that if they want to restrict themselves to jobs labelled as being for graduates, then they are restricting their career chances.  And many of those being rejected by universities this year will be every bit as able and competent as those accepted, but will be available for work three years earlier than their successful schoolmates.  Employers who ignore that pool of talent will be doing themselves no favours in the long term.  Judging people on their abilities and experience rather than on possession of a particular piece of paper may be harder to do; but those employers who are prepared to do it will find they have access to a wider range of talent.\n\nSetting unrealistic expectations about the opportunities available to people just because they are graduates; excluding people from consideration just because they aren't; and deciding how many graduates to turn out for financial reasons rather than based either on demand for skills or demand for places are all misguided ways of looking at the benefits of higher education both to individuals and to society as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nJohn Dixon\n\n\nat\n12:13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels:\nEducation,\nHigher Education,\nJobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Druid of Anglesey\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nAn interesting post, John. Although I completely agree with you that a well educated populace is advantageous I do wonder whether the pendulum has swung too far. The previous administration set a target of 50% of school leavers should go to university - this is I believe substantially higher than the majority of countries and it has always been unclear how they decided on the figure of 50%. The problem as I see it is (a) too many young people now go to university to take degree courses of dubious merit, while those pupils who are not academically minded don't have respected nationally recognised vocational or apprenticeship schemes like those in, say,  Germany for instance; (b) it could be argued that this over promotion of attending university is leading to depopulation of rural areas such as where you and I live. It is undoubtably true that more young people leave Anglesey to go to University than eventually return, because (a) there are few graduate jobs on Anglesey and (b) because the outside world they experience at University is more attractive to the young. These intelligent young people are, presumably, those who in earlier generations would have stayed close to where they were brought up and set up small businesses or opened shops etc - now they head to Cardiff or London instead.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n12 August 2010 14:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dixon\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI agree that the figure of 50% looks entirely arbitrary.  I suspect it's set from a budgetary perspective rather than from any consideration of demand.\n\nAnd I also agree that there is a second class status associated with more vocational qualifications which is not found elsewhere in Europe.  That 'status gap' is something which we need to address (and differential charging of fees between the two types of education, and/or a graduate tax serve only to emphasise the different values placed on the two types of education, in my view).\n\nBut I wouldn't agree that 'too many young people now go to university'; I firmly believe that if people have the ability and the desire to follow a university education, then they should have the opportunity to do so.  But, the higher the proportion of young people attending university, the more we need to 're-set' their expectations about 'graduate jobs' being available to them afterwards.\n\nI'd also agree that educating our talented young people can and does lead them to leave rural areas and seek opportunities elsewhere, but I could not for one moment support the idea that we should tell them that they can't have the education they want because we need them to stay uneducated in their own communities.  I'm sure that you weren't really suggesting that, but it is one potential consequence of the line of argument which you advance; and a consequence which I would strongly oppose.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n12 August 2010 15:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Druid of Anglesey\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nJohn, \n\nNo I am not making the argument that able and academically gifted persons shouldn't go to University. What I'm saying is that an arbitrary target of 50% has led to (a) a proliferation of unnecessary courses which offer no discernable value to the students or the country; and (b) because of the lack of a respected alternative non-academic stream, persons who would perhaps be more suited to vocational qualifications have been pushed along to universities instead. The side effects of this has been a depopulation of the countryside - and all the problems that brings now and in the future.\n\nThis country needs a two stream educational system, similar to the one in Germany, were there are equally respected academic and vocational streams of higher education which suit the needs of students and the country.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n12 August 2010 18:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaid Panteg\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI side with Druid a bit on this to be honest. \n\nWe need full and equal status between academic and vocational education. \n\nWe need to fund the most economically and socially usefully courses (in economic growth areas and in public service needs) fully, but have a well formed graduate tax (with clear upper limits and full amount cut offs).\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n13 August 2010 09:43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dixon\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI'd agree that we need a two stream approach, with equal status for both.  Perhaps if we had that, the demand for university places would drop; but perhaps not.  It leaves unanswered the question, however, of how we decide which people go into one stream and which go into the other.  If not on the basis of the choice of the individuals concerned (subject to meeting any entry requirements) then how?  Anything other than that means that some people will be denied their education of choice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n13 August 2010 09:45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dixon\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nMarcus,\n\nIf funded by  agraduate tax, are you therefore suggesting that everyone, whether they have a vocational or a university education, should pay it?  That's not what the name suggests to me.  And if only the graduates pay it, doesn't that mean that we are placing a different status on the two types of eductaion?  And if everyone pays it, regardless of which route they take, then in what sense is it other than an increase in income tax?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n13 August 2010 09:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpirit of BME\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI think Druid has some interesting things to say.\nLeaving aside vocational degrees , I sat in a large Britsh company for over 30 years and seeing the quality of the degree intake ( and these were the best of all who had applied) I can only say that about 3% that came into my department \"made it\" as they say.50% of those had worked previously in their fathers business or something.\nAs I have said before -Canary Wharf had more degrees per square meter than anywhere else and did they see the Banking crash coming - No - what a shower.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n13 August 2010 17:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dixon\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nSpirit,\n\nHaving done a certain amount of graduate recruitment myself, I am not in disagreement.  Indeed, I think I made the point in the original post that far too many employers over-value the possession of a degree and under-value other skills and abilities.  And there is a real issue as to whether all degrees have the same worth or even attain the same standard.  Those are all important points.\n\nBut the point which neither yourself nor the Druid have really answered is this: how many university places do we supply, and on what basis do we allocate the privilege of a higher education if there are more people meeting the minimum criteria than there are places available?\n\nI agree with the Druid that the current target of 50% looks entirely arbitrary.  I believe it to be based on financial considerations, rather than thinking about what society needs, or what individuals want, or how many people meet the requirements.\n\nThe result is that we are turning away people who have the ability and the desire to follow a higher education (which is where my post started), and I think that there's a danger that we waste talent, particularly if employers continue to operate on the 'degree essential' philosophy.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n13 August 2010 18:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaid Panteg\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\n\"If funded by agraduate tax, are you therefore suggesting that everyone, whether they have a vocational or a university education, should pay it? \"\n\nIt is a fair question. Personally, I would have different 'parts' to. So ability to pay would alter how much part A would cost, certain 'needed' degree areas could offer a discount in part B etc...\n\nThen the 'offer' from the university would include the full amount payable, then how that is paid back is dependant on earnings. Once that payable limit is reached, then you stop paying.\n\nVocational training is very different in terms of delivery and how you 'study' is it not? How this is paid for would need a different way. I believe that the big companies that often bemoan the standards of degree students to help fund the training they demand. \n\nThis is initial attempt off the top of my head, some deeping thinking would need to be had beyond that.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n14 August 2010 08:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Dixon\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nMarcus,\n\nBut the more you tweak the system so that the amount collected more closely reflects the education services received, the less it looks like a 'tax'.  It looks more and more like a system of charging for education where the tax system is used to collect the fees.  That in turn looks increasingly similar to the current system of collecting loan repayments through payroll deductions, just called something different.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n14 August 2010 09:19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Post\n\n\nOlder Post\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne-mail\n\n\nBorthlas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me\n\n\n\t\n\nJohn Dixon\n\n\n\tA personal view on politics from a former Plaid Cymru member, activist, candidate, and national officer, including periods as Party Chair in 1992-3 and 2002-2010.

With the growing number of deaths among workers it is a life and death issue for many union members ? as important as pay, improved working conditions and benefits. \n\nSeven projects are being implemented in Zambia, Malawi and South Africa, and were the subject of last year?s monitoring and evaluation visit. A UIDF monitoring team had the opportunity to evaluate these projects and to monitor how well the projects? objectives were being achieved.\n\nWith a budget of ?150,000, the UIDF has supported projects on HIV/AIDS in six southern African countries. Seven projects are being implemented in Zambia, Malawi and South Africa, and were the subject of last year?s monitoring and evaluation visit. A UIDF monitoring team had the opportunity to evaluate these projects and to check how well the projects? objectives were being achieved. \nIn countries like Zambia and Malawi the practice of ?cleansing? is still widespread: a tradition that forces widowed women to sleep with their husbands? brothers even when the husbands had died of AIDS. \nThe unions, as part of their education and training programme, have stimulated a debate about this practice. At the same time they have stressed the need for their members to tackle this issue through informed choices. With help from the UIDF, the funding has provided the unions with the resources to promote a more effective programme of prevention.\n\nIn Malawi, the unions are informing their members about government policy which allocates 2% of the country?s budget to support people who are living with HIV/AIDS. The unions want to lobby government to include a provision in the policy which would give additional income to members of the unions who \nMembers of ZULAWU (Zambia local government union) with UNISON NEC member Eleanor Smith (pictured above)\n\nhave HIV/AIDS, so they can afford to buy nutritional food and continue to have a level of income when they are unable to work due to illness.\n\nHOSPERSA, a health workers? union in South Africa, is developing an occupational health policy on workers who contract HIV/AIDS during the course of their duties, including the provision of proper compensation. At the same time they are developing a health and safety training programme on accident prevention and the possible contraction of HIV/AIDS at work.\n\nWhile it may appear that a lot of these projects ought to be the core work of a union, in Africa, this is work which could not have been done without the support of UNISON.\nhttp://www.unison.org.uk/uidf\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark, print, post, feed or send to a friend:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPrint version\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n    \tBack to Quick Links\n\n\n   \n\n\n\nContact\n\nUNISON International\n\nUNISON Centre, \n\n130 Euston Road, \n\nLondon NW1 2AY\n\nEmail: IRelations@unison.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCHRP's autumn event: ?Judicial System in the Philippines: The Maguindanao Massacre' \n\n\t\n\nTo be held on?23 November, 6pm at the Amnesty International Human Rights Action Centre.

Police forces need to have enough resources to be  able to deal with major incidents and my worry is that forces will be  ill-equipped to deal with large emergencies due to the major cutbacks  that are coming their way.\"\n\nMr Franks' fellow Plaid Cymru South Wales Central Assembly member,  Leanne Wood, who is a former probation officer, is also campaigning for  the powers to deal with the courts, police, prisons, probation service  and sentencing to be devolved to Wales.\n\nMs Wood believes this would allow the Welsh Assembly Government to  apply its chosen policies based on the democratic mandate of the people  of Wales.��\nBack to previous page\n\n\n\n         \n\t\t\n\n        \n\n            \n   \t\nJoin Plaid online from just ��2 a monthDonate Now!to Wales's national movementVolunteerYou can help us winPlaidLive.comYour pics, tweets & videos live on your forum!\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n                \n\n\t   \t\t\t\t\t\n\n   \t\n   \tGet Email Alerts\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are human leave this blank:\n\nName\n\n *\n\nEmail\n\n *\n\nSubmit\n��\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n            \n\n            \n                \n  \n\n       \n\tOur Vision\tBusiness, economy and transport\n\tHealth, care and social services\n\tChildren, education and young people\n\tOur culture, Heritage and language \n\tEnvironment, Rural affairs and regeneration \n\tCrime, law and order\n\tLocal government \n\tInternational Affairs\n\tOur national future \n\n\n\n\n\tWho we are\tSenedd: AMs\n\tWestminster: MPs\n\tWestminster: Lords\n\tEurope: MEP\n\tCouncillors\n\tOur History \n\tContact us\n\tNEC\n\n\n\n\n\tGet Involved\tJoin Plaid today\n\tDonate\n\tI'm Plaid!\n\tMy Plaid Poster\n\tPresidents Club\n\tSpread the Word\n\tLeaflet to win\n\tGet Social\n\tDonate my creativity\n\tLogo and branding suite\n\tMembers Section\n\tVacancies\n\tPlaid Credit Union \n\n\n\n\n\tWe're Plaid\tGreens for Plaid\n\tCymruX - Young Plaid \n\tPlaid Pride\n\tChristians for Plaid\n\tUndeb - trade unionists\n\tMuslims for Plaid\n\tInternational Nationalists\n\tEnglish for Plaid\n\tThe Councillors Association\n\n\n\n\tNews & Events\tNews\n\tEvents\n\tThe Slate blog\n\tPlaidLive.com!\n\tLeadership 2012\n\tMoving Forward: Renewing Plaid for Wales\n\n\n\n\n                     \n\n                \n\n            \t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPrivacy Policy | \nPromoted by Plaid Cymru, Ty Gwynfor, Anson Court, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff | \nLinks | \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n                \tCopyright Plaid Cymru ��� the Party of Wales.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & developed by Spindogs\n\n\n                \n\n            \n            \n\n            \n\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This should be an internal departmental mater which will not involve insurers.\n\t\tIn some cases, the circumstances in which an employee���s effects have been lost or damaged might suggest liability on the Department and in such circumstances the incident should be reported to the Government insurers under existing procedures.  In such circumstances the employee will be treated as a member of the public and the claim will be registered as a Public Liability claim.\n\n\tInsurer���s treatment of the claim will depend on the specific circumstances in each case.\n\n\n\tSettlement of any claim will normally be dealt with on an indemnity basis, ie the value of the article at the time of loss or damage with due allowance for wear, tear and depreciation.  A liability policy is not an ���All Risks��� policy whereby a claim would normally be dealt with on a new for old basis similar to a Household policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated - Amendment No. 298 May 2001\n\n\n\t\t\tTerms & Conditions\t��2011 Crown Copyright\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n",

Assembly Government revenue support funding of £350,000 is being provided over three years, plus £159,000 in the form of a Transport Grant. In addition, Carmarthenshire County Council is providing around £83,000.\n\nIeuan Wyn Jones, Deputy First Minister and Minister for the Economy and Transport said:\n\n\n\"The service helps many people living in rural communities to overcome the barriers to accessing employment, training and other educational opportunities resulting from poor public transport. It is a key commitment of One Wales to drive forward sustainable, local transport initiatives and help to create more sustainable communities.\n\n\"The scheme combines the latest technologies including GPS and scheduling software, to achieve a more effective and efficient integrated rural public transport network.\"\n\n\n\nMr Jones added:\n\n\n\"The Welsh Assembly Government has a commitment to ensure economic prosperity for the whole of our country – north and south, east and west, and in rural and urban communities alike, and that demands effective transport links that allow quick and efficient movement of people and freight.\"\n\n\n\n\n11 December 2009\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\nDelicious\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout social bookmarking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\nLinks\n\nPublic Transport\n\n\n\nTags\n\nTransport\n11 December 2009\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews by topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll topics \n\n\tBusiness and economy \n\n\tChildren and young people \n\n\tCulture and sport \n\n\tEducation and skills \n\n\tEnvironment and countryside \n\n\tEquality and diversity \n\n\tFirst Minister \n\n\tHealth and social care \n\n\tHousing and community \n\n\tImproving public services \n\n\tInternational \n\n\tLocal government \n\n\tPlanning \n\n\tSocial justice \n\n\tSustainable development \n\n\tTourism \n\n\tTransport \n\n\tWelsh language \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by region \n\n\n\n\n\n\tNorth Wales\n\tMid Wales\n\tSouth West Wales\n\tSouth East Wales\n\tAll Wales\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews by date \n\n\n\n\n \n\nApril 2011\n\tM\tT\tW\tT\tF\tS\tS\n\t<< Mar\t \t \n\t \t \t \t \t1\t2\t3\n\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\n\t11\t12\t13\t14\t15\t16\t17\n\t18\t19\t20\t21\t22\t23\t24\n\t25\t26\t27\t28\t29\t30\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\nHome|\n\n\t\nAbout|\n\n\t\nNews|\n\n\t\nTopics|\n\n\t\nPublications|\n\n\t\nConsultation|\n\n\t\nLegislation|\n\n\t\nFunding|\n\n\t\nCampaigns|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n©\nCopyright Statement\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nNational Assembly for Wales\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nScottish Government\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nNorthern Ireland Executive\n\n|\n\n\t\n\nDirectGov\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\t\n",

The theme this year is ‘Fairer Health Outcomes for All’ which is taken from the health inequalities action plan launched in 2011.  The annual cost to the economy of dealing with the consequences of health inequities in Wales could be as much as £4 billion per year. This is caused by the cost of additional illness, productivity losses, lost taxes and higher welfare payments. \n                \nRead more...\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n        « previous | Page 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n of 14 | next »\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n      \n    \n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMae Ffordd Well Ar Gael\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t    Cynllun pum pwynt Llafur ar gyfer swyddi yng Nghymru\n\n1.    Treth o £2 biliwn ar fonysau banc i ariannu mwy o gyfleoedd am swyddi a hyfforddiant ar gyfer pobl ifanc yng Nghymru.\n  \n                \nDarllen hychwaneg...\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNeges Carwyn Jones i gynadleddwyr Cymru yng Nghynhadledd y Blaid Lafur yn Lerpwl\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t    Neges Carwyn Jones i gynadleddwyr Cymru yng Nghynhadledd y Blaid Lafur yn Lerpwl:\n\n\"Y penwythnos hwn, byddaf yn Lerpwl ar gyfer cynhadledd y Blaid Lafur.

Gellir rhoi cymorth grant i waith allanol i adeiladau mewn Ardaloedd Cadwraeth ar yr amod bod y gwaith yn gwneud cyfraniad sylweddol tuag at ddiogelu neu wella'r ardal honno. Bydd nifer o awdurdodau cynllunio lleol yn gweithio gyda Cadw wrth ariannu Cynlluniau Tref ar y cyd fydd yn rhoi cymorth ar gyfer atgyweirio nodweddion allanol adeilad. \nMae'r Cyngor Ymghyngorol Adeiladau Hanesyddol yn gorff ymgynghorol annibynnol gyda'i aelodau yn cael eu penodi gan y Cynulliad Cenedlaethol er mwyn cynghori ar grantiau a dulliau eraill o ddiogelu adeiladau hanesyddol a threfluniau.

Mae Cymdeithasau Dinesig a grwpiau gwirfoddol eraill wedi eu lleoli ledled Cymru hefyd yn chwarae rhan bwysig wrth hyrwyddo diddordeb yn y dreftadaeth adeiledig. Bydd Cadw'n cynnal cysylltiadau gyda chyrff o'r fath. Rhoddir cymorth ariannol, er enghraifft, i'r Gronfa Dreftadaeth Bensaern��ol, Ymddiriedolaeth Ddinesig Cymru, ac i gymdeithasau amwynderau cenedlaethol fel y Victorian Society, Georgian Group a'r Cyngor Archeoleg Prydeinig.

Guess my invite to the launch party of TorbjÃ¸rn RÃ¸dland's The Andy Capp Variations got lost in the post. \"RÃ¸dland employs the comic strip character of Andy Capp as the starting point for a series of black and white photographs. Repeating the same drawn image of this character, these photographs seem motivated by an interest in nivellation; an attempt at having the photographs neither appear as portrait, nor landscape, nor still life.\" Nivellation? I think it means to make level.\n\t21 March. Interview: Eddie Campbell.\n\t21 March.

I hope you all enjoyed the Princess Marigold. If you haven't listened to it, give it a try when you've got youngsters around over Christmas. It runs half an hour in total and my original idea was to use flash animation, using panels from the original comic strip, to stop the little darlings from getting bored sitting still with nothing to watch but the pictures in their heads. Sadly, doing that kind of thing is beyond my abilities. If you, or anyone you know, wants to have a bash, let me know.\n\nI'm glad I've had the opportunity to broadcast it—I would have hated to see all that hard work go to waste and while it might not be to everybody's tastes we had a hoot making it.  I just wish we'd  had  the chance to keep up the impetus and make something a little more substantial. But now I've figured out how to make audio available on Bear Alley, I might have to sniff around and see what else I can make available.\n\nTalking of comics appearing in other media... the day Princess Marigold started, Rebellion and 2000AD CEO and Creative Director Jason Kingsley confirmed that they have partnered up with DNA Films (28 Weeks Later, Sunshine) to put a new Judge Dredd movie into production in 2009. \"We can't give away too many details at this point,\" says Kingsley, \"but we're looking forward to working with DNA Films to bring Judge Dredd back to the big screen.\"\n\nIf they can get Danny Boyle aboard it should be a winner. And, for all our sakes, don't throw away the best line Dredd has like they did in the Stallone movie. To waste such a line was a tragedy and you just knew, from that moment a few minutes in, that they were making a movie that just happened to share some similarities with Judge Dredd rather than putting the real Judge Dredd up on the screen. If The Dark Knight has taught us anything its that you can have a dark, blackly humorous film with no sidekick and no love interest. Go DNA. And try not to spoil it.\n\nI'm writing this on the eve of Christmas Eve so there's a good chance that nobody will be reading this until after Christmas when they get back to work—I know what you lot are like!—but to the few who are left, I'd like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I'm away for a few days now so I'll leave you with this little gem from way back in 1945, drawn by Hugh McNeill. Happy Christmas, everyone.\n\n(* Illustrations: top of column © Look and Learn Magazine Ltd.; Judge Dredd © Rebellion; Deed-a-Day Danny © IPC Media.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nSteve\n\n\nat\n7:23 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail This\n\nBlogThis!\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Facebook\n\nShare to Google Buzz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels:\nComics News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\nARCHAVIST\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\ncool looking comic - but who is the character with the slicked back hair above the title?

I've enjoyed your daily blog since I discovered it. It was fascinating seeing a Look & Learn picture (from my relative youth) & a Judge Dredd picture (from my present)-  many feel 2000 AD has seen better days but there are still some strong stories from time to time - especially JD himself. Most of the classic characters have never been replaced & reimaginings, etc of Slaine, Rogue Trooper & Strontium Dog - both Johnny Alpha & Durham Red - have been disappointing. The ABC Warriors keep limping along but appear to be gloss but no substance much as I respect the majority of Pat Mills' work. An idea for a new graphic novel would be the Look & Learn strip stories that accompanied the Trigan Empire such as Dan Dakota, Rob Riley & Jason January.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nDec 24, 2008 10:36:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSteve\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nSorry to hear you're working, David. Thanks for the compliments. It's the comments and contacts that I get from Bear Alley keep me going.\n\nMike, there are a number of ideas floating around for reprints but none of them nailed down as yet. The only firm title at the moment is a reprint of a \"Three Musketeers\" strip. I've a meeting in January where a few others will hopefully be given the green light. Fingers crossed.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nDec 24, 2008 11:15:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nA Musketeers reprint?\nWill it be Giovaninni's?\nShot from the original art?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nDec 26, 2008 5:57:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSteve\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nNope.

Reps of National Grid and SP Energy Networks called by my office to outline the awful options still on the table. They are all very nice people. But it was a bit like meeting your very nice doctor, who is also a friend, offering you the choice of ripping out your right eye or ripping out your left eye. There's no option of keeping both eyes - the Hospital Trust CEO has decided that your features must be desecrated. Anyway, this post is about the stage that these desecration plans have reached.\n\nFirst issue is the location of the 20 acre sub station into which all the wind farms will connect. After months of discussion with statutory agencies (including Powys Council), there is a short list of two sites - one near Abermule and one near Bowen's Quarry in Adfa. It matters big-time which is chosen. If its Adfa, the 400kv cable carried on 50 metre high steel pylons will pass down the Vyrnwy Valley all the way from Adfa to connect with the Grid in Shropshire. If its Abermule, the cable will pass down the Severn Valley to Shropshire - or further South, with most of its length being the other side of Offa's Dyke. I'm told its a 50/50 call, and the consultation responses will make the difference. \n\nSecond big issue is how much of the cable will be 'undergrounded'. When I last met today's harbingers, there seemed little prospect of any of the cable going underground. The 'tone' has definitely changed, and we need to make a loud noise about this. Not that 'undergrounding' is undisruptive. Burying a 400kv cable makes a very big mess indeed - and its only likely in some places. Personally, I hope we can maximise it. \n\nThird issue is the network of 132kv cables running from the various wind farms to the sub station. These are going to be carried on 25/30 metre high steel pylons. At present there seems little prospect of much of this network being buried underground, because its an upfront cost for the wind farm developer - which could render several of the wind farms uneconomic. \"So bl****y what\" I hear you scream - or was it me. Problem is that SP Energy have a statutory responsibility to the wind farm developers - and if some drop out, the cables could well have been built in the wrong place.\n\nFourth issue is the timetable. The plan is that the consultation period will end in early summer (June-ish) and the cruel, fateful axe will fall September-ish - announcing which valley in what is the most beautiful landscape of the UK will be desecrated for ever. My fingers twitch with barely controlled anger as I type these words. Hope does remain. Its all madness of course - the same sort of unseeing madness which created the much lauded tower blocks and coniferous forests of the 1960s. Let's hope that this blindness be cured, before we lose much of what the unafflicted lovers of Montgomeryshire, love to look out upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nGlyn Davies\n\n\nat\n22:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nInstead of spending a fortune on such ugly infra-structure y not manufacture hydrogen on site?  That way all of the electricity generated can be used to make hydrogen and hydrogen can be used in all sorts of ways including driving machines and presents one way of effectively storing electricity for later use.  Wales could be among the first countries to get a local hydrogen economy going!  It's a great 'starter' element to make other things.  \nChris Wood, PhD (Chemistry)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nFri Mar 18, 11:24:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nSpot on. The greedy on shore wind farm developers have had the ear of the government for far too long, and it is high time that the 'green tinted spectacles' of Chris Huhne and Jane Davidson were thrown in the bin. It is time for common sense to prevail and have the ridiculous renwable policies re written to prevent the needless destruction of beatiful parts of Britain such as Mid Wales hefore it is too late. There must be more MPs and AMs like you that can see the bigger picture.

Once the power lines are built there will be pressure to locate even more windfarms in Powys because the argument will be that Mid Wales is already spoiled so there should be further concentration here to save other parts of Wales. \n\nDon't understand the argument that 132kV power lines can't be under grounded because Scottish Power have a statutory responsibility to connect them whatever the environmental costs. The large energy companies building some of the large windfarms here will be making billions of pounds of profit this year yet they can't pay to underground power lines in Mid Wales?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nSun Mar 20, 12:48:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlyn Davies\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nChris - Beyond my knowledge but ounds good!\n\nAnon 1 - It is a monster.\n\nAnon 2 - Both National Grid and SP Networks have statutory duties.  I do not know the precise wording of the duties, but I believe SP Networks are obliged to offer connections with some regard to cost, which it passes on to developers in the connection charges. It may well be that if the 132kv cables (for which SP Networks is responsible) are put underground, the cost would make some wind fams uneconomic. Now you and I and thousands of others might think this rather welcome, but I'm not sure whether SP Networks could sustain its position under legal challenge. I will continue to call for as much of the cabling to be underground as possible.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nSun Mar 20, 12:19:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFran\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nPlease Glyn, make your opposition known in the County Times - we need to open the eyes of all the local people. \n\nWhen we found out about this awful business, we went to see some of our neighbours - and not one had bothered to look at the \"Project News\" for the National Grid. Also I'm sure it was a deliberate ommision, but the map with the route corridors was not included in the information, nor was it published in the County Times last week, and not everyone has access to the Internet, several of our neighbours being a case in point. No-one seemed to know anything about it, and I have to say one or two were rather apathetic to the news, even though they will be directly affected as the route goes right over them. This is the proposed route from Cefn Coch.\n\nI have a horrible feeling that this will be the preferred route, as that's where most of the hideous turbines are situated already and where there are many more planning applications impending (rumour has it that our esteemed AM and his in-laws have applied for turbines on their land too.)\n\nSo we cannot expect any support from our local AM as he has been instrumental in pushing for windfarms to be allowed all over Montgomeryshire.A lot of the blame for this lies firmly at his door.\n\nAs you say - putting the lines underground will make a terrible mess and mean wholesale destruction of woodland, but that has to be better than our beautiful valley being desecrated for ever by huge steel pylons.\n\nWe are trying to drum up support for a local campaign, but I fear we have quite a fight on our hands, so we need all the support we can get.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nSun Mar 20, 04:50:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nI do not share your view glyn.\n\nI believe that the regeneration the cables will bring to the area will be great. in time, as others have pointed out, mid wales could benefit by creating new green jobs, not all connected to wind power but other forms of renewable energy.\nThe potential here is massive and should be capitalised upon. we need someone with passion and vision to see this through.\n\nSadly our future generations can not rely on coal, gas or oil to generate heat and electricity and alternatives must be looked in to.\n\nI would love to know how many nuclear power stations the uk would need to be self suficiant in producing it's own electricity without having to import from other countries. and with an increase of nuclear power stations comes a greater increase of threats from god knows what!!!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nMon Mar 21, 03:52:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDolgead Hall Caravan and Lodge Park\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nKnowledge is power!\n\nPlease please get the full details of the Cefn Coch route published in the County Times.\n\nEveryone I have spoken to are blissfully ignorant of the implications.\n\nCan we find out what we acn do to campaign against it?\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nMon Mar 21, 02:06:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nhow will power cables bring regeneration? don't we already have an electricity supply\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nMon Mar 21, 11:19:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeo Harris\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nRe: Anon 21st March:\n\nI work in the energy industry and I know exactly how inefficient on-shore wind turbines are to run and maintain.

There are (was) quite a few people directly and indirectly employed in this industry and many more could be if it wasn't for all the negativity against it. We need to accept change to create a better future. I have lived in Mid Wales all my life, I love and enjoy the countryside in many ways but I want myself and my children to have a future here with employment. I believe there is a balance to be had. By the way, a 132KV line can be erected on wooden poles as seen with the Manweb application from Llandinam to Welshpool which also has a lot of opposition. Seems certain people, although believe in renewable energy don't want to see anything new in their back yard.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nTue Mar 22, 04:13:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\nwe have to embrace change. in years to come, the only employment options in montgomery will be in agriculture, nursing home care workers, and tesco check out workers on minimum wage.\n\nMake a difference and allow this renewable energy industry to expand for the long term benefit of this forgotten county.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWed Mar 23, 12:19:00 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\n\n132kV power lines can be put underground, but the greedy wind farm developers won't pay for the lines to be undergrounded.

As hundreds of these blinking things are going to be built what will happen to the 'run-off' from the concrete?? I don't think anyone has thought of that, and if 'they' have then 'they've' kept quiet about it.  Then there is the aspect of huge vortexes being created by the turbines. They also create 'cloud', and when it is windy, the effect for people further away from the turbines, will be similar to that of a hurricane or typhoon.

A similar survey undertaken in 2008 showed that just 4,800 full time equivalent employees were working across all three sectors.\n\nBetween 2007/8 and 2009/10, employment in the wind power industry rose by 91%.  Which makes it pretty much unique, where the British economy is concerned.  Evidently, wind power really is a growth industry.\n\nThere are, of course, denialists who will claim that all this employment is down solely to government subsidies - but as we've seen, they're incapable of talking sense or getting their facts right.  Intriguingly, one person who pointed out the high level of Danish subsidies to their wind power industry implicitly confirmed that Denmark is continuing to invest in wind energy, contrary to the false claims put about by nimby groups, pro-nuclear lobbyists and certain wayward politicians.\n\nOf course, there's a long way to go.  Only today, a joint study by Accenture and Barclays has called upon European governments to invest some 2.9 trillion euros in renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure over the next decade.  That's right: Barclays and Accenture - hardly the greenest and most eco-friendly of institutions.  Approximately one quarter of that investment should go towards funding low-carbon electricity production, say the report's authors.\n\nTaken together, these two up-to-the-minute reports reveal a very clear picture.  Wind energy is blossoming at a time when so many other sectors are struggling.  Economists are demanding massive investment in renewables.  The future is bright, the future is green.\n\nSo how on earth do we shut up the looney brigade who keep trying to turn back the clock?  Suggestions on a postcard, please.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nAEOLUS\n\n\nat\n04:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Post\n\n\nOlder Post\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK WEB ARCHIVE\n\n\n'Wind of Change' has been archived by the British Library as part of their Special Collection on 'Energy' and under the subject 'Society & Culture'.

          "Nordpeis roma stoves – woodburning stove – wood stove UK\n\nNordpeis Roma\n\n\nTypes of Nordpeis Roma\n\n\nNordpeis Roma Stove\n\n\n\nThe Nordpeis roma stove can fit equally well in a traditional room or a clean uncluttered modern setting. This woodburning stove gives out up to 8kW of radiant and convected warmth, which makes the roma stove suited to heating a medium sized room or to supplement the heating in a large room. An airwash system keeps the curved glass door clear of deposits and the firebox features secondary combustion to promote efficient woodburning.

That is what happened here a few years ago. Along with government crackdowns on extremism, this type of actvitity has lessened the threat of animal rights extremism in the UK.\n\nMost of the mass media are not so interested when they do not perceive a polarised debate or are not chasing news on the latest violent attack. So when the going is not so tough, like here in the UK, there are fewer opportunities to tell people through the media why and how animal research is conducted. But there is still plenty to do behind the scenes, working with politicians, schools and researchers, for instance.\n\nElsewhere the violent and vociferous opposition is as active as ever. In the USA, building on efforts to promote the importance of lifesaving research involving animals, UCLA has placed a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times urging people to sign a petition.\n\nThe ad was published on Sunday 18 October, and can be seen here. It asks readers to sign the US Pro-Test for Science petition, which has been in circulation for six months since this branch of Pro-Test was formed. Those with long memories will recall that Pro-Test started in the UK nearly four years ago, as an Oxford-based student group. At that time Oxford University was under attack by animal rights activists because it was building a new biomedical research centre that would house laboratory animals.\n\nThe Pro-Test for Science petition states that ethical and humane animal research is a cornerstone in our understanding of basic biological processes and the development of new treatments and therapies such as cancer medicines, antibiotics, vaccines and organ transplants. More than 10,000 people have signed up, including Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine.\n\n'It's important that UCLA demonstrate strong support for researchers who have been subjected to violence and harassment by anti-animal research extremists and that the public understand the vital role animal research at UCLA plays in improving our lives,' UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said. 'It's equally important that the public understand that lab animals are utilised only when no alternative exists, that UCLA is committed to the highest standards of care and that research is subjected to strict oversight, including unannounced inspections, by federal regulators.'\n\nThe LA Times advertisement was timed to coincide with National Primate Liberation Week, when extremists typically post and distribute misleading or false information about animal research. It also co-incided with the big meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago which finishes today. The meeting included a symposium on how best to reach out and garner more support for animal research, and to encourage more scientists to speak out.\n\nA scientist blogged from the SfN meeting:\n\n'In the UK, people have vocally supported animal research, marches in support have easily outnumbered and overwhelmed the vocal minority.

This species has developed resistance to most insecticides although a class of compounds called the neonicotinoids have remained an effective and popular control measure. However, recent cases of neonicotinoid resistance in M. persicae represent a threat to the long-term effectiveness of these insecticides as well. \nWork on other insect species has shown that resistance can arise through increased production of metabolic enzymes called cytochrome P450s that detoxify the insecticide. A new study of neonicotinoid resistance in M. persicae, published in PLOS genetics by scientists at Rothamsted Research, an institute of BBSRC, and collaborators at University College London, is the first to find resistance associated with an increase in the number of copies of a P450 gene in a major agricultural pest.\n\n\n\nThe study made use of recent advances in genomics to investigate all genes encoding detoxification enzymes in a resistant strain of M. persicae. Dr Chris Bass, who led the genomics research said, ‘This study builds on the work of Graham Moores and Despina Philippou at Rothamsted, who provided strong evidence of a role for P450-mediated detoxification in resistance*. Now we have demonstrated that resistance is associated with multiple duplications of a single P450 gene, with the resistant aphids carrying ~18 copies of the gene compared to the normal 2 copies found in susceptible aphids.’ This may enable aphids to rapidly breakdown insecticides and so avoid death.\n\n\n\nGenomic analyses also revealed that several genes encoding proteins that make up the insect cuticle are over-expressed in resistant aphids. The paper’s lead author, Dr Mirel Puinean said, ‘This suggests that an increase in the production of cuticular proteins in resistant aphids could reduce the amount of neonicotinoids that penetrate the insect’s body and our biochemical assays supported this.’ However, further work is needed to discover exactly how the increased production of cuticular proteins boosts the body armour of aphids that are resistant to insecticides.\n\n\n\nLevels of neonicotinoid resistance currently being reported are insufficient to impair the field effectiveness of these insecticides. However, this work highlights the remarkable capacity of aphids to adapt and the need for continued research and informed management strategies to prevent resistance becoming more potent and widespread.\nRelated links\n » BBSRC Institute Career Path Fellowship:  A genomic approach to understanding insecticide resistance in crop pests\n » University College London\n » Guidelines on managing resistance in M. persicae by the Insecticide Resistance Action Group (IRAG)\nContacts\n » Chris Bass, Graham Moores, Despina Philippou, Mirel Puinean, Ian Denholm, Martin Williamson and Lin Field\nNotes to Editors\nThis paper is published in PLOS genetics as “Amplification of a cytochrome P450 gene is associated with resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides in the aphid Myzus persicae” by Alin M.

It is thought that hormonal influences may be the reason why migraines affect more women than men. For example, some women find that migraine attacks are more frequent around the time of their period. However, this association has not been fully proven. \n\nIt is possible for migraines to begin later in life. However, it is more common for the condition to begin in childhood or as a young adult. About 90 per cent of people who experience migraines have their first one before they are 40 years old. \n\nTypes of migraine\n\nThere are two types of migraine - classical and common:\n\n\tClassical migraine is when the headache follows a series of symptoms, known as aura (see the 'symptoms' section). \n\tCommon migraine is when a person does not experience aura symptoms. \n\n\nSome people experience migraine attacks frequently, such as several times a week. Other people only experience a migraine occasionally. For example, it is possible for years to pass between migraine attacks. \n\n \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Symptoms\n\n            The main symptom of a migraine is an intense headache. This usually occurs at the front, or on one side, of the head. However, during a migraine attack, the area of pain can sometimes change position. The pain can feel like a throbbing sensation and it can be moderate, or severe. The throbbing is usually made worse when you move.\n\nClassical migraine symptoms (with aura)\n\nAura means a warning sign. It is the name that is used to describe the symptoms that you experience before the migraine begins. Around 1 in 4 people who experience migraines have additional aura symptoms. These can include: \n\n\tVisual problems - you may experience visual disturbances, such as flashing lights, zigzag patterns, blind spots, and other visual distortions. \n\tStiffness - you may have stiffness, or a tingling sensation like pins and needles in your neck, shoulders, or limbs. \n\tProblems with coordination - you may feel disorientated, or off-balance. \n\tDifficulty speaking - you may find it difficult to express yourself properly using words. \n\tLoss of consciousness - this only happens in very rare cases. \n\n\nAura symptoms typically start between 15 minutes and 1 hour before the headache begins. Some people may experience aura with only a very mild headache. \n\nCommon migraine symptoms \n\nSymptoms associated with a common migraine include: \n\n\tNausea - you may feel queasy and sick. This may sometimes be followed by vomiting. \n\tIncreased sensitivity - you may experience photophobia (sensitivity to light), phonophobia (sensitivity to sound), and/or osmophobia (sensitivity to smells). This is why many people who have migraines want to rest in a quiet, dark room. \n\n\nThe symptoms of a common migraine often begin at the same time as the headache. However, these symptoms will usually disappear once the headache eases. \n\nOther associated symptoms \n\nDuring either a common or classical migraine, a number of associated symptoms can sometimes occur. These symptoms can include:\n\n\tpoor concentration \n\tsweating \n\tfeeling very hot, or very cold \n\tabdominal pain (which can sometimes cause diarrhoea), and \n\ta frequent need to pass urine. \n\n\nHowever, not everyone experiences associated symptoms, and they do not usually all occur at once.\n\nThe symptoms of a migraine can last anywhere between 4-72 hours (3 days). In between each migraine attack, all associated symptoms will usually disappear. You may feel very tired after a migraine attack, and this feeling can sometimes last for several days afterwards. \n\n \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Causes\n\n            It is thought that migraines may be caused by changes in the chemicals of the brain. In particular, the level of the serotonin - the message-sending chemical - decreases during a migraine. \n\nLow levels of serotonin can make the blood vessels in a part of your brain spasm (suddenly contract) which makes them narrower. This may cause the symptoms of aura. Soon after, the blood vessels then dilate (widen), which is thought to be the cause of the headache. However, the exact cause of the drop in serotonin levels is not yet fully understood.\n\nHormones\n\nSome scientists believe that hormones are closely linked to the cause of migraines. Some women who experience migraines say that they are more likely to have an attack around the time of their period. This is known as a menstrual migraine. Fluctuating hormones are thought to be the reason why more females have migraines compared with males.\n\nJust before women have their period, levels of the hormone, oestrogen, fall. It is not the low levels of oestrogen that cause a migraine, but it is linked to the changes from one level to another. \n\nWomen can experience menstrual migraines anytime between two days before to three days after the first day of their period. About one in seven women who experience migraines only have an attack around the time of their period. This is known as a pure menstrual migraine. However, it is possible to have migraine attacks around the time of your menstrual period and at other times as well. This happens to around 6 in 10 women who experience migraines. \n\nMigraine triggers\n\nMany factors have been identified as triggering the onset of a migraine. These triggers include emotional, physical, dietary, environmental, and medicinal factors. \n\nEmotional\n\nEmotional factors that can trigger a migraine can include:\n\n\tstress, \n\tanxiety, \n\ttension, \n\tshock, \n\tdepression, or \n\texcitement. \n\n\nPhysical\n\nExamples of physical factors that can trigger a migraine include:\n\n\ttiredness, \n\tpoor sleep quality, \n\tshift work, \n\tpoor posture, \n\tneck, or shoulder, tension, and \n\ttravelling for a long periods of time. \n\n\nThe menopause can also trigger migraines. \n\nDietary\n\nDietary triggers of a migraine may include: \n\n\tlack of food (dieting), \n\tdelayed or irregular meals, \n\tdehydration, \n\talcohol, \n\tfood additives (specifically tyramine), \n\tcaffeine products, such as tea and coffee, and \n\tspecific foods like chocolate, citrus fruit, and cheese. \n\n\nEnvironmental\n\nEnvironmental factors that may cause migraines include: \n\n\tbright lights, \n\tflickering screens, such as a television or computer screen, \n\tsmoking (or smoky rooms), \n\tloud noises, \n\tchanges in climate, such as changes in humidity or very cold temperatures, \n\tstrong smells, and \n\ta stuffy atmosphere (a lack of fresh air). \n\n\nMedicinal\n\nSome medicines can trigger migraines, including some sleeping tablets, the contraceptive pill, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is sometimes used to treat the menopause.\n\n \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Diagnosis\n\n            \n\nWhen to visit your GP\n\nMigraines can often be treated at home using over-the-counter (OTC) medication and self-help techniques. However, you should see your GP if you feel that painkillers, such as paracetamol, are not working, or you experience any of the things listed below.\n\n\tYou have aura symptoms that occur on the same side of your body with every attack. \n\tYour first ever migraine occurs when you are over 50 years of age. \n\tYour usual migraine symptoms have changed. \n\tYour migraine attacks are becoming more frequent. \n\n\nDiagnosing migraine\n\nThere is no specific test to diagnose migraine. On your first visit, your GP may give you a physical and neurological examination. This includes an examination of your mental functions by checking your vision, coordination, reflexes, and sensations. These checks will be carried out to make sure that there are no other underlying conditions that are causing your symptoms.\n\nTo give an accurate migraine diagnosis, your GP must identify a pattern of reoccurring headaches, alongside the associated symptoms. Migraines can be unpredictable, with differing periods of time where no symptoms are experienced. Therefore, obtaining an accurate diagnosis can sometimes be a lengthy process. \n\nTo help with the diagnosis, it can be useful to keep a diary of your migraine attacks. You should note down details including the date, time, and what you were doing when the migraine began. It is also helpful to make a note of the food you ate that day, as this can help your GP to identify any potential triggers\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Treatment\n\n            There is currently no cure for migraine. However, a number of treatment methods can be used to treat the symptoms of migraine. Treatments are mostly in the form of medicines. It may take time to work out which is the best method of treatment for you. For example, you may have to try different types of medicines, or different combinations, before you find the most effective ones. \n\nPainkillers\n\nMany people who experience migraine find that over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, such as painkillers, help to ease their symptoms. Paracetamol and aspirin are painkillers that are commonly used to treat a migraine.\n\nWhen taking paracatemol, or aspirin, always make sure that you read the instructions on the packaging, and follow the dosage recommendations.\n\nChildren under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is under the specific guidance of a healthcare specialist.\n\nAspirin is also not recommended for adults who have (or have had in the past) stomach problems, such as a peptic ulcer, liver problems or kidney problems.\n\nPainkillers are usually the first method of treatment for migraine, and they tend to be more effective if they are taken at the first signs of a migraine attack. This gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms.\n\nSome people only take painkillers when their headache becomes very bad. However, this is not advisable because it is often too late for the painkiller to work. Soluble painkillers (tablets that dissolve in a glass of water) are a good choice because they are absorbed quickly by your body.\n\nIf you cannot swallow painkillers due of nausea, or vomiting, suppositories may be a better option. These are 'bullet-shaped' capsules that contain specific medicines. The suppository is inserted into the anus (back passage).\n\nStronger types of painkillers are also available, but they need to be prescribed either by your GP, or by a specialist.\n\nAnti-inflammatory medicines\n\nDue to their anti-inflammatory properties, you may find that anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen, are more effective in treating your symptoms of migraine.\n\nYou can buy ibuprofen over-the-counter (OTC) at the pharmacists, and it is also available on prescription. However, as with aspirin, you should not take ibuprofen if you have (or have had in the past) stomach problems, such as a peptic ulcer, or if you have liver, or kidney problems.\n\nDiclofenac, naproxen, and tolfenamic acid are other types of anti-inflammatory medicines that are only available on prescription\n\nAnti-sickness medicines\n\nIf nausea is a symptom of your migraine, you can take anti-sickness medicines. These can be prescribed by your GP, and can be taken alongside painkillers. Ask your GP about anti-sickness medicines. \n\nAs with painkillers, anti-sickness medicines work better if taken as soon as your migraine symptoms begin. Anti-sickness medicines usually come in the form of a tablet, but they are also available in the form of a suppository.\n\nCombination medicines\n\nThere are a number of combination medicines for migraine, which you can buy over-the-counter (OTC) at your local pharmacy. These medicines contain both painkillers and anti-sickness medicines. If you are not sure which medicine is best for you, ask your pharmacist for advice. \n\nMany people who experience migraines find that combination medicines are convenient. However, you may find that either the doses of painkillers, or anti-sickness medicine, are not high enough to combat your symptoms. If this is the case, you may prefer to take painkillers and anti-sickness medicines separately. This will allow you to easily control the doses of each. Again, ask your GP or pharmacist if you are not sure about which medication is most suitable for you.\n\nTriptan medicines\n\nIf ordinary painkillers are not helping to relieve your migraine symptoms, triptan medicines might be the next option. Triptan medicines are only prescribed by your GP, or by a specialist. \n\nTriptan medicines are not the same as painkillers. They make the blood vessels around the brain contract. This combats the dilating (widening) blood vessels, which are believed to be part of the migraine process. Triptans are available in the form of tablets, injections, and nasal sprays. \n\nSome triptan medicines work for some people but not for others. If one type of triptan medicine does not seem to be working, you should see your GP and ask them about other types. \n\nComplementary medicines\n\nSome people find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and homeopathy, help with migraines. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence as to the effectiveness of such treatment methods. \n\n \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Complications\n\n            There are several complications that are linked to migraine:\n\nStroke \n\nMigraine is associated with a small increased risk of ischaemic stroke. An ischaemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked by a blood clot, or fatty material in the arteries.\n\nAlthough it has been identified as a risk factor, the reasons why ischaemic stroke is linked to migraine are not entirely clear. However, an ischaemic stroke as a result of a migraine is very rare. \n\nAnother risk factor for ischaemic stroke is the use of the combined oral contraceptive pill. The general advice of medical professionals is that women who experience migraine with aura should avoid using the combined contraceptive pill.\n\nWomen who experience migraine without aura are able to take the combined contraceptive pill. However, if you take the combined contraceptive pill, and you experience aura symptoms, or if your migraines become more frequent, you should see your GP as soon as possible. They may advise you to stop taking the combined contraceptive pill. \n\nMental health problems\n\nMigraine is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems including:\n\n\tdepression, \n\tmanic depression, \n\tanxiety disorder, and \n\tpanic disorder. \n\n\nAlthough migraine and mental health problems are linked, they are believed to have different causes. For more information about migraines and depression, see the 'selected links' section. \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Prevention\n\n            Although there is no cure for migraine, it is possible to bring the condition under control. This can be achieved through treatments and also by taking preventative measures. \n\nTriggers\n\nOne of the best methods of preventing migraines is recognising the signs and the triggers of an attack. This is why keeping a migraine diary is helpful. For example, if you experience a migraine on several different occasions, after eating certain foods, you should avoid eating them. The same applies for avoiding other known triggers, such as avoiding stress, or anxiety. \n\nRecognising the signs\n\nSome people who experience migraines begin to feel unwell before a migraine attack. This can be up to a day, or so, before the more obvious symptoms, like a headache, begin. \n\nThe strange feelings that are sometimes experienced prior to having a migraine are known as the prodrome, and are often the first signs of a migraine attack. These can include:\n\n\ta change in mood, \n\ttiredness, \n\thyperactivity, or \n\tfood cravings. \n\n\nHowever, as these feelings are not specific to migraine, it can be difficult to identify them as warning signs. Your relatives, or friends, might be first to notice these changes. \n\nMedication \n\nMedication is available to prevent a migraine attack. These medicines are usually given if you have tried other preventative measures and you are still experiencing migraines. Your GP may also prescribe these medicines if you experience very severe migraine attacks, or if your attacks happen frequently.\n\nMedications used to prevent migraines include:\n\nBeta-blockers \n\nBeta-blockers include propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol. They are traditionally used to treat angina and high blood pressure. It is not currently known how beta-blockers work to prevent migraine attacks. Beta-blockers are unsuitable for some people with asthma. Side effects of beta-blockers can include hallucinations, cold hands and feet, and tiredness.\n\nAnti-depressants \n\nAmitriptyline is a type of anti-depressant. However, it has been shown to work against migraines in a different way to how it treats depression. The medicine is usually started on a low dose which can be increased if necessary. Amitriptyline can be used together with beta-blockers.\n\nAnticonvulsants \n\nTopiramate is a type of anticonvulsant. Anticonvulsants are usually used to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy. However, they have also been found to help prevent migraines. Topiramate is currently the only anticonvulsant licensed for migraine prevention in the UK.\n\nSerotonin agonists \n\nTwo serotonin agonists are pizotifen and methysergide. Some people who experience migraines find that these medicines can reduce the severity and frequency of their attacks. However, side effects can include drowsiness and weight gain. \n\nKeep a migraine diary\n\nYou should be aware that these medicines may not stop your migraine attacks completely. Keeping a migraine diary will help you, and your GP, to monitor how well the medicine is working. As it can take up to three months for the medicine to take full effect, it is important to keep taking it for at least three months, even if you think that it is not working. \n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n            Selected links\n\n            \tMigraine Action Association\n\n    (Migraine Action Association)\n\tMigraine in children \n\n    (Patient UK)\n\tMigraine \n\n    (BBC Health)\n\tMigraine and depression \n\n    (Migraine Action Association)\n\n\n            ^^ Back to top\n            \n\n        \n            \n\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n\t\n            \n\t\t\n                Did you find this article useful?\n                \n                    \n                    Yes, useful.

They have argued for radical reform after more than a decade of being bounced around and tied up with all of Labour’s bureaucratic indolence.\n\nThe Jury Team are delighted to be reading such endorsement of what has been one of their key policy suggestions for quite some time!  The government should pay for school education but parents, not the government, should have the main responsibility for deciding where their children are educated.  Government should pay schools according to how many pupils they educate and it should pay them more for disadvantaged pupils so that these can have more resources.  However the government does not need to run the schools.  In Holland 67% of schools follow such a funding model, and it is 55% of schools in Ireland.  Furthermore, the US Charter schools, which have generally been very successful, work on the same model.\n\nThere should be a ballot in every school to decide whether to opt out, which would be initiated by the governors or by 5% of the parents requesting this ballot.  It would require a 55% agreement with at least 50% of the families voting and to avoid being tied up in a repetitive campaign where it is clearly not popular, a ballot could be held not more often than once every five years.  \n\nJury Team clearly agree with these Head Teachers in the belief that independence gives back to teachers their professional respect and, subject to the governors, gives Head Teachers the right to manage their school without interference. They understand, unlike the main three parties, that a school must succeed otherwise parents will simply stop sending their children there.  Better still, it allows undersubscribed schools to take measures to improve, and it is shown when such efforts are made the results are tremendous. Furthermore, this gives parents a choice, makes the children the key focus, motivates staff and raises aspirations.\n\nThis General Election vote with YOUR HEAD!\n\n                \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                Gordon Brown … you might just hang yourself, let alone Parliament\n\n                \n                26th April 2010 | 1 Comment\n\n                \n                \n                Perhaps the best result the Tories could have is this:\n\nConservatives – 34%\n\nLiberal Democrats – 30%\n\nLabour – 28%\n\nThis would give Labour an unjustifiable but largest number of MPs, and with it all that Gordon Brown feels he needs to hang onto Number 10.\n\nBut here’s what happens under his first properly elected premiership.  Gordon has to beg for the support of the new larger number of SNP MPs, who under Alex Salmond demand what they have had their mind set on for decades, which is the return of all that oil revenue they believe to have been ’stolen’ by Westminster.  English and Welsh taxes will be diverted up to Edinburgh – the SNP now having forgotten their earlier pledges of allegiance with Plaid Cymru – thereby restoring the power of any bank with the word Scotland in it’s name.  Brown will also have to impose cuts to everything to survive this drain on resources and the imposition of demands from the International Monetary Fund – cuts to civil servant’s paypackets, impoverishing cuts in provision of all public services including the NHS, cuts to the military fighting in Afghanistan.  \n\nThe Public, already very angry at the party coming third being still in charge, will join together and the resultant strikes through first and ‘Autumn of Discontent’ followed by a ‘Winter of Discontent’ will be fed up of Gordon Brown once and and for all.  The Hung Parliament will hang itself and the Liberal Democrats will not support anyone government who doesn’t agree to the first Bill on the Statute Books being the introduction of Proportional Representation.  The Conservatives will rally a vote of “No Confidence” in the Government.  Brown will have no option to go to the country for the second time in 2010, and……. the angry electorate will boot Labour out for a generation.\n\nThe question really is, does a politician have the courage to bide their time?  Perhaps someone should lend David Cameron a history book with the page turned over on Stanley Baldwin (around the election of 1923).\n\nFirst past the post is set to go.  What will happen after that will depend on David Cameron’s courage.  If he gets it right, he WILL be Prime Minister.  If he gets it wrong, PR could remove Conservative government forever.  One way or another, the outcome of the 2010 General Election will see a big name – Labour or Conservative – fall from power for a long time to come.\n\n                \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                Hung Parliament …. “What happened next?”\n\n                \n                25th April 2010 | Add Your Comment\n\n                \n                \n                Get ready!  It seems like a Hung Parliament is a’coming.  So, swot up ahead of time and appear learned about the events we’re likely to see unfold.  Journalists are salivating over the overdrive of excitement we’re about to witness.\n\nDespite the possibility that Gordon Brown might have ‘lost’ the election, it may be that Britain wakes up to find him still there as Prime Minister.  Even though he has lost his majority and even though he no longer represents the largest party, Gordon Brown is the PM until he resigns.  He can (and given desperation most likely he will) seek approval to prepare a Queen’s Speech as if the election has not ever happened.\n\nWhen a PM resigns the Queen invites someone else to become PM, immediately.  There must be no period without government.  The Queen will not get involved in any way with anything that could be deemed partisan and so will not be personally embroiled in negotiations – something that is more to the liking of the parliamentarian end of the gene pool in her realm.  The key thing here is that the Queen is looking for whoever is most capable of getting a Queen’s Speech and Budget passed in the House; usually whoever is leader of the largest party, but not necessarily so.\n\nIt’s all back to the drawing board if a PM loses a vote of confidence and they have to resign, causing the dissolution of Parliament.  That said the Queen could refuse Parliament this right given Parliament has only just been elected.\n\nIt looks like the once forgotten “smoke-filled backrooms” of old will come into their own again as Nick Clegg’s and David Cameron’s henchmen play out a game of political poker with the winner taking to the steps of Number 10.  \n\nThe ‘X Factor” election now becomes more like “Big Brother’s Little Brother” with Sue Barker asking “What happened next?”\n\n                \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                Jury Team calls for NHS budget increases … for British citizens\n\n                \n                24th April 2010 | Add Your Comment\n\n                \n                \n                When voters go to their polling stations on May 6th , those unsure of who they should vote for might want to take a moment to consider how generous they have become.  Whilst it may seem a little harder to get treated under the NHS in the coming years because of austerity measures by whoever is elected as Prime Minister, they can remain confident in the fact that overseas visitors to the UK can access the very same emergency treatment totally free of charge as the British taxpayer.  Regardless of residential status treatment will remain free of charge courtesy of the NHS, which is paid for from the pockets of the British worker’s taxes.  Such generosity by the taxpayer comes from the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations and means that the UK is the only EU country providing totally free healthcare.\n\nThe charitable generosity of the British is yet again proven to rise above all other nationalities, so we all deserve to pat ourselves on the back for paying these bills for non-residents to the UK.\n\nSo, as the proverbial axe falls on the NHS budget, and you as a British taxpayer are sitting in A&E wondering why your child is not being seen by a doctor to help relieve their pain, or your sister is not being treated at the oncology unit because your hospital is a bit strapped for cash, or the operation you were hoping for has been delayed yet again, bear in mind that if only Britain did as other countries in Europe did (eg. Ireland) and required non-EU nationals to have health insurance in order to be treated in a British NHS hospital, then the £4 billion that would have been saved, should this private medical insurance have been a requirement in order to come to the UK, might have been spent on someone more deserving, namely You!\n\n                \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                Second PM’s debate and it’s even more of a 3 horse race!!\n\n                \n                22nd April 2010 | Add Your Comment\n\n                \n                \n                Clegg-mania still lives on, this time through the Sky TV run Prime Ministerial Debate tonight.  The bubble doesn’t seem to have any intention of bursting for the Liberal Democrats.  Far from it if the number of new voter registrations in the first-time voter category are anything to go by.  They seem to have latched onto this ‘new kid on the Westminster block’.\n\nThis “X-Factor Election” strides on, waking up the people from a slumber of ineffectualness of the past six parliaments.  The journalists, excited in the belief they finally have an intently following audience (maybe that’s over-egging it a little) are telling us to “Watch this space!”.\n\n                \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t\n\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                Boundary Changes: Jury Team know as thing or two about saving money\n\n                \n                21st April 2010 | Add Your Comment\n\n                \n                \n                There has been much talk about Boundary Changes affecting the outcome of the coming general election in Britain.  This always happens and it is always talked about.  So what is actually going on and what is going to happen?\n\nThe new House of Commons will start with 650 seats.  Something the Jury Team say is ridiculous as some constituencies are elected upon with 120,000 electorate (such as the Isle of Wight) whereas others have less than half that number of electorate, such as many of the North England inner city areas that typically favour the Labour Party.  That said, boundary reviews generally favour the Conservatives Party simply because the trend is for people to move out of inner city areas towards the suburbs. \n\nSo, we find the 2010 changes create 13 new seats (10 notionally Conservative and 3 Liberal Democrat) with the abolition of 9 seats (two-thirds being Labour). This means that on the current set up, should the 2005 election have been held now Labour’s majority would have been 36 rather than 64.  That said, though the new boundaries favour the Tories, in reality the effect is only marginal. Under the 2005 boundaries Labour would lose it’s majority with a swing of 2.2%, but under the new this is slightly better for the Conservatives who now only require a swing of 1.5%.  And it’s a swing of 6.9% (as opposed to the previous 7.4% to gain an overall majority in the House).\n\nBut though the task has been made that little bit harder for Labour to hang onto power, it seems the Conservatives have hardly been making real headway to secure victory.\n\nSee you again in another five years for yet more boundary changes!!\n\nThe Jury Team continue to argue for larger constituency boundaries and less MPs in the House. They propose for legislation to be introduced in the next Parliamentary calendar for the Boundary Commissions in each of the four nations of the UK to recast the constituencies in time for the general election in 2015.  And with each MP costing an average of more than £600,000 the proposed reduction in the number of Westminster MPs would allow for a saving of more than £130 million for the same job being done.

Matters for debate will include what lessons there are for editors in how other sectors polish their brands and build up trust, and how the consumers' champion itself maintains its enviable reputation.\n\nSamira Ahmed, of Channel 4 News, will chair a session on building trust among print, TV and radio. It will investigate how traditional media organisations have worked hard over many years to develop their trusted brands, and how new media platforms â€“ going free, blogging and citizen journalism â€“ will affect public trust in those brands.\n\nJournalism training will also go under the microscope, with a focus on journalism standards building further trust for the future. A session led by Peter Cole will debate the value of high calibre entrants and top quality training that is easily recognised by editors, potential journalists, and the public.\n\nThe discussions will be followed by the annual gala dinner for hundreds of media guests at the Lowry Centre in neighbouring Salford, future home of the much anticipated Mediacity:uk. Paddy Harverson, Communications Secretary for HRH the Prince of Wales, will speak.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\t\n            \n\n\t\n\n        \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        E-mail this story to a friend.

On my left \nis Frank Cuthbert and also present are Emma Locke and Steve Phipps from the Legal Services \nDepartment. Frank is on the local government side. Is that right?  \n \n[4] Mr Phipps: I am head of the partnership and ethics team within the local government \npolicy division.  \n \n[5] Ms Locke: I am from the Legal Services Department.  \n \n[6] Angela Burns: You are all very welcome here. Before we start questions, do you \nwish to make some brief opening remarks? \n \n[7] Carl Sargeant: Thank you for inviting us to committee today. As you will be aware, \nthe Proposed Local Government (Wales) Measure is large, wide-ranging and quite complex in \nparts. However, its aims are basic and straightforward. The proposed Measure aims to make \nlocal government in Wales more representative, accountable and connected to the people of \nWales. The issues tackled by the proposed Measure have been identified in a series of reviews \nover the last couple of years, such as the expert panel that looked into barriers to becoming a \ncouncillor and the Aberystwyth University review into community and town councillors. The \ngeneral conclusion of those reports was that local government in Wales is less effective and \n 4 04/11/2010 \nless citizen-focused than it could be. That is the premise of the proposed Measure.  \n \n[8] Many of the proposals in the proposed Measure have no cost implications; others do, \nbut in real terms that are relatively small. Obviously, we believe that they are proportionate as \nwell. In drafting the proposed Measure, we were certainly mindful of the situation in which \nwe find ourselves financially and economically, and we have taken that fully into account in \nour submission to you. \n \n[9] We believe that the proposed Measure will deliver much more than can be costed in \nballpark figures. There are long-awaited democratic improvements that have been driving this \nagenda forward, which will deliver efficiencies in the long term through better governance, \nsharper scrutiny and better institutions, which are more responsive to people?s needs in \nWales. This is a long-term agenda, and we are looking at initial costings that are relatively \nsmall at implementation, but will deliver long-term benefits. I am happy to take questions \nfrom you, and, hopefully, we can answer them. \n \n[10] Angela Burns: I will start by thanking you for producing a paper that contained \nfinancial information. I was thrilled by that, and found it most refreshing. However, I am sure \nthat you would not be surprised if I were to say that we have noticed that a fair number of the \nconsultees have expressed concerns that the numbers that you show are significantly \nunderplayed. That was particularly the case with the Welsh Local Government Association, \nwhich estimates that the cost of the new powers and responsibilities, such as additional \nstaffing, remuneration and ICT costs, will be closer to ?500,000 than ?40,000. Could you \ncomment on that, particularly in the light of your statement that we live in an age of austerity \nwhen people are under severe financial pressure? \n \n[11] Carl Sargeant: I am not sure that I accept that the costs have been underestimated. In \nmany cases, the reforms that we plan to impose involve no costs at all for the authorities, and \nmarginal costs for others. Some of the implications that others may have presented are based \non a starting-from-scratch scenario. We are not starting from scratch, and the 22 authorities \nare in very different stages of development. Some of the cost implications are small, and, as I \nsay, authorities are not starting from scratch?many of them are already delivering very good \nservices along these lines. This is about enabling services to be brought to a level that is \nsustainable and consistent across Wales. I do not accept that we have underestimated the cost.  \n \n[12] It is important that we recognise the current financial circumstances, but we should \nnot, as a result, shy away from driving improvement forward. Financial circumstances should \nnot be an excuse not to change the democratic process of developing better services for the \npeople of Wales. \n \n[13] Angela Burns: Could you recount for us briefly the consultation process that you \nwent through? I am thinking particularly of cost-gathering, and the people whom you spoke to \nin order to verify that your costs were accurate. \n \n[14] Carl Sargeant: Perhaps I will ask my team to contribute on the detail of the technical \nelements of how we came to those figures. The broad consultation was based on many \nstudies, such as the Aberystwyth study, the good councillors guide and so on. We brought all \nthat together into a single proposed Measure. The proposed Measure is large, but it is made \nup of several parts, as you will be aware. The costings across the piece are individual, but \nperhaps I can give you examples of where we have estimated some of those costs. \n \n1.10 p.m. \n \n[15] Mr Cuthbert: What the Minister says is correct, obviously. [Laughter.] There were \nfour main consultation exercises: one on proposed reforms to political structures and scrutiny; \n 5 04/11/2010 \none on the report of the expert panel; one was carried out by the independent remuneration \npanel on its proposals for additional powers through the proposed Measure; and one on the \nAberystwyth report on community councils, which my colleague Stephen Phipps dealt with. \nNone of those consultations would have involved detailed costings, because, to a certain \nextent, where costings exist, they are implied in those changes rather than being automatically \nobvious. So, the first time that the detailed costings will have been seen is with the \npublication of the explanatory memorandum. \n \n[16] Angela Burns: Is the committee happy with that? I see that you are. Rosemary, will \nyou take the next set of questions? \n \n[17] Rosemary Butler: Yes. Good afternoon, Minister. The explanatory memorandum \nquotes the costs of surveys as being ?35,000 in total, or around ?1,750 per authority. Is it \nintended that funding will be equally distributed between authorities, or will individual \ncircumstances be taken into account? \n \n[18] Carl Sargeant: The issue of elections varies across the 22 authorities and the \ncommunity and town councils according to the number of elections for county and \ncommunity councillors. So, that will be proportionate to each authority. We will ask \nauthorities to let us know how many candidates there have been, post the close of \nnominations, so it will be proportionate to each authority. \n \n[19] Rosemary Butler: During your appearance before Legislation Committee No. 3, you \nstated that you are trying to move away from hypothecation and specific grants. Is it, \ntherefore, intended that this funding will be included within the revenue support grant, or \ndistributed via some other mechanism? \n \n[20] Carl Sargeant: My commitment to the reduction of specific grants stands. I am still \nworking closely with colleagues on that. I have not only said that to the legislation committee, \nbut also in Plenary. This is slightly different, because we are talking about elections that \nhappen every four years, so it would be difficult to put it into the RSG. This is specifically for \nelections, which only occur every four years, so I envisage this remaining a specific grant. \nThat does not shake my overall commitment, but, practically, it is the right thing to do in this \ncase. \n \n[21] Rosemary Butler: Do you see specific grants and hypothecation as the same thing? I \ndo not. \n \n[22] Carl Sargeant: They are technical terms. They are not the same, but the underlying \nprinciple is similar. \n \n[23] Rosemary Butler: This is my final question. A number of respondents to the \nconsultation expressed the concern that these estimates were significantly underestimated, to \nwhich the Chair has referred. For the record, how would you respond to that and was there \nany consultation with authorities on the amount and distribution of such funding? \n \n[24] Carl Sargeant: It is an interesting question, because authorities are looking far too \ndeeply into this. We are asking for a simple questionnaire, which we will supply, containing \nthe questions that we perceive to be useful. We will translate it and it will be a standard \nassessment form across the whole of Wales. We are not asking for the creation of a super \nform 22 times. That is not what we want. We will ask the councils to send them out, we will \nreimburse the postage and we will not ask them to chase people around the country for their \nresponses. We will make this process simple and we do not expect the delivery of the service \nto be a big challenge.  \n \n 6 04/11/2010 \n[25] Janet Ryder: So, Minister, from what you have said, I understand that the only costs \nthat would fall on local authorities would relate to making sure that every candidate within \ntheir boundary receives one of these forms. In theory, as they would be sending out literature \nto the candidates in any case, there should be no extra cost at all for local authorities. The cost \nwill fall on your own department. Is that the case? \n \n[26] Carl Sargeant: Frank, would you like to talk about the details? \n \n[27] Mr Cuthbert: Yes. It is slightly more complex than that, largely because, in theory, \nmost of the literature that is sent out is sent out by the returning officer and not by the local \nauthority. If we wanted the returning officer to distribute more literature, we would have to \nget involved with legislation affecting the returning officer, over which we do not have \ndevolved competence. So, the local authority would have to conduct a separate mailing to \ncandidates. We would be paying it for the cost of duplicating the questionnaire, sending it out \nwith a reply envelope and the staff time for inputting information onto a spreadsheet that we \nwould have prepared; those data would then be transferred to us.  \n \n[28] Janet Ryder: So, the bulk of the costs will fall on your department. All of the costs \nestimated, therefore, stand against your budget. \n \n[29] Carl Sargeant: Yes, but I do not believe that these will be significant costs. We are \nnot talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds to do this. This is a matter of sending \nletters out.  \n \n[30] Janet Ryder: It would mean devising and translating a questionnaire. You have put \nthose costs against your own department and you have accounted for that in your \ndepartmental budget. \n \n[31] Carl Sargeant: One form will need to be translated, and that will be shared with \neveryone.  \n \n[32] Peter Black: I do not want to get bogged down with the insignificant part of the \nproposed Measure, but many candidates would just bin this questionnaire. Will the responses \nbe chased up? \n \n[33] Carl Sargeant: It is not our intention to do that. We would have to see what the \nresponse levels are and reassess that at a later date. I hope that interested parties would take \npart in this. I cannot make people respond. That happens already.  \n \n[34] Angela Burns: Rosemary, are you happy with that line of questioning? Have you \nfinished? \n \n[35] Rosemary Butler: Yes, I think so, but I might come back to it later, if I may. \n \n[36] Angela Burns: Yes, of course. Irene, I think that you were going to tackle training \nand development. \n \n[37] Irene James: The costs of training and development are stated to be dependent on \nthe existing level of provision within authorities. What work is being done to determine the \nvariation between authorities, thus giving an indication of the funding required? For example, \nhas an assessment been undertaken of the level of need against current provision? \n \n[38] Carl Sargeant: We are always keen to understand what training is happening already \nin the field. It would be useful for the committee to know that we already provide ?110,000 \nper year to the WLGA to support training for members. Most local authorities also have their \n 7 04/11/2010 \nown training budgets. We are developing this process in line with the WLGA?s member \ndevelopment charter, which it supports. So, this is just about formalising a process that we \nalready fund anyway.  \n \n[39] Perhaps I should add that, in addition to that, we have invested over ?200,000 through \nthe scrutiny development fund over the last three years. So, again, this work is ongoing. We \nare trying to bring in and standardise levels of scrutiny and training among local authorities, \nwhich I do not think is a bad position to be in. \n \n[40] Irene James: The explanatory memorandum gives an estimate of ?5,000 for pump \npriming, and sets the cost of appraisal at ?2,500 per authority. Can you explain the basis for \nthese estimates? \n \n[41] Carl Sargeant: As I said at the beginning of the session, we are not starting from \nscratch. There are already model authorities that are delivering very good service within the \nboundaries of the funding that they get already. That is why I said that some authorities may \nhave these systems already in place; if there is a need for improvement, then that is what the \nadditional money is there for. \n \n1.20 p.m. \n \n[42] Peter Black: I have a question about the councillor annual reports. What format do \nyou envisage them taking? Clearly, the format will very much affect the cost.  \n \n[43] Carl Sargeant: Early discussions have been around single web pages. It will be a \nnon-political, very simple message, such as ?Peter Black sits on x amount of committees and \nattends x many committees? and so on. That is already a matter of record, but the information \nis not collated and accessible to the public. I think that it would just be a single web page, and \nall authorities already have those.  \n \n[44] Peter Black: Some councils already do something similar.  \n \n[45] Carl Sargeant: Absolutely, yes.  \n \n[46] Lorraine Barrett: The explanatory memorandum states that the Social Justice and \nLocal Government Department provides ?110,000 per year to the Welsh Local Government \nAssociation for training councillors, and that the local government settlement already includes \nprovision for training and development. How much is already included for this purpose within \nthe settlement? \n \n[47] Carl Sargeant: It is not hypothecated, so it is difficult to identify. The WLGA \nwelcomes that we do not hypothecate it. As we do not, and it therefore goes into the budget, it \nis difficult to identify. We can tell you how much we put in, but how much is actually spent \non training is a question that you would probably need to ask the WLGA.  \n \n[48] Lorraine Barrett: Is that something that you would ask the WLGA, to ensure that \nyou get value for that money? \n \n[49] Carl Sargeant: I always ask the WLGA whether I am getting value for money, and \nthere are several reports on the improvements and training programmes that it delivers. As I \nsaid, there is a great deal of good practice already across local authorities. This is about \nstandardisation and bringing the authorities that are not as good as others up to the expected \nthreshold of good-quality scrutiny or training for members.  \n \n[50] Lorraine Barrett: Thank you, Minister. Given that it is your intention to increase the \n 8 04/11/2010 \nlevel of training and development, and to get that level of good practice across all authorities, \ndo you think that it would be appropriate to increase the funding stream proportionately, \nrather than expecting authorities to absorb these costs? \n \n[51] Carl Sargeant: I do not believe that we are asking them to do anything they should \nnot be doing already. We are just trying to standardise that process. Of course, the WLGA and \nother bodies would ask me for more money to enhance training, but I believe that they get a \nsubstantial amount now. I gave evidence earlier about the additional ?100,000 plus that they \nget. I do not want to be prescriptive and to place too great a burden on local authorities, but \nthere is an expectation here. Authorities already sign up to the members development \ncharter?it is a WLGA document that they agree with, and that is what they should aspire to. \nAll that we are doing is placing a duty upon them in that regard.  \n \n[52] Lorraine Barrett: I will move on to the costs associated with remote attendance at \nmeetings. I do not think it means holidays in Mallorca. [Laughter.] The explanatory \nmemorandum states that the costs of remote attendance would depend upon the current \nprovision and the distribution of members. I can see that some members would be far more \nwidely distributed geographically in some areas than in others, particularly in the larger rural \nareas. What work has been done to determine the level of variability between authorities in \nterms of the current provision, and, therefore, how many are likely to require set-up funding? \nSome authorities already have webcams and video conferencing set up in their regional \noffices.  \n \n[53] Carl Sargeant: When we launched the proposed Measure, the amount of people who \nwere exercised over remote attendance and the associated costs amazed me. What we were \ntrying to do was make it easier for people, in the age of modern technology, to access council \nmeetings. I am not being prescriptive and saying that all council meetings should be web-\nbased. I am saying that it could be useful for a councillor who lives 50 miles away, for \nexample, to attend remotely. I thought that this point might come up, as it has come up in all \nthe committees that I have given evidence to on this proposed Measure. We did a little bit of \nwork on remote attendance, and I will give you one example. In Powys, a councillor \nrepresenting Welshpool has a round-trip of 81 miles to attend a meeting. That does not sound \na lot, but there is the time element as well as the driving involved. The cost saving per \nmeeting of remote attendance could be around ?40. In the long term, the more councillors do \nthat, the greater the cost saving. This is giving an opportunity, through legislation, to save \ncosts in the long term. The legislation would allow people the opportunity, legally, to hold \nmeetings using remote attendance. It makes sense to me, but people seem to be exercised over \nit. I am not saying that we should have a full suite of web-based technology in every council, \nalthough many councils have that already. It is just about giving people from different \nbackgrounds access to council meetings. \n \n[54] Lorraine Barrett: Thank you for that, but, as this is the Finance Committee, we \nshould focus on the finances and the funding. Going back to my question, what work has been \ndone to determine the level of variability and the likely set-up costs? Given that some of the \ninfrastructure is already there, have you done any work on those costs? \n \n[55] Carl Sargeant: I understand that the evidence that has been presented to you \npreviously is that it cost around ?21,000 for Cardiff Council. We are not proposing that \nauthorities go down the same route as Cardiff, although if other local authorities wish to do \nthat and make that investment, so be it. Most councils now provide authority members with \nlaptops, and, if they do not, they provide services through libraries and they provide video-\nconferencing systems in parts of the council. Most council headquarters or chambers have \nvideo-conferencing facilities. We are not starting from scratch here; we are building on what \nis there and addressing the voids in the system, although I do not think that there are an awful \nlot of them. It cost ?21,000 for webcasting Cardiff Council?s meetings, but I do not think that \n 9 04/11/2010 \nthat is what we are talking about. This is about simplifying access for a councillor somewhere \nin Wales to a council meeting and so on, and that is not a big cost. \n \n[56] Lorraine Barrett: Wrexham council also investigated the possibility of having a \nwebcasting system, and the annual cost was estimated at around ?19,000. You have come up \nwith estimated costs of ?2,000 per authority, and we just wondered what your estimates were \nbased on. You started to cover that by saying that there is some infrastructure in place \nalready. \n \n[57] Carl Sargeant: Perhaps Frank can come in on that in a second. In giving evidence in \ncommittee, we have not said?and this would be a matter for the standing orders of the \ncouncil?that there could be an entirely remotely attended committee meeting; we are saying \nthat, if some members cannot access a committee directly, then they could do that from \nWelshpool, for example. \n \n[58] Angela Burns: Can we clarify that you are talking about probably having a camera \non top of someone?s PC at home, and the feed would be streamed through the council \nnetwork to some kind of display unit either in the council chamber or committee room? You \nare talking about that level of provision, are you? \n \n[59] Carl Sargeant: Absolutely. It would be no more than that. \n \n[60] Lorraine Barrett: Okay. That is helpful. \n \n[61] Angela Burns: Peter has the next set of questions. \n \n[62] Peter Black: Moving on to democratic services?I cannot believe that I am asking \nthis question, but there we are?the explanatory memorandum states that functions to be \ncovered by the proposed democratic services department are already provided by councils. \nHowever, some respondents have expressed concern that the proposed Measure would require \nnew responsibilities that are not currently provided for, and therefore additional resources. \nHow would you respond to that, and what work has been undertaken to determine the current \nlevels of provision? \n \n[63] Carl Sargeant: We are not placing new responsibilities on councils. Many councils \nalready have a head of democratic services. We are saying that the functions should be split \nbetween the head of paid services and the head of democratic services so that there is a clear \nseparation, primarily to support council backbenchers. So, it is about that supportive process, \nso that there is no conflict of interest. It is something that we do here, and I think that it is \ngood practice. It is not a case of placing a financial burden on authorities because many \nauthorities are already doing it; it is more about tweaking what is already there, and \nredesignating a person to operate as a head of democratic services. \n \n1.30 p.m. \n \n[64] Peter Black: Given that the responsibilities already exist and that all that most \ncouncils will be doing is just tweaking, how do you come to a figure of ?12,500 per council \nper annum?  \n \n[65] Mr Cuthbert: We based that on an estimate of the cost if an authority has to \nestablish a new or additional committee and requires part of the time of a committee clerk or \nclerks to run it. That could be the approximate cost of the committee?s creation over a year. I \nhave heard arguments that the head of democratic services would have to be a new person \nbrought into the council, but we are not proposing that at all, as that would be an expensive \nexercise. It would be similar to what happened when monitoring officers were introduced in \n 10 04/11/2010 \nthe Local Government and Housing Act 1989: usually, an existing officer was designated as \nthe monitoring officer, and that is what we are proposing in this case as well.  \n \n[66] Peter Black: The explanatory memorandum states that only Gwynedd and Powys \nauthorities are currently operating the alternative arrangements. However, I thought that \nWrexham and Merthyr were also doing so. I am sure that Merthyr is. \n \n[67] Mr Cuthbert: Merthyr has jumped ship and adopted executive arrangements from \nearlier on this year. Wrexham has not operated alternative arrangements, but has established a \npolitically balanced executive.  \n \n[68] Peter Black: Right, fair enough. You estimate that if Gwynedd and Powys \nauthorities were to choose to change to the mayor and cabinet model the associated costs, \nincluding a referendum, would be between ?80,000 and ?400,000, depending on size. What \ndiscussions have you had with these authorities regarding how likely it would be that they \nwould choose this model over the leader and cabinet option? \n \n[69] Carl Sargeant: It would perhaps not be appropriate for me to discuss the issues \naround those two authorities, because I, ultimately, would make the decision as to whether it \nis appropriate for them to change or not. We have, hopefully, provided you with estimates of \nthe cost should the authorities pursue that programme. With regard to Gwynedd, we have \nevidence that the cost could be around ?175,000 to ?200,000 if that was the route that it took, \nand that is based on the cost of printing ballot papers, and so on.  \n \n[70] Peter Black: Are you proposing a formal referendum, because the previous \narrangement was an extensive consultation exercise, was it not?  \n \n[71] Carl Sargeant: That would be the route for the mayoral system.  \n \n[72] Peter Black: It would not try to go to a cabinet model, as opposed to a mayoral \nsystem?  \n \n[73] Carl Sargeant: There would be no costs involved there. \n \n[74] Mr Cuthbert: Well, there would be small administrative costs.  \n \n[75] Carl Sargeant: It would be a minimal cost, and that is what Merthyr has done.  \n \n[76] Peter Black: In terms of this extra cost, would you be proposing to provide this \nmoney or are authorities expected to meet the cost from their own resources?  \n \n[77] Carl Sargeant: We have not paid those costs in the past. The only time that this has \never been explored was in relation to Ceredigion. I believe that the council paid the cost of \nthat decision-making process itself. I would not want to interfere in the decision-making \nprocess of a council in any case.  \n \n[78] Peter Black: The explanatory memorandum states that simplifying the procedure for \nan authority to change its executive arrangements may result in a small potential cost saving. \nHas any work been undertaken to estimate how much of a saving this may be? \n \n[79] Carl Sargeant: It would be minimal. An estimate has been made, and it is a very low \ncost saving, but it is a cost saving. They are minimal cost savings and we have worked those \nfigures up, so I would not want to shout from the rooftops about them.   \n \n[80] Nick Ramsay: I want to ask you about scrutiny arrangements. With reference to the \n 11 04/11/2010 \nformation of joint scrutiny committees, evidence to Legislation Committee No. 3 suggests \nthat the costs in the explanatory memorandum provide for structural changes only and do not \ninclude the resource implications of support and capacity building, which would be required. \nCould you explain more about what the estimates were based on and what they are intended \nto cover?  \n \n[81] Carl Sargeant: It is not always the case that we are expecting a new committee to be \nestablished for scrutiny purposes. We believe that, in terms of joint scrutiny, there would \nalready be committees in place in various authorities, and it would be a case of bringing them \ntogether under some sort of host authorities?in fact, you should get cost savings from that. \nWe do not believe that it is a big upheaval. We are not saying that another committee should \nbe created; we are saying that two or more existing committees should be brought together. \nThere is potential there. That already happens with Newport, Monmouthshire and Cardiff, as \nwell as Swansea, and there are good examples of it working well, with minimal costs. We \nhave included a figure just in case there were additional costs, but? \n \n[82] Nick Ramsay: Is that the cost of holding a joint committee? \n \n[83] Carl Sargeant: It is the cost of establishing a joint committee. \n \n[84] Nick Ramsay: What about the savings from a joint committee? What do you \nestimate for that? \n \n[85] Carl Sargeant: Again, we have to work that out in practice, looking at the scale and \nthe size of these joint committees. We are providing the legislation to create them; we just \nneed to understand what they will scrutinise, and how many people will do it. It is a case of, \n?How long is a piece of string?? We recognise that, by bringing two committees together, \nthere are potential savings, but the possibilities are endless. In north Wales, for example, you \ncould have six authorities scrutinising a body, so the cost savings there could be different. \nThere is also the possibility of remote attendance, which complicates things ever so slightly.  \n \n[86] Angela Burns: I expect that people at Microsoft are rubbing their hands with glee as \nwe speak. \n \n[87] Nick Ramsay: I am not sure about remote attendance, but there we are. You \nmentioned north Wales, and we have had evidence from Gwynedd Council that suggests that \nthe cost for a scrutiny committee meeting five times a year is ?27,000, and therefore your \n?5,000 estimate is way off the mark. How would you respond to that? \n \n[88] Carl Sargeant: I understand Gwynedd?s concerns, because of the size of that \ncouncil, but there are proposals for remote attendance as well as current examples, in \nNewport, Monmouthshire and Swansea, and so on, of authorities that are already doing this. \nWe have not seen any real-terms additional costs in delivering this service. Gwynedd may not \nlike our figures, but its own are also difficult; I will leave it at that. \n \n[89] Janet Ryder: The areas that you cite as examples tend to be urban areas, do they not? \nGwynedd is very rural. Taking the analogy that you gave at the beginning about joint scrutiny \namong the six north Wales authorities, if councillors were to attend remotely?apart from \nthose at the host authority, and, even in that case, if only the councillors living closest to \nwhere the meeting is held attend in person?there would be no cost if the technology were set \nup already, but, in reality, they would probably travel, and the travel costs from the farthest \npart of Gwynedd or Flintshire into, say, Colwyn Bay, would have to be included in your \ncalculation. Have you estimated the remuneration costs and taken them into account? \n \n[90] Carl Sargeant: We know what the costs would be if someone decided to travel, but I \n 12 04/11/2010 \ncannot tell you where they will travel to. \n \n[91] Janet Ryder: So, you have not made any estimates of that kind. \n \n[92] Carl Sargeant: Our estimate of ?5,000 is based on the assumption that this is not too \nonerous a task. I accept that there are issues around demography, people?s locations and the \naccess points to local authorities, but I do not see that as something that cannot be dealt with, \neither technologically or otherwise. Conwy and Denbighshire already have joint scrutiny \ncommittees, and there are other examples. I do not see Gwynedd as being isolated. \n \n[93] Janet Ryder: I was just giving Gwynedd as an example and trying to get at whether \nyou have estimated the costs. There are joint committees in north Wales that would incur \ntravelling and other associated costs, and you could use them to draw an analogy. Have you \nestimated against any such examples as to what the costs might be? \n \n[94] Carl Sargeant: Have we done that? I do not think that we have, no. \n \n1.40 p.m. \n \n[95] Mr Cuthbert: If we were talking about the creation of a new committee from scratch \nthat needed to employ its clerical staff, and it was to be run in addition to anything that local \nauthorities already have, Gwynedd?s costs might be realistic. I imagine, from looking at them, \nthat they probably include travel allowances and other allowances to councillors for attending \nthose meetings. We should remember that we are enabling local authorities to establish joint \ncommittees. We are not telling them to set them up. For every time that they would be setting \nup a new committee to look at a fresh issue, there would be another case where they would, in \neffect, be removing the work of two other committees that were operating in two \nneighbouring authorities. So, it is difficult to cost. My suspicion is that it is cost-neutral \noverall. \n \n[96] Carl Sargeant: To pick up a point on Gwynedd?s figure of ?27,000, I would expect \nthat if that is what it is currently paying, this will not be an additional burden. It must have \ncosted the running a scrutiny committee at ?27,000. We are saying that the opportunity to \nhave joint scrutiny with another authority could potentially reduce the costs for the other \nauthority and for Gwynedd, depending on where it was hosted. \n \n[97] Nick Ramsay: On the wider issue of the cost to the third sector, we have received \nevidence from the Welsh Council for Voluntary Action, Stonewall Cymru and the Powys \nAssociation for Voluntary Organisations, which believe that the resource implications for the \nthird sector for the wider public scrutiny part of the proposed Measure have not been \nadequately taken into account. Do you have any response to that and the question of where \nthe resourcing for the third sector might come from? \n \n[98] Carl Sargeant: We are in a time when I rarely meet representatives of organisations \nwho do not say, ?It?s going to be a difficult settlement and we?re going to be struggling for \nmoney. Have you got any more money?? The reality is that we do not. By introducing the \nproposed Measure, we are trying to present opportunities in legislation for public bodies and \nthe third sector to engage with each other in a better and, hopefully, cheaper way. On the \nissues around the scrutiny of public bodies, we believe that if that scrutiny is split between \nthem, the costs will be negligible. We do not believe that the figures are that large. \n \n[99] Angela Burns: Janet, are you happy to take on the questions about audit? \n \n[100] Janet Ryder: Yes, I will take those questions. Minister, you have already said that \nyou are looking at a cost of some ?5,000 per authority for establishing a new committee. On \n 13 04/11/2010 \nthe establishment of audit committees, have you made any estimate of how many authorities \nalready have an audit committee in place and would therefore save that ?5,000? \n \n[101] Carl Sargeant: I am not sure whether we have the detail on that with us. We will \nhave tested which authorities are already operating this audit scheme. If we do not have those \nnumbers today, we can give them to you later. However, as you recognised, there are \nauthorities that already have audit committees, and we are following the Chartered Institute of \nPublic Finance and Accountancy guidelines on audit. It is good practice, and most local \nauthorities are already doing that. However, I can give you a note on the numbers. \n \n[102] Janet Ryder: Have you asked those that have audit committees for estimates of the \nyearly costs of servicing them? \n \n[103] Carl Sargeant: I am not sure. \n \n[104] Mr Cuthbert: No, we have not done that. We have used the same basis to \napproximate the cost of operating an audit committee as we did for previous examples of \noperating committees. I would add that I have the advantage of working with the independent \nremuneration panel as part of the administrative support for that. I know that, as part of its \nbackground work, it has been looking at what would be appropriate allowances to be paid to \nchairs of audit committees. It asked each authority whether it had an audit committee. I \ncannot remember the precise number now, although we will provide that information, but the \noverwhelming majority have some form of audit committee. \n \n[105] Janet Ryder: I think that the thrust of this is good practice in local government, and \nhaving an audit committee is good practice. We are just trying to tease out the costs that \nmight be associated with this. \n \n[106] Carl Sargeant: Again, these will not be new costs because the committees are \nalready in existence?these costs are not additional. I think that more than half already have \nthese committees. We can give you the numbers. So, the costs will be minimal because the \ncommittees are already in operation. That why I started by saying what I did about the costs \nas they have been presented and how it would be a different matter if we had been starting \nwith a blank sheet of paper, but we are clearly not.  \n \n[107] Janet Ryder: Moving on to look at community councils with regard to reviewing \ncommunity areas, it is already a duty, but you state that some have avoided carrying out that \nduty perhaps by relying on the local government boundary commission to undertake a review \non their behalf. Is it intended that this duty will encourage all authorities to conduct their own \nreviews or to rely on the commission to do so and then pay a subsequent charge to the \ncommission? \n \n[108] Carl Sargeant: Some clever treasurers have perhaps seen the slight loophole that \nmeans that, if they ask the boundary commission to do this work for them, the boundary \ncommission pays for it. In fact, there is a duty on authorities to do this already. Therefore, we \nare closing the loophole. \n \n[109] Janet Ryder: So, do you expect them to carry the cost themselves? \n \n[110] Carl Sargeant: Yes, as they should already be doing. \n \n[111] Janet Ryder: You have given quite a range of estimated costs for carrying out those \nreviews. How will the charge to the authority be calculated if the commission continues to \nconduct the reviews on its behalf? Is there a mechanism for that? \n \n 14 04/11/2010 \n[112] Carl Sargeant: I think that the commission is best placed to calculate those charges. \nThat is what it is doing already if it is doing the job for authorities. It obviously charges them \nnow for doing that job. Why would an authority ask the boundary commission if it was not \ngetting a bargain? [Laughter.]  \n \n[113] Janet Ryder: Cynicism, Minister. \n \n[114] Angela Burns: We will write to the boundary commission to ask it to clarify that \npoint for us. \n \n[115] Janet Ryder: The grant paid to the commission for 2010 was ?615,500. Will the \ncommission receive a reduction in its funding to reflect the reimbursement of the costs of \nthese reviews if local authorities undertake them themselves? \n \n[116] Carl Sargeant: I have not considered that yet, but it will be at the forefront of my \nmind. \n \n[117] Mr Cuthbert: Perhaps I could add that the boundary commission is funded from the \nmoney that it draws down from us. So, it gets the money that it spends. If it gets income, it \ncan draw down less because it has received income from elsewhere. So, it is fairly watertight, \nunless it is fiddling the books, which it would never do. [Laughter.] \n \n[118] Angela Burns: I would hope not. Janet, you are on a roll here. \n \n[119] Janet Ryder: Looking at the power of wellbeing that is to be conferred on \ncommunity councils, the explanatory memorandum says that it would be for the council to \nconsider any financial implications when deciding to use the power. A number of councils \nhave responded expressing concern that it would result in their having to provide an increased \nlevel of services without any corresponding increase in resources. Can you clarify the \nintention with regard to this power? Is it expected that community councils should increase \ntheir level of service provision as a result of this? If so, how are they expected to fund this? \n \n[120] Carl Sargeant: To be clear, there is no expectation that the power of wellbeing will \nresult in an increase in the duties placed on town and community councils. This is clearly a \nmatter for discussion between the local authorities and the town and community councils with \nregard to their expectations. We are enhancing their role and their opportunities to develop, \nbut we are not stipulating a duty to do this. This is an opportunity as opposed to a directive. \n \n1.50 p.m. \n \n[121] Janet Ryder: Regarding the Welsh Government?s ability to award grants to \ncommunity councils, could that be used as a mechanism to fund any resulting increase in \nservices? \n \n[122] Carl Sargeant: At the moment, we are not able to grant-fund town and community \ncouncils. This gives us a mechanism to do that, should we feel the need to do so in the future. \n \n[123] Janet Ryder: I wish to clarify something. Would there ever be circumstances in \nwhich you might offer a grant to supplement a service for which rates were already being \ncollected but where the county council perceived a shortfall?  \n \n[124] Carl Sargeant: I would not do that. This is about who delivers what service, and \nwhere. This would give us the mechanism to grant-fund a town or community council that \nwas delivering a service. \n \n 15 04/11/2010 \n[125] Mr Phipps: It is probably worth noting that a similar power already exists in relation \nto principal councils. I think that it exists under the Local Government Act 2003. So, seeking \nthis power is a prudent step, in the context of the proposed Measure. \n \n[126] Peter Black: I want to ask something in relation to this. I stand to be corrected if I \nhave misunderstood the local government finance system, which is very easy to do, I must \nsay. My understanding is that, when calculating the cap, any council tax levied by a \ncommunity council is added to what the principal council levies. If you calculate it at 5 per \ncent, for example, you would take what the community councils have levied into account as \npart of the calculation. I may be oversimplifying a very complicated matter. \n \n[127] Mr Phipps: I would defer to my local government finance colleagues if they were \nhere. I suspect that that is not the case, actually. I do not believe that the community council \nelement counts. However, we will probably need to confirm that. \n \n[128] Peter Black: My question is this. If you gave the community councils powers over \nwellbeing, and they decided to fund the use of those powers by putting up the council tax, \nwhich they would be entitled to do, would that have any impact on decisions relating to \ncapping the principal council, if that expenditure was taken into account as part of that \ncouncil area? \n \n[129] Carl Sargeant: Would they not be prevented from capping themselves? Perhaps I \ncan write a note to the Chair on that detail. \n \n[130] Janet Ryder: In relation to grant-making powers, the WLGA has expressed concern \nthat they would remove funding from elsewhere. The explanatory memorandum states that \nthere will be no additional cost associated with grant funding, which suggests that it is to be \nfound from another source. If that is the case, how much funding do you envisage being \ndelivered via grants to community councils, and from where would that be found? \n \n[131] Carl Sargeant: The WLGA would say that, would it not? We are not proposing that \nduties should be forced on town and community councils now, but we are making the \nprovision to do so and the ability to grant-fund them should that be needed. I am not one for \nthe principle of duplicated funding, and I do not think that any future Minister would be \neither. It is a bad place to be. If a local authority is doing a duty and a town or community \ncouncil is doing the same duty, why would we fund them both? It is an either/or situation. The \nWLGA may have a valid point in asking, ?If they are doing that job now, where does the \nmoney come from?? However, that is obvious to me, and I am not proposing that a duty \nshould be moved from one or the other. We are just making the provision. The dialogue \nbetween the two is about how the duty of service delivery in an authority area should be \norganised. It is not a decision for me. At the moment, we are unable to grant-fund them, but \nwe will not be if these powers are included. \n \n[132] Angela Burns: Why would you seek to do that? Is it because you foresee a situation \nin which you have a concern that a council is not delivering something, or is this a result of a \npolicy decision, and you want community councils to be more involved in a particular aspect \nof the democratic process? \n \n[133] Carl Sargeant: Local democracy might indicate that a local town or community \ncouncil could provide a better grass-cutting service than the local authority. \n \n[134] Angela Burns: Absolutely. \n \n[135] Carl Sargeant: Therefore, the transfer of appropriate funding would be at that level. \nAt the moment, we are unable to do that, but this will provide us with a mechanism to do it. \n 16 04/11/2010 \nThat is not a discussion that I want to be involved in; it would purely be a local decision. \n \n[136] Angela Burns: Does it provide a mechanism for a community council to get the \ncounty council to agree? I am trying to understand whether there is a cost involved if a \ncommunity council said that, under this, it was allowed to do its own grass-cutting, and asked \nthe county council for that bit of the money that it would otherwise spend on it. Who would \nnegotiate that if the county council said ?no?, because it did not want the community council \nto do that? I do not quite get that. \n \n[137] Carl Sargeant: That would be a local decision between the two bodies. The \nwellbeing power enables there to be discussions between the two bodies. The decision over \nwho does it will require a democratic discussion between the authorities. \n \n[138] Angela Burns: My point is that, if they do not agree, is there a cost to having some \nkind of arbitrator? \n \n[139] Carl Sargeant: I am not sure. I do not know whether we? \n \n[140] Mr Phipps: If there were no agreement and the community council wanted to \nproceed and do that grass-cutting, it would have to determine how it would fund it. The \nobvious place for it to start is the precept and its existing resources. As the Minister says? \n \n[141] Angela Burns: I am not trying to be awkward. The reason why I ask this question is \nbecause I have seen that community councils and county councils do not always have the \nwarmest of relationships, and I can quite see the case for a community council to bring back \nsome stuff to its area and be in control of it. We are all talking about the localism agenda, \nwhich is extremely important. Will a mechanism be put into place to enable arbitration, as I \nhave not picked that up in this proposed Measure? Thinking about my area, the breakdown in \nthe relationship is such that we would need an arbitrator to pull that through, and that must \nhave an ongoing cost. \n \n[142] Carl Sargeant: If we look at it in reverse, as opposed to how you presented it, we \ncan see that it is about who has the duty now. I can think of many town and community \ncouncils that would say that they should be doing something, and that, because there is a cost \nelement to it, if they got the finances for it, they would do a better job. That has always been \nthe argument. The issue here is who is actually doing that job. The duty is within local \nauthorities. The proposed Measure presents an opportunity for town and community councils. \nIf a local authority was happy for a town and community council to do the grass-cutting, we \nwould just pass that process on. The funding element would probably come from the local \nauthority or through the precept. I do not envisage any need for us to be arbitrators in the case \nof a strong town and community council saying to a local authority, ?We want to do the grass-\ncutting but you will not let us?, because that is not how the process works. The ownership is \nwith the local authority and then it is transferred to a town and community council. \n \n[143] Angela Burns: Thank you for the clarification. I think that we are now back to Janet, \nor have we covered your questions? We may well have done with you. \n \n[144] Janet Ryder: I am looking at the charters and the accreditation scheme. The \nexplanatory memorandum states that there are no costs associated with the reserve powers in \nrelation to charters and an accreditation scheme for community councils, and that such a \npower may not need to be used if a voluntary scheme is successful. What would be the costs \nassociated with the voluntary arrangements? \n \n[145] Carl Sargeant: Agreeing the charter and implementing the resulting action plan is all \nabout engagement and collaboration in the process. We do not believe that the accreditation \n 17 04/11/2010 \nscheme for community councils is a pre-requisite for agreeing charters, or for community \ncouncils? voluntary participation in training courses. At the moment, a voluntary accreditation \nscheme may evolve out of that process, and we do not currently believe that there will be a \ncost involved. It is just a process, really. \n \n[146] Janet Ryder: So, when will you determine whether the voluntary arrangements have \nbeen satisfactory, and therefore whether these reserve powers will be used? \n \n2.00 p.m. \n \n[147] Mr Phipps: It is important to separate the charters from the accreditation scheme. \nThere is not necessarily a connection between those two. I suppose that charters are an \nexample of best practice in which local authorities and community councils should be \nengaging. They should be communicating and working effectively together. We are already \nworking with councils, the WLGA and One Voice Wales on the voluntary adoption of \ncharters, and authorities are generally making good progress on that. It is difficult to set a \ntimescale on when we would look to intervene with statutory powers. If, for example, the \nprincipal authority and the town and community councils in its area were happy that the \narrangements were in place, even though they do not have a piece of paper that says ?charter? \non it, I suspect that Ministers would probably not want to intervene. However, if we receive \nstrong representations that one party or another is not engaging in the process or with the \nother party, a Minister may consider using the powers in that situation?but that would be \nindividually, and not necessarily as a blanket approach to statutory charters across Wales. \n \n[148] Janet Ryder: So, does that go some way towards answering the question that was \nput? \n \n[149] Mr Phipps: Possibly, although I do not think that the Minister could use the charter \npowers to drive a delegation of services, rather to ensure that there is a proper debate about \nthe issues. \n \n[150] Angela Burns: Minister, I am conscious of the time, but there are still a few \nquestions that we want to ask on the payment and pensions section. Are you happy to stay \nwith us for another five minutes? \n \n[151] Carl Sargeant: I probably have five minutes before I have to leave for Merthyr \nTydfil. \n \n[152] Angela Burns: Okay. Andrew, I ask you to be snappy with your questions. \n \n[153] Andrew Davies: I will certainly try. My questions are on the function of the \nindependent remuneration panel. The proposal is for its budget to be ?50,000 going forward, \nwhich is an increase of ?20,000. How did you arrive at that estimate, given that the IRP?s \nbudget was actually reduced by ?20,000 in the 2009-10 financial year? \n \n[154] Carl Sargeant: The remit and duties of the IRP will be increased in line with an \nexpectation of delivery. It will now be discussing national park authorities, fire and rescue \nauthorities and town and community councils as well, so that increase is based on the research \nelement and the uplift in the knowledge base that it will need to deliver that service. \n \n[155] Andrew Davies: Have you looked at the functioning of the IRP and its operation, or \nis the increase in its remit just to cover the town and community councils, national park \nauthorities and fire and rescue authorities? \n \n[156] Carl Sargeant: Its function is a decision for the IRP, but we believe that the \n 18 04/11/2010 \nadditional work that it will have to carry out will have cost implications of an additional \n?20,000.  \n \n[157] Andrew Davies: So, it is purely extending the remit. \n \n[158] Carl Sargeant: Yes. \n \n[159] Andrew Davies: My next question is on the financial implications for local \nauthorities. Some local authorities have given evidence that the IRP?s decisions could have a \nsignificant impact on their budgets. How will the IRP go about deciding the level of \nallowances, given that some local authorities may make the decision to go up to the \nmaximum? \n \n[160] Carl Sargeant: It already has that discretion. We are having a similar discussion in \nthe Assembly about levels of remuneration and so on. It is appropriate for an external body to \nbe doing that, and the IRP is the body to do that. I expect it to consider the additional costs for \nlocal authorities, fire authorities and so on, and their implications. So, I expect it to have that \nin mind when it makes those decisions. I also expect that the additional costs that some of the \nauthorities are concerned about, such as the administration support and member support, will \nbe minimal. It is a highly controversial process, so there is a need for it to be delivered in a \ntransparent way, and the IRP is the body to do that. \n \n[161] Andrew Davies: This is my last question, and I hope that it is snappy enough. \n[Laughter.] What is the difference between an allowance and a salary? I have always been \nintrigued by that. \n \n[162] Carl Sargeant: That is a technical issue that I will ask my colleagues to address. My \nunderstanding, which is based purely on my local knowledge, as opposed to any technical \ndetail, is that the difference is based on tax issues. Perhaps I can give you some more detail in \nwriting, Andrew.  \n \n[163] Peter Black: Chair, may I ask something quickly? Will the IRP in future be \nrecommending maximum allowances and giving local authorities the discretion to pay less \nthan that, or will it be recommending a standard allowance across Wales, which the authority \nwill not have the discretion to vary? \n \n[164] Carl Sargeant: My understanding is that we will be looking at a maximum \nallowance. This is something that I would advise, but the remuneration panel is independent. \nFrom your question, I glean that you are asking whether a fixed amount should be designated \nfor all councils. \n \n[165] Peter Black: What I am getting at is that, if a maximum allowance is set and \nauthorities are given discretion, the sort of extra costs to go up to the maximum that Gwynedd \nhas indicated?some ?300,000?would be a matter for the council as it would not have been \nimposed on it. \n \n[166] Carl Sargeant: As is now the case in the Assembly, if you do not wish to take your \nfull salary, you do not have to do so. \n \n[167] Peter Black: However, the authority can determine that, for all councillors, the \nallowance would be less than the recommended level. \n \n[168] Mr Cuthbert: The proposed Measure will give the panel the power to make that \nchoice. It will be able to do as it is doing at the moment?that is, imposing maximums?or, if \nit so wishes, it will be able to set the amounts that councillors must be paid. There will still be \n 19 04/11/2010 \na provision enabling an individual councillor to give up some or all of his or her allowances, \nbut the panel will be able to make that choice. That is why there are new provisions about the \npanel needing to consult before making its decisions and a fallback power for the Minister to \nask it to think again, if it seems to be proposing something that is unreasonable. \n \n[169] Peter Black: However, you understand that if the IRP opts to set a recommended \nlevel that cannot be varied, it has implications for your explanatory memorandum with regard \nto the costs of this proposed Measure. Councils that are paying less than the maximum will be \nforced to raise their payments to the maximum. \n \n[170] Carl Sargeant: I understand your question about self-determination; should the local \ncouncil wish to pay a lower rate than the level that the IRP sets, then it can do so.  \n \n[171] Peter Black: That is my point. \n \n[172] Carl Sargeant: I am not saying that if the IRP says that it should be set at ?500, then \nyou will have ?500. It will be up to the discretion of the local authority. \n \n[173] Peter Black: Do you mean the council as opposed to the councillor? \n \n[174] Carl Sargeant: Yes. \n \n[175] Peter Black: That is quite important in terms of the costings. \n \n[176] Angela Burns: I am going to draw this meeting to a close. Thank you very much for \nyour time today. We will write to you later this week to ask you for further information on the \npoints that you have made today. \n \n[177] Carl Sargeant: Thank you very much, and if there are any points on which you need \nclarification, please write to us and we will be happy to give you some more figures if that is \nappropriate. \n \n[178] Janet Ryder: [Inaudible.] \n \n[179] Carl Sargeant: Yes, we have made a note of that and we will forward that \ninformation. \n \n[180] Angela Burns: I thank you and your team very much indeed, Minister. \n \n2.08 p.m. \n \nCynnig Trefniadol \nProcedural Motion \n \n[181] Angela Burns: I move that \n \nthe committee resolves to exclude the public from part of the meeting in accordance with \nStanding Order No. 10.37. \n \n[182] I see that the committee is in agreement.  \n \nDerbyniwyd y cynnig. \nMotion agreed. \n \n 20 04/11/2010 \nGohiriwyd y cyfarfod cyhoeddus rhwng 2.08 p.m. a 2.34 p.m. \nThe public part of the meeting was adjourned between 2.08 p.m. and 2.34 p.m.  \n \nGoblygiadau Ariannol y Mesur Arfaethedig ynghylch Diogelwch ar Gludiant i \nDdysgwyr (Cymru) ?Tystiolaeth gan y Dirprwy Brif Weinidog \nFinancial Implications of the Proposed Safety on Learner Transport (Wales) \nMeasure ?Evidence from the Deputy First Minister \n \n[183] Angela Burns: Deputy First Minister, I welcome you to this evidence session. For \nthe record, please introduce your colleagues. \n \n[184] The Deputy First Minister: On my left is James Price, and on my right is Bethan \nBateman. They are both from the transport department.  \n \n[185] Angela Burns: Thank you. Deputy First Minister, would you like to make any \nopening comments? \n \n[186] The Deputy First Minister: No. \n \n[187] Angela Burns: In that case, we will go straight into questions. Nick, would you like \nto start? \n \n[188] Nick Ramsay: Good afternoon, Deputy First Minister. What work have you \nundertaken to assess the expenditure that will result from the proposed Measure? \n \n[189] The Deputy First Minister: A survey was undertaken by the local government data \nunit in conjunction with our statistical directorate to give us a better idea of the costs of \nimplementing our proposals. It provided us with a range of data on the age and specification \nof the vehicles used to provide dedicated learner transport in Wales. This information has \nbeen used to assess expenditure. However, of course, when we get to the point where some of \nthe proposals need to be developed further in light of the regulations that we would introduce, \nwe would try to firm it up a lot more. \n \n[190] Nick Ramsay: Have you made an assessment of the impact of the expenditure on \nexisting budgets? Are there any particular Assembly Government budgets, in addition to your \ndepartment?s budget, that you think might be affected? \n \n[191] The Deputy First Minister: I do not suppose that any other Assembly Government \nbudget would be affected, but we have obviously undertaken an assessment of my budget. As \nyou will realise, that has been a bit of a process this year in view of the fact that we had a late \ncomprehensive spending review settlement. However, we have had an opportunity to discuss \nit and I have discussed it with my officials. \n \n[192] Nick Ramsay: It may not come as much of a surprise to you, but in written evidence \nto Legislation Committee No. 4, the Welsh Local Government Association said: \n \n[193] ?The Assembly Government has stated that they will provide ?additional financial \nsupport towards the introduction of specific safety features? and this funding will be provided \nby them subject to available resources. This does not provide local authorities with a \nsufficient guarantee of funding to enable them to implement the Measure.? \n \n[194] How do you respond to these concerns? \n \n[195] The Deputy First Minister: I am not surprised by that observation, I suppose. \n 21 04/11/2010 \nHowever, I would say that we have carried out an initial assessment on the basis of the work \nthat we have done. As part of making the regulations, we would consult more widely and firm \nup those particular costings. Obviously, we understand the impact of the proposals on local \nauthorities and contractors. Rather than introduce all of the changes all at once in one year, \nwe would phase in the introduction of our requirements with regard to bus specification over \na period of time. That would spread the cost over a number of years, rather than it happening \nin one particular year. The other consideration that we need to bear in mind is that we would \nnot interfere with existing local authority contracts. We would wait until the end of a local \nauthority contract before introducing the specifications. \n \n[196] Nick Ramsay: That is the next matter that I was going to ask you about. With regard \nto the phasing in of these requirements, which I think you mentioned in the explanatory \nmemorandum, do you have an overall timetable that tells you when individual contracts are to \nbe renewed? What assessment has been made to identify in which years the costs will fall? \n \n[197] The Deputy First Minister: Obviously, there will be differences because each local \nauthority will have a different time frame for its contracts. So, we will need to bear that in \nmind. We will work with local authorities within the time frame they have allocated to their \ncontracts in order to ensure that the burden does not fall in the lifetime of an existing contract, \nbut at the point of renewal, subject to the fact that there will be different time frames for each \nof our specifications. However, the likelihood is that if, for example, a bus operator was to \nfind that it would be more cost-effective to buy a new vehicle, it would probably meet all of \nthe specifications at once, which would reduce the cost to them in relation to the other \nrequirements that we might specify. \n \n2.40 p.m. \n \n[198] Nick Ramsay: Have you started your discussions with local authorities with regard \nto the contracts? \n \n[199] The Deputy First Minister: Not in detail. Due to the time constraints, we intend to \nintroduce a number of proposals via regulation. I have told the legislation committee, \nhowever, that I am looking at possible opportunities for introducing the requirement on seat \nbelts on the face of the proposed Measure. If we were able to do that?and it is a big ?if? \nbecause of the time frame?we would need to consult local authorities and bus operators, and \nwe would need to have a firmer costing of the requirement. So, if we were able to introduce it \non the face of the proposed Measure, we would start consulting and firming up the figures. \nWe currently have some broad figures, but we would need to do a lot more work to firm them \nup. \n \n[200] Angela Burns: Rosemary, I believe that you wish to ask some questions on types of \nvehicles. \n \n[201] Rosemary Butler: Yes, I have a number of questions on the vehicles themselves. \nThe explanatory memorandum states that the cost of fitting seat belts to a 70-seat vehicle is \nabout ?11,000. Will you explain how this estimate was calculated? It also states that a \nsignificant number of buses may be in operation on school contracts that are not suitable for \nthe fitting of seat belts. What would happen if it is not possible to fit seat belts in a significant \nnumber of buses, and would there be any costs associated with that? \n \n[202] The Deputy First Minister: I will deal first with the issue of costings. We consulted \nthe industry, and by that I mean the Confederation of Passenger Transport, in order to \ncalculate those costs. If we were able to introduce that particular specification on the face of \nthe proposed Measure, we would carry out more consultation to ensure that the costings were \nabsolutely right at that point. \n 22 04/11/2010 \n \n[203] If you look again at the explanatory memorandum, you will find figures showing the \nnumber of buses that do not have seat belts. It is a pretty small proportion of the current fleet. \nOur understanding is that, even taking the number of cases that are ?not known? into account, \nthere are 2,894 vehicles that currently have seat belts, out of a total of 3,295. So, a relatively \nsmall proportion of vehicles do not have seat belts. Most coaches constructed after 2001 have \nseat belts. The question is: how many coaches or buses constructed prior to that do not have \nthem? There are various issues regarding whether or not you could retrofit them in vehicles \nbuilt before 2001. Bethan may be able to expand on that. However, the reality is that if we \nwere to impose this requirement, we would be talking about a relatively small number of \nbuses that do not have seat belts. It may well be that the cost of fitting them in an old bus \nwould be greater than the value of the vehicle, and it may be considered that the most \nappropriate thing to do is to replace the vehicle. \n \n[204] Rosemary Butler: According to the information that I have, two thirds of the learner \ntransport stock may have been manufactured before 2001. \n \n[205] The Deputy First Minister: I am not sure about that. However, I can say that the \nnumber of vehicles that do not have seat belts is relatively low. Perhaps Bethan can explain \nmore fully the difficulty of retrofitting seat belts in older vehicles. \n \n[206] Ms Bateman: We should make a distinction between buses and coaches because the \nrequirements are quite different. It would be difficult to retrofit some buses because the floor \nstrength of the vehicle would mean that the costs would be prohibitive. You would therefore \nwant to replace them. It is possible to retrofit older or newer coaches, however, because those \nvehicles were built to stronger standards. In terms of knowing whether we have large numbers \nof older coaches or buses out there, we have spoken to the industry, and the feeling seems to \nbe that most of the vehicles are older coaches, so they could be retrofitted in instances where \nseat belts were not fitted originally. It therefore looks like the number of buses out there that \ncannot be retrofitted is quite low. The other thing to say about retrofitting is that, once a \nvehicle has been retrofitted, another certificate of initial fitness must be applied for to ensure \nthat it is roadworthy. Therefore, safety checks are built into the process. \n \n[207] Rosemary Butler: It might be helpful, Chair, if we could have those figures. I am a \nbit confused about the numbers. You are saying that you do not think that there are many, but \nthat there could be. \n \n[208] The Deputy First Minister: The actual figures relating to the vehicles are in the \nexplanatory memorandum. \n \n[209] Angela Burns: A total of 141 have been identified as not having seat belts fitted. \n \n[210] The Deputy First Minister: That is right. \n \n[211] Angela Burns: My question relates to the 260 ?unknown? buses. Why do we not \nknow about them? Do the local authorities not have to keep a record? Surely they are \nresponsible for carrying out the safety checks, or checking that the bus companies do so? I am \nnot entirely clear on that point. \n \n[212] Ms Bateman: We obtained the data by surveying each of the 22 local authorities and \nencouraged them to give the fullest return. Unfortunately, the response that we got on some \naspects of the bus fleet was ?unknown?. \n \n[213] The Deputy First Minister: At the point at which the regulation would be made, we \nwould be in a position where, by law, we would need to know. Therefore, we could firm up \n 23 04/11/2010 \nall the figures so that all the figures in the ?not known? column would go into the ?known? \ncolumn.  \n \n[214] Angela Burns: I am slightly concerned that the local authorities either do not wish to \nshare their information or do not know.  \n \n[215] The Deputy First Minister: I think that they probably know, but are currently not \nsharing. \n \n[216] Peter Black: You are far more optimistic than I am on that, Deputy First Minister.  \n \n[217] This morning, we had a technical discussion about seat belts and the law relating to \nthem. You told the committee that you could not make any legislation regarding the type of \nseatbelts and so on that could be fitted. However, as regards the risk assessment, a local \nauthority may wish to fit age-appropriate seat belts. In the costings, have you taken account of \nthe number of age-appropriate seatbelts?for under 14 year olds?that might need to be fitted \non buses that have already been fitted with adult seat belts? \n \n[218] The Deputy First Minister: We need to stress that the only legal requirement that \nwe can impose is in relation to having seat belts. We cannot enforce a regulation through law \nthat says what type of seatbelts they have to be. Therefore, that would have to be done either \nthrough a risk assessment or by issuing guidance and we would draw that to the attention of \nthe appropriate local authority. I am sure that the local authority, using best practice, would \nnot want its vehicles to be fitted with seat belts that were not appropriate for the passengers \nthat the coaches or buses were carrying. \n \n[219] Peter Black: In the explanatory memorandum, we would want an estimate of how \nmuch it would cost a local authority to do that. \n \n[220] The Deputy First Minister: We can only estimate the costs in relation to what we \nare obliged to ask them to impose. We cannot include an estimate of that kind in the \nexplanatory memorandum, because it is an explanatory memorandum to the proposed \nMeasure, and so can only deal with things that are covered by the proposed Measure. If the \ncommittee feels that it would be helpful to talk about what might be included in the guidance \nadditionally, I would be happy to share that information with you. \n \n[221] Andrew Davies: The explanatory memorandum states that the local government data \nunit figures \n \n[222] ?record that approximately one third of the fleet was registered in the UK before 1 \nOctober 2001 and one third after 1 October 2001.? \n \n[223] Where is the other third? \n \n[224] Ms Bateman: Not known. \n \n[225] Andrew Davies: Not known? Therefore, those vehicles are not been registered at all? \n \n[226] Ms Bateman: They will be registered. We asked for a given day, and the local \nauthority did not know whether the vehicle used was registered before or after that date. \n \n[227] Andrew Davies: The local authority did not know? \n \n[228] Ms Bateman: When the survey results came back, the response that we had was \n?unknown?. \n 24 04/11/2010 \n \n[229] Angela Burns: May I ask for clarification on the law? I am not quite clear on this. \nWhen a local authority gives out a bus contract to a company to provide school transport, as \nthe law currently stands, what details does it have to ask the company to provide before the \ncontract is let? Obviously, the company will say that it will provide, say, 20 buses for a \ncertain price, but does it have to say that it will provide 20 buses with eight wheels and so on? \nDoes the company have to list the ages of the buses? \n \n[230] Ms Bateman: It varies across local authorities. Clearly, any vehicles used would \nhave to have a public service vehicle operator?s licence and the drivers would also have to \nhave the equivalent operator?s licence. Different local authorities would then put different \nstipulations in their contracts; therefore, some would ask for three-point all-age seat belts \nwhile others would not. So, there is considerable variation. \n \n2.50 p.m. \n \n[231] The Deputy First Minister: I think that this is a point that we also made elsewhere; \nwe have tried, as best as we can within the competence that we have, to standardise the \nprocedure, because one of the questions put to me was: ?Why do you need a Measure. Why \ncan you not just get a voluntary agreement with local authorities??. However, because we \nhave 22 local authorities the reality is that we tend to have a variety of contracts. The only \ncompetence that we have is to specify that there should be a seat belt. We cannot specify the \nkind of seat belt. Therefore, under this legislation, all vehicles carrying schoolchildren under \ncontracted services will have to have seat belts, whether that is specified in the contract or \nnot, because it will be the law. Part of the difficulty that Bethan has outlined is that one of the \nreasons why we wanted to have this proposed Measure was to ensure that there would be a \nbasic minimum with which buses would have to comply, rather than the interesting but \ndifferent contracts that authorities currently have. \n \n[232] Angela Burns: We return to Rosemary. \n \n[233] Rosemary Butler: Hopefully, the next question will not lead to so many \nsupplementary questions. That was a very interesting point. The explanatory memorandum \nstates that 225 single-decker buses may be required to replace the 132 double-decker buses \ncurrently in operation. Who would meet the costs of replacing the double-decker buses? Also, \nthe legislation committee has heard evidence that there may be hidden costs in replacing \ndouble-decker vehicles, such as costs to those schools that may not be able to accommodate \nthe required number of single-decker buses, to contractors who also may not be able to \naccommodate the required number of single-decker buses, and increases in driver insurance if \nthe number of buses increases. Have you undertaken any estimates of those potential hidden \ncosts? \n \n[234] The Deputy First Minister: We do not think that the hidden costs are substantial \nhere because the vast majority of vehicles are single-decker buses. The number of local \nauthorities that use double-decker buses is quite low. I am not aware, even anecdotally, of any \npotential major difficulties in accommodating a relatively larger number of buses on school \npremises than is currently the case. To return to your original question, which was about the \ncost of double-decker buses, I have also made it clear elsewhere that what we are looking at \nhere is perhaps not the newer double-decker buses, which will be fitted with seat belts, \nCCTV, and other safety features, but at some of the older double-decker buses. Therefore, the \nnumber is even less than that cited in the explanatory memorandum. \n \n[235] Rosemary Butler: Finally, the explanatory memorandum states that up to two thirds \nof the learner transport stock may have been manufactured before 2001, as we discussed \nearlier. If you were to introduce regulations to phase out older buses, who would meet the \n 25 04/11/2010 \ncosts of replacing the buses? \n \n[236] The Deputy First Minister: Over time, it would be the bus operator, but we think \nthat there is merit in us looking at providing assistance to bus operators to replace their stock, \nnot just because of the school transport issue, but for wider considerations, which would be \ngeneral safety and the fact that newer vehicles are likely to have reduced carbon emissions. I \nthink that there is merit in us looking to give a measure of assistance to bus operators to \nreplace their stock or to include the specifications that we have set out in the proposed \nMeasure. \n \n[237] Angela Burns: Do you have a supplementary question to ask, Andrew? \n \n[238] Andrew Davies: Yes. Deputy First Minister, you mentioned earlier the limited levers \nat your disposal. As a Government, you are investing very considerable amounts of money \nthrough free bus travel for older people, for example, and the operators? support grant and a \nrange of other measures. Therefore, the Government has quite a lot of financial leverage. Has \nthere been any consideration as to how you might use that? \n \n[239] The Deputy First Minister: Yes, there has. You make a very important point. To be \nfair, many bus operators have been replacing their stock on the back of that investment. In \nWales, in recent years, there has been a good replacement of stock, and that is particularly \ntrue in some parts of Wales. So, we would certainly want to see what we can do to leverage in \nthe investment that we make to ensure that vehicles are updated regularly. You are right that \nwe should be doing a bit more of that. \n \n[240] Andrew Davies: I suppose that it is the lower end of the market that we are talking \nabout really, and how you use the levers for that. The quality, top end of the market will \nprobably be doing it anyway. \n \n[241] The Deputy First Minister: Yes. Some operators have done it and have recognised \nthat they have done it because of the level of support that we have given. \n \n[242] Angela Burns: Irene, I think that you have questions on visual images and sound. \n \n[243] Irene James: Yes, Chair. The explanatory memorandum identifies the costs of fitting \nand maintaining CCTV. Are there any hidden costs associated with the installation of CCTV \ncameras, such as the costs associated with the storage of digital records? \n \n[244] The Deputy First Minister: We do not think that there is a significant cost in \nrelation to storage, because many vehicle operators have CCTV cameras on their vehicles \nalready, and our understanding is that the cost of storage is not a significant part of their \noverall expenditure on CCTV. That is our current understanding, but perhaps Bethan would \nlike to expand a little on that. \n \n[245] Ms Bateman: We have noted in the explanatory memorandum that there may be \nadministrative costs and other costs. It is difficult to quantify the costs and to go further with \nthe costings without specifically knowing the regulation that we would set out. However, \nwhen we come to make regulation on CCTV, we would repeat the regulatory impact \nassessment and the data gathering, and we would then be able to give a much more fine-\ngrained assessment of those hidden costs. We are recognising them at the moment, but it is \nnecessary to specify what is in the regulation to take the next step, unfortunately.  \n \n[246] Angela Burns: Peter, do you want to come in on this point? \n \n[247] Peter Black: Yes, although Bethan has largely dealt with what I was going to ask. \n 26 04/11/2010 \nClearly, you will make a regulation on the operation and control of CCTV, how the data are \nstored and who has access to it. The data will have to be stored for a certain period, in case \nthere are incidents, and there will be a cost. However, as yet, you have no idea what that cost \nwill be. \n \n[248] Mr Price: While there clearly will be a cost, it will not be significant. That is based \non our experience of monitoring CCTV and using it on our own networks. So, for instance, \nwe keep our CCTV for seven days and it usually wiped after that. There are costs, but they \nare minor in comparison with fitting CCTV and the other aspects that we have costed fully. \n \n[249] Ms Bateman: It is worth adding that we have a number of pilot schemes looking at \nCCTV and the use of escorts and at different ways of setting that up. Our approach to \nregulation has been to look at the work of the transport consortia and other groups, such as the \nAssociation of Transport Co-ordinating Officers, in order to build on best practice. So, in \ndeveloping the regulation, we would work closely alongside local authorities to ensure \nthat we do not place additional burdens that we are not aware of on them in the \nregulations. We have had a relationship with local government and the bus operators, \nwhich have been quite happy to comment on the development of this legislation as it goes \nforward. We recognise that in some areas that specific knowledge is incredibly important \nin telling us whether there are hidden costs. \n \n[250] Peter Black: Most bus operators will not have any expertise in the recording and \nstorage of this sort of material, so there will be a need for training and perhaps new personnel \ninvolved. \n \n[251] The Deputy First Minister: As well as training in the use of CCTV and storage of \nthe data, people will need to be satisfied that the images are being used for the right purpose, \nand we need to bear in mind the civil liberty arguments around their use and where those \nimages are used. So, there is a need for a lot of thought around the regulation and how it is \nintroduced and to have an understanding then of the associated costs. \n \n[252] Irene James: Who will bear the cost? \n \n[253] The Deputy First Minister: The operator will bear the cost. \n \n[254] Andrew Davies: That is different from the situation with regard to Arriva Trains \nWales, is it not? It has been given significant funding by the Assembly Government to fit \nCCTV on its rolling stock. \n \n[255] The Deputy First Minister: Our feeling is that the operator should bear the cost. \nWhether the Government makes a contribution towards that cost is a matter for us to \ndetermine. I have asked officials to start working out schemes whereby we could make a \ncontribution towards the cost, and we are actively looking at that, but as a former Minister for \nfinance, you will appreciate that that is a matter for negotiation at present. \n \n3.00 p.m. \n \n[256] Andrew Davies: As a former Minister for transport, however, I also remember that \nthe bus operators used to complain of what they perceived to be unequal treatment as opposed \nto the Assembly Government?s attitude towards the rail industry. I gave you the example of \nCCTV. \n \n[257] The Deputy First Minister: Bethan mentioned some pilot schemes, and some useful \ninformation is coming out of them about the effectiveness of CCTV cameras on vehicles for \n 27 04/11/2010 \nlearner travel. That will inform a great deal of the work that we will need to do in relation to \nthe introduction of that particular specification. \n \n[258] Angela Burns: Irene, did you want to ask any further questions? \n \n[259] Irene James: No, that is fine. \n \n[260] Peter Black: The proposed Measure allows for regulations to be made that would \nensure that drivers of learner transport have completed appropriate training. Are there any \ncost implications for local authorities or school governing bodies and, if so, has there been an \nestimate made of these costs?  \n \n[261] The Deputy First Minister: We do not think that there would be additional costs to \nthis, because drivers currently have to attain what is known as the driver certificate of \nprofessional competence. Some modelling work has been done by the South West Wales \nIntegrated Transport Consortium on a module, and I will ask Bethan to give a little more \ndetail on that. Basically, we would add a module to the existing training programme, which \nwould incur no additional cost, because the operators currently bear the cost of driver \ntraining. \n \n[262] Ms Bateman: The SWWITCH project has developed a way of working with drivers \nso that they can detect bullying, they are trained to work with children and they learn fire \nevacuation procedures. It is basic training, but tailored towards the school journey because, at \nthe moment, you could have a driver certificate of professional competence without having \nundertaken a school journey training module. Therefore, the consortium has developed one, \nand we propose to roll out that best practice through regulation. \n \n[263] Peter Black: The explanatory memorandum also states that the cost of providing \nschool escorts for all primary school vehicles would be ?694,000. How comprehensive is that \nfigure? Does it take account of recruitment and training costs and, if not, what is the \nassessment of those additional costs?  \n \n[264] The Deputy First Minister: It would need to take into account the full direct and \nassociated costs in order for it to be a realistic figure. We have made it clear in our proposal \nthat we expect that the escorts would only be mandatory on primary school transport. \nHowever, the question is whether the figure is comprehensive and robust. \n \n[265] Ms Bateman: At the moment, the figure is a broad costing of how much it costs each \nlocal authority. We got that by comparing the cost of an escort in a number of different local \nauthorities and then we acknowledged that there would be other costs. When we roll this out \nin regulation, it will be important to analyse some of these changes in regulation and some of \nthe changes in the efficiency of bus operations. For example, double tripping or a more \nimaginative use of local authority transport could help to mitigate some of those costs. \nRolling it out will depend on the detail of the regulation and whether we will be able to work \nwith local authorities to look at other efficiencies alongside that to give a final costing. \n \n[266] Peter Black: However, at this stage, ?694,000 is not a rock solid figure, because \nthere are other costs on top of that. You may have savings as part of that, but you do not know \nwhat they are. \n \n[267] Ms Bateman: The other costs would be marginal compared with the figures that we \nhave quoted. \n \n[268] The Deputy First Minister: If I remember correctly, under the Learner Travel \n(Wales) Measure 2008, there was a proposal, which some people criticised, to start the school \n 28 04/11/2010 \nday at different times. That would enable the use of a bus for more than one school journey at \nparticular times, which could lead to cost savings. \n \n[269] Angela Burns: Do you want to come in with a quick supplementary question, \nAndrew? \n \n[270] Andrew Davies: On the issues of driver training and the use of escorts, what \ndiscussions and what engagement have you or your officials had with the appropriate trade \nunions? \n \n[271] The Deputy First Minister: I will need to check, but I do not think that there has \nbeen any discussion with trade unions on that. We would expect that, when the regulation \nintroducing the specification is taken forward, the consultation will then take into account all \nthe relevant stakeholders, which will include the trade unions.  \n \n[272] Angela Burns: Andrew, you have the next question, which is on civil sanctions.  \n \n[273] Andrew Davies: I am just wondering what the latest thinking is on how this might \noperate. I understand that you were in committee this morning and made some comments. \n \n[274] The Deputy First Minister: The latest thinking is that there are two ways that you \ncan approach it: you can either set up your own enforcement authority, which would be \nentirely separate from anything that currently exists, or you could contract with an existing \nbody; the suggestion that was put to me this morning was VOSA, which would be \nappropriate, and I am totally open-minded about that. Basically, we want to do this in the \nmost cost-effective way, and if that means contracting with another organistion, then I am \nperfectly happy to look at that proposal. Similarly, if any case needs to be taken to some form \nof tribunal, then the question is whether we set up a new body to consider the hearings or we \nuse the existing tribunal system. Again, it is about cost-benefit analysis and value for money; \nif we can do it better by using existing organisations, then we would be happy to do that. \n \n[275] Andrew Davies: I commend that approach. The explanatory memorandum states that \nthere may also be an increase in insurance costs for local authorities. What estimate has been \nmade of those costs? \n \n[276] The Deputy First Minister: I will ask Bethan to come in in a minute, but we are not \nconvinced that there would be an increase, because if you are making the transport safer, then \nthere is an argument that the insurance costs would come down. The truth is that when lorries \nwere mandated to carry tachographs, insurance costs came down. So, there is an argument \nthat those costs will be lower.  \n \n[277] Ms Bateman: It was raised with us by local government that the insurance costs \nwould go up. We noted those concerns, but we then spoke with transport companies about \ntachograph regulation for lorries and it appeared that insurance costs went down rather than \nup. We have noted that the WLGA is concerned about this, but actually, we suspect that costs \nwill not rise.  \n \n[278] Andrew Davies: I have never known the WLGA to admit to costs going down, so I \nam not surprised by that. What are the local authorities? arrangements for paying insurance? \nIs it done on a consortium or block basis, or is it paid individually? \n \n[279] The Deputy First Minister: That is a question that I cannot answer, and I am not \nsure that my officials can. \n \n[280] Ms Bateman: I would suspect that it is done individually, because I am not aware of \n 29 04/11/2010 \nany examples of co-contracting across local authority areas. I would suspect that they would \nprocure insurance on an individual basis. However, I would like to check that and come back \nto you. \n \n[281] The Deputy First Minister: On the wider point, Andrew, there may be added \nadvantages to local authorities in having joint contracting. \n \n[282] Andrew Davies: I would assume that they would be actively pursuing this. Maybe \nwe could make that suggestion. \n \n[283] Angela Burns: Andrew, do you have any further questions? I see not, so we move on \nto Chris on tribunal costs. \n \n[284] Chris Franks: You started to touch on the issue of tribunal costs, and I note that the \nadjudication panel costs a few years ago amounted to ?85,000 per annum. You are basing \ntribunal costs on those of the adjudication panel. Why have you used that as a basis for your \nestimate? \n \n3.10 p.m. \n \n[285] The Deputy First Minister: We felt that the number of cases that were likely to \nappear before a tribunal was similar to the number that has appeared before the adjudication \npanel. So, we did it on the basis of the likely numbers. Although sanctions are included in the \nproposed Measure, you hope that you will never have to use them and that people comply \nwith the new legislation. To make a wider point, it has been encouraging that the evidence \nshows that, as a result of the behavioural code that was introduced under earlier legislation, \nbehaviour has improved. So, the likelihood is that, if we add the specifications that we have \nnoted in this proposed Measure alongside the work that has already been done under the \nbehavioural code, the number of incidents will fall even further. Therefore, we hope that the \nsanctions would be available but would hardly ever have to be used. However, they would be \nthere in case they are needed.  \n \n[286] To come back to your original question, although I may have answered it in a \nroundabout way, the figure was based on a similar number of cases.  \n \n[287] Chris Franks: So, that is the optimistic scenario; what happens if it goes the other \nway and there is a serious increase in the number of cases? \n \n[288] The Deputy First Minister: Once again, I am happy to look at various options rather \nthan to create a new regulatory system with appointments having been made to tribunals. I am \nhappy to look at the use of an existing tribunal system in order to reduce the costs.  \n \n[289] Angela Burns: Deputy First Minister, do you or your officials wish to make any \nfurther comments on this? \n \n[290] The Deputy First Minister: I have no further comments. \n \n[291] Angela Burns: Do committee members have any further questions? I see that there \nare none. Deputy First Minister, I thank you and your officials very much for your time this \nafternoon.  \n \nCynnig Trefniadol \nProcedural Motion \n \n[292] Angela Burns: I move that \n 30 04/11/2010 \n \nthe committee resolves to exclude the public from the remainder of the meeting in accordance \nwith Standing Order No. 10.37. \n \n[293] I see that the committee is in agreement.  \n \nDerbyniwyd y cynnig. \nMotion agreed. \n \nDaeth rhan gyhoeddus y cyfarfod i ben am 3.12 p.m. \nThe public part of the meeting ended at 3.12 p.m. \n \n \n 31 \n"]},

It  is being championed by volunteers who have won continuing care cases after lengthy battles challenging the system.\n\nHow to get in touch with the group\n\n If you are challenging a continuing care decision and would like to be put in touch with the network please email NHSCC@alzheimers.org.uk or call Alzheimer's Society dementia helpline on 0845 300 0336. Please provide the following information: \n\n\n \tYour name \n\tYour email address \n\tYour telephone number - landline is preferable \n\tThe name of the Primary Care Trust where you have been refused NHS continuing healthcare \n\tWhether the person is in their own home or in a care home setting. \n\n\n Members of the NHS Continuing Care Volunteer Support group are all volunteers who have successfully obtained NHS Continuing Care funding. They offer practical support and information based on their own experience. They do not offer legal advice. The volunteers' time is given freely to help others and they offer support specifically to individuals who are challenging NHS Continuing Care funding decisions themselves. Whilst you do not need to engage a solicitor to do this you may decide to do so. We are sorry but our limited resources mean we cannot provide any additional support to those approaching a solicitor or other advisors.\n\n Photo: Mike Pearce (right) receiving a William Brooks Volunteer Award for his work as volunteer for the NHS continuing care support group.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tContact the Society\n\n    Email: \n\n    enquiries@alzheimers.org.uk\n\n    Telephone: \n\n    +44 (0) 20 7423 3500\n\n    Send your feedback or find key contact details.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n    Bookmark this page\n\n    \t\tdelicious\n\tdigg\n\tStumbleUpon\n\tReddit\n\tFacebook\n\tWhat is social bookmarking?\n\n\n    \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFurther information\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tTop ten tips and hints on preparing your case for NHS continuing healthcare\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tA personal perspective\t\n\t\n\n\tReflections by Barbara Pointon on making a complaint to the Health Ombudsman's following a decision to refuse NHS continuing healthcare funding.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tBack to NHS continuing healthcare page\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tJoin Alzheimer's Society Campaigners' Network\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tTools\n\n\t\tRelated Downloads\n\tGet Document as PDF\n\tPrint this page\n\tEmail this to a friend\n\tComment on this page\n\n\n\n\n﻿\n\tOnline forum\n\n\tVisit Talking Point and take part in the discussion\n\n\t\tHelp !!!!\n\tHelp !!!!\n\tI am so fed up with the pathetic excuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tCategories\n\n\t\tHome\n\tAbout dementia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tLiving with dementia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tCaring for a person with dementia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tLocal information\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tNews and media\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tGet involved\n\tDonate\n\tFundraise\n\tCampaign\n\tVolunteer\n\tCompanies and trusts\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tResearchers and professionals\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tOnline Forum\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tAbout us\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCall our Helpline number\n\t\t\t0845 300 0336\n\t\t\tfor information and support\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tQuick links\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGet Involved\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVolunteer\n\tDonate\n\tFundraise\n\tRaffle\n\tMembership\n\tCampaign\n\tResearch\n\tE-newsletter\n\tAlzheimer's Society Shop\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMaking Contact\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact the Alzheimer's Society\n\tContact the helpline\n\tFind local services and information\n\tTalking Point online forum\n\tShare your story\n\tSharing your experience\n\tPress office\n\tJobs/Volunteering opportunities\n\tResearch grant information\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFurther Info\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is dementia?\n\tSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\tFactsheets on dementia\n\tLiving with dementia\n\tLiving with dementia magazine\n\tTraining and publications\n\tLatest news\n\tLibrary\n\tAnnual report\n\tUseful websites\n\tPrivacy and security\n\tSite map\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFollow us\n\n\t\t\t\t Facebook\n\t Twitter\n\t Youtube\n\t Flickr\n\t RSS\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAll content © 2011 Alzheimer's Society.

She cared for the needs of \"Children of the lower orders\" and decided to build a school. It was sited in New Penkridge Road and was completed in 1828. One major influence in looking after the poor was The National Society of the Church of England. It often helped to provide furniture and equipment for schools, so Ann Claycroft Walhouse named it The Walhouse National School. The name can still be seen today, though the building is no longer part of the school.\n\nAfter its foundation as a Boys' school, it was followed by a separate Girls' school which opened in 1874. There were four different Mistresses in the first four years. The first one left after just six months, the next one stayed just for one year. It would appear that she received a visit from the H.M.I. one afternoon and resigned within the hour. In 1878 Mr Napier Henry Walker and his wife Margaret were appointed Master and Mistress of the Boy's and Girl's schools respectively. \n\nThis was the start of a great and distinguished chapter in the history of the school. In 1900 the name of Minnie Walker appeared on the staff list for the first time. She was the eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs N.H.Walker. \nMrs Margaret Walker resigned due to ill health on the 30th April 1913 after 35 years of service as Mistress and then Head Mistress of the Girl's School. Mr Napier Henry Walker was Master of the Boy's School until 1914 when he resigned, he was known to all the pupils as \"Nappy\" Walker (Behind his back of course).\n\nNapier and Margaret Walker had worked through life side by side and in death they are buried side by side in the grounds of St. Lukes Parish Church. Minnie Walker remained as Headteacher of the Girl's School until 1945 and is still remembered by a lot of people to this day.\n\nThe Boy's and Girl's School was amalgamated in January 1959. Arthur Hampton took over as Headteacher in January 1963. He retired at the end of the Summer Term in 1982, after 19 years of faithful service to the school. David Pearsall took over as Headteacher until 2001.\n \nAt the end of its Autumn term in 2004 the curtain will finally fall on the name of Walhouse School, as it merges with another old school - John Wood. In January 2005 the merged schools will be known as St.Luke's School.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\nSearch projects:\n\n \n\nFilter by region:\n\nSelect region\nEast Midlands\nEast of England\nLondon Area\nNorth East\nNorth West\nSouth East\nSouth West\nWest Midlands\nYorkshire & The Humber\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\nLegal Notice | Site by Torchbox \t\n\n© Countryside Agency 2006\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n",
