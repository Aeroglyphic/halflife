With its lowered sports suspension,\nbody-coloured bumpers, bump strips, door mirrors and handles, striking\nrear, side and front spoilers and the honeycomb grille, it embodies what\nhas always distinguished a GTI: an uncompromising passion for sportiness.\nPowered by a 2.0 litre T-FSI engine with an exceptional 230 PS and\na six speed manual gearbox – or optional six speed DSG gearbox – it\ntransmits pure power to the stylish 18 inch ‘Pescara’ alloy wheels with\n225/40 R18 tyres, driving it from 0-62 mph in just 6.8 seconds. And the\nexhaust system with twin tailpipes makes it unmistakably clear who calls\nthe tune.\nInside, the new Golf GTI Edition 30 combines classic GTI interior with\nsporty comfort. The individually adjustable and heated front sports seats\nfeature the legendary GTI ‘Interlagos’ cloth upholstery with side bolsters\nin ‘Vienna’ leather, offering optimum lateral support. The three-spoke\nleather trimmed steering wheel, complete with red stitching and GTI logo,\nhas been ergonomically designed for a particularly dynamic driving style,\nand together with the 2Zone electronic climate control makes sure that\nyou keep a cool head during every journey. Unique ‘Edition 30’ badging,\nfront and rear carpet mats with red edging and aluminium-look pedals\ncomplete a look that is sure get your pulse racing, but the only way to truly\nunderstand its power and charisma is to drive it for yourself. Experience\nan automotive legend – in the most powerful Golf GTI of all time.\n01 The interior of the Golf GTI Edition 30 automatic DSG is instantly\nrecognisable with its unique sport seats in ‘Interlagos’ cloth\nupholstery with side bolsters in ‘Vienna’ leather.

Bo Creel and Scratch Morton are just such men. Now they've been hired for the one job they've never tried: wearing badges - in a little stain of a town called Whiskey Flats.What Bo and Scratch don't know is that a gang of outlaws is bent on burning down the town the Sidewinders have been hired to protect. With only a passing acquaintance of the law, a keen sense of self-preservation, and a range war gathering round them, Bo and Scratch need a good plan or it's a one way ticket to Boot Hill.

The research and discoveries of the CSCB are central to the long-term goal of developing clinical applications for pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine.\nWe were the first laboratory to undertake research on human embryonic stem cells in the UK in 1999 and have played a major role in training scientists in this dynamic field. The Centre complements the overall strength in Developmental Biology and Medicine at the University of Sheffield.\nWe coordinate the International Stem Cell Initiative, an international consortium of laboratories defining standards. It is also the  main partner in ESTOOLS, an EU funded collaboration of researchers developing technologies for embryonic stem cells.\nThe expertise and excellent facilities of the CSCB represents a significant opportunity for collaborative activity with all organisations involved in pluripotent stem cell research.\nInternational Symposium sponsored by the UKIERI\nHuman Pluripotent Stem Cells: Progress to Therapy\nContributions from Developmental Biology\nSheffield, UK 8th to 10th April, 2013\nOrganisers: Peter W.

Development of these applications depends on our fundamental understanding of how such cells make fate decisions between self-renewal on the one hand, and differentiation into distinct lineages on the other.\nConsiderable progress has already been made and, today, applications in all of these areas are now on the horizon, and some clinical trials for regenerative medicine have begun. However, much still remains to be done, and our knowledge of the mechanisms that guide development of the embryo is central to understanding how to manipulate pluripotent stem cells.\nIn this meeting we will bring together key researchers from India and the UK to discuss the progress in developing applications for pluripotent human stem cells and to address how developmental biology is contributing to that progress\nSpeakers include:\nProfessor Joshua Brickman\nDr Tim Chico\nDr Cédric Ghevaert\nProfessor Chris Denning\nProfessor Neil Hanley\nDr Kouichi Hasegawa\nProfessor Maneesha Inamdar\nDr Tilo Kunath\nProfessor Meng Li\nProfessor Harry Moore\nDr Mahendra Rao\nDr Marcelo Rivolta\nDr Suvasini Ramaswamy\nDr G V Shivashankar\nProfessor Andrew Smith\nProfessor Claudio Stern\nDr Vijay Tiwari\nProfessor David Tosh\nWe will be holding a poster session, abstracts are invited.\nPlease email Nick Childs at N.Childs@sheffield.ac.uk by Friday 8th March 2013.\nRegistration will be open shortly, £25 early bird discounted symposium registration, £40 conference dinner.\nFurther information see our Training and Events page.\nLatest News\nDiscovery Night at the University of Sheffield\nThe Stem Cell promise: Exploring the most potent stem cells for future clinical treatments\nMonday 18 March 2013\nTime: 4 - 8.30pm\nPlace: BMS conference room.

Molyneux and      Mrs. A. Parkinson-Curd. Consequently there is a history and presence which enables us to maintain a homely atmosphere and family values. The main building, in pleasant, secluded grounds, houses the junior school and reception, library and dining and kitchen accommodation. In separate outside classrooms, bounded by lawns and playgrounds, are the Infant classes which allows us to keep KS1 together.\nThroughout the school the children are arranged into classes by age group, keeping within their correct school year. The same full-time member of staff remains with the year group for the whole academic year to ensure mutual stability, teaching the basic core subjects. In the Junior School specialisations in teaching emerge, and staff teach their specialist subjects throughout the junior department, as well as caring for their own form. Therefore, although the Pre-School, Infant and Junior departments are separate, they meet and play together as often as it is relevant to do so, thus developing interdependence and, among older boys and girls, a sense of responsibility and caring.\nAs accredited members of the ISA, we are invited to join activities with other like minded schools\nLast Updated on Tuesday, 12 October 2010 14:44\n \nGo to top\nLogin Form\nUsername\nPassword\nRemember Me\nForgot your password?\nForgot your username?\nKey Dates\nMon May 13, 2013\nKey Stage II - SATs\nFri May 17, 2013\nGala Heats\nTue May 21, 2013\nClass Photographs\nWed May 22, 2013\nCressing Temple\nWed May 22, 2013\nMarchants Hill Residential Trip\nThu May 23, 2013\nMarchants Hill Residential Trip\nThu May 23, 2013\nStaff Meeting\nMon May 27, 2013\nHalf Term (one Week)\nTue May 28, 2013\nHalf Term (one Week)\nWed May 29, 2013\nHalf Term (one Week)\nSubscribe to RSS Feed\nWho's Online\nWe have 2 guests online\nCopyright © 2013 Gidea Park College.

The tests are used to assess the response to a potential chemical or toxic accident that could result in contaminated patients presenting to ED.\nMuch faster, more efficient\nPrevious assessments showed that the decontamination tent took anything between 20 minutes to an hour to put up but a new âdeluxe decontamination facilityâ was tested earlier this week that went up in precisely two and a half minutes.\nSteven Swift is head of major incident planning, he said: âWe used to have three different structures, one for patients to remove their clothes before they were taken to the shower tent with a third to dry and re-robe. It had a floor that was very difficult to put together and, to protect privacy and dignity, it was strictly one patient at a time so patient flow would be quite cumbersome.\nâThis new triple structure is much more efficient and features a modesty curtain so that we can decontaminate two patients, male or female, at a time with more speed using warm water and a better integrated sump to collect and drain the water.\nâBy being able to put this up more effectively it means we will be ready to receive and treat patients much faster than before and allow more of our ED staff to attend to these patients sooner.â\nThe test was a resounding success and members of the ED team have been invited to Milton Keynes to advise on the development of new PPS chemical suits to assess what is practical and what isnât.\nâAs prepared as we possibly can beâ\nSteven added: âDecontamination training has changed with much stricter regulations and conditions to adhere to since the turn of the year. We need to ensure that all equipment is checked once a month and replaced if used. We also need to ensure that our ED staff attend âtrain the trainerâ sessions to be able to cascade this knowledge to the rest of the department and this extends to porters and security staff in the event of large scale incidents where ED staff may be too busy with patients to put up the decontamination tent.\nâAs always Iâd like to thank the enthusiasm and dedication of the all members of staff who took part in this activity. Every time we conduct such an exercise or session we learn more about how we might react to a genuine incident to ensure that, if the worst were to happen, we are as prepared as we possibly can be.â\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ \nContact\nFeedback\nGP login\nSitemap\nTranslate\nTranslate\nThis site can be automatically translated into various languages by Google Translate.

Its Victorian buildings were deemed unfit for purpose in 2003.\nVivienne Mowatt, Broadmoor Hospital redevelopment manager, conceded that accommodation for patients in the older part of the hospital was more akin to a prison cell than a room in a hospital.\n\"It's important that we make the changes now to be able to deliver modern health care for patients in a high secure setting.\n\"The Victorian buildings don't lend themselves to create the right environment for this,\" she said.\n'Worthwhile cause'\nMs Mowatt said applications to turn the Victorian buildings into a hotel or conference centre would be welcomed but dismissed any suggestion that developers would be permitted to transformed them into flats.\nThe two buildings will be outside the hospital's new secure perimeter, once they have been sold.\nWhen asked why people would chose to stay in a hotel next to high security psychiatric hospital, Ms Mowatt said: \"There are many people in this community who have lived next to Broadmoor Hospital for many, many years and quite comfortably.\"\nFunds for the project will come from the West London Mental Health Trust's capital funds, in addition to capital raised by selling off land. The remainder is expected to be provided by central government.\nMs Mowatt added: \"It's a very worthwhile cause that we have been trying to do for many, many, years...it's well overdue and it's time it was redeveloped and changed.\"\nBroadmoor opened in 1863 as England's first asylum for the criminally insane.\nIn 2003 the ageing Victorian buildings were declared \"unfit for purpose\" by the Commission For Healthcare Improvement.\nOften incorrectly referred to as a prison, some of the country's most notorious killers and sex offenders have been treated within the hospital.\nMore on This Story\nRelated Stories\nBroadmoor revamp plan is approved\n16 MARCH 2012,\nBERKSHIRE\nBroadmoor revealed in online book\n25 NOVEMBER 2011,\nBERKSHIRE\nInside Broadmoor\n09 MAY 2011,\nTODAY\nRelated Internet links\nBroadmoor Hospital\nWest London Mental Health NHS Trust\nBracknell Forest Council\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites\nShare this page\nDelicious\nDigg\nFacebook\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nBBC Berkshire\n'Princess and the pot' is rare find\nThe remains of a \"woman of importance\" who was buried with a pot during the Copper Age is discovered in a Berkshire quarry.\nBroadmoor access road works start\nDuchess awards honours to scouts\nTravel news\nLatest road incidents, public transport information and live traffic jam cameras near you\nWeather\nGrey Cloud\nï\nBerkshire\nMin.

This is a great advantage to you because it means that whatever size your garden, there will be a summerhouse to fit the space you’ve got picked out. All of Mercia’s products are made from sustainable forest wood, so you know that your summerhouse didn’t take away a tree from the environment, because Mercia planted a new one.\nIf you’re looking for a summerhouse that can be useful even over winter then the Helios Summer House is the one for you. This summerhouse is spacious enough to have many people seated in it enjoying the summer sun, and the windows are placed to specifically let in as much light as possible for the user to enjoy. As the year turns cold the summerhouse can become a storage facility for your bikes and garden tools, this is because it is fully secured and so is safe enough to act as a shed for half the year, meaning that it isn’t wasted space.\nHowever, if you’re after a summerhouse that is specifically all about relaxation all year round then the Octagonal Summerhouse is the product for you. The all-around windows let light in from wherever it may be, making the perfect summerhouse for relaxing in the warmth. When winter rolls around though, a simple heater will mean that the summerhouse is still enjoyable, and with the addition of an electrical outlet this could become a home away from home for those who like their own space.\nFor those seeking the ultimate dream summerhouse to complete their idyllic country getaway though, the Premium Traditional Summerhouse is the best product. This summerhouse looks like it’s just come out of a fairy tale and is perfect for sharing family time on the veranda in the sun, maybe even in an old Parker Knoll chair.\n \n \nhome | products | services |\ncontact us | about us | privacy policy\n| site map\ncopyrights 2010.

In a poll of 1000 adults 34 per cent of the public accepted that 'Jesus was born to a virgin called Mary'.\nOver a third of Brits believe in the virgin birth\n \nNew research reveals that more than one in three Britons believe Jesus was born of a virgin. ComRes polled over 1,000 adults for theology think tank Theos, and found that 34 per cent of the public accepted that ‘Jesus was born to a virgin called Mary’. In fact, the survey showed that more people believe the virgin birth is historical than believe in angels (28 per cent). It also discovered that more women (39 per cent) believe in the event than men (29 per cent), and most Brits (56 per cent) believe Jesus was born in\nBethlehem\n. The majority (52 per cent) also say that the birth of Jesus holds personal significance for them, and 57 per cent intend to celebrate Christmas as a religious festival.\n \nSource: Theos (8/12)\nhttp://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/1_in_3_Britons_believe_in_virgin_birth.aspx?ArticleID=2728&PageID=14&RefPageID=5\n \nOffice posted the article on Tuesday, 16th December 2008 at 8:51pm\nSt Barnabas takes every care to check the accuracy of news information from external sources listed on our website, but we realise errors can happen.

I trained her to use the toilet early with the CitiKitty. She at one point stopped using it, then I got her to use it again like 6 months later. Anyway, have had this cat for over 3 years now things are great.\nAt the beginning of this year I got a second cat. Her name is Marble. She was 2 years old when I got her. I got the litter kwitter and she used the first disc immediately with no problems. Sadly I have to keep her separated from my other cat because my other cat loves the idea of using litter if its available. The problem is is when I switch disc's she stops using it. She will continue to urinate on it but then poops on the floor beside the toilet. This is very very frustrating. I also went back and bought a CitiKitty for her as well to see if she would do better with that since it has a smaller hole. First disc with that was fine, as soon as I switched again she started using the floor again.\nI'm so frustrated that I almost want to take her back to the humane society. I am trying one new final tactic, I am locking her in a pet cage and giving her scheduled bathroom breaks. I'm hoping that she will not use the cage for her bathroom and try to let her out as frequently as possible. My hope is that eventually she will start to use the toilet without me having to baby sit her.\nDoes anyone have anymore tips?\ntehaon\nView Public Profile\nFind all posts by tehaon\nÂ \nÂ«\nPrevious Thread\n|\nNext Thread\nÂ»\nThread Tools\nShow Printable Version\nEmail this Page\nDisplay Modes\nSwitch to Linear Mode\nSwitch to Hybrid Mode\nThreaded Mode\nPosting Rules\nYou may not post new threads\nYou may not post replies\nYou may not post attachments\nYou may not edit your posts\nvB code is On\nSmilies are On\n[IMG] code is On\nHTML code is Off\nForum Jump\nUser Control Panel\nPrivate Messages\nSubscriptions\nWho's Online\nSearch Forums\nForums Home\nWelcome to Doogie's *NEW* LITTER KWITTER Cat Toilet Training Forums\nTROUBLESHOOTING ADVICE\nÂ  Â  Things You Should Read First!\nÂ  Â  NEW! - Doogie's Do's & Don'ts\nÂ  Â  Tips & Tricks from Doogie's Wealth of Toilet-Training Knowledge!\nTOILET TRAINING CHAT\nÂ  Â  General Training Issues - Red, Amber and Green stages\nSUCCESS STORIES\nÂ  Â  Feedback From Lots of Clever Cats!\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nÂ  Â  Questions About The Product.\nYOUR THEORIES ON CAT BEHAVIOUR\nÂ  Â  On why some cats will urinate in the toilet but poo on the floor...\nÂ  Â  Multiple cats in training\nÂ  Â  Quick learners\nÂ  Â  Cat communication\nAll times are GMT +11.

He got completely soaked in the shower.\nTry your Kit in the Shower\nCheck out if your poncho or rainwear is waterproof\nand avoid disappointment later.\nYour shower is a great place to simulate a massive downpour.\nA hose pipe in the garden can simulate wind blown rain from the side.\nFor the purpose of this test we've asked our poncho enthusiast Ooli\nto step into the shower in a white poncho.\nHe wore jeans and a thin hoodie to make leaks more visible.\nNeedless to say he got completely soaked in the end, but he enjoyed this a lot as you can see form the photos.\nSo get ready for some interesting fun.\nWaterproofing Test Sequence\nRepeat this test sequence for all your rainwear so you know how well it does.\nStart with dry clothes underneath each time,\nlike a long sleeve hooded T-shirt and jeans so you can spot where your rain suit or poncho leaks.\nFor each of the following tests step into the shower for a minute.\nKeep the water temperature a bit lower than usual (but still comfortable) so you can feel any leaks.\nAfter one minute come out and take the poncho off to check for any wet spots on your clothes.\nThen move on to the next test.\nTest 1: Poncho with hood up\nPut your poncho on, get the hood up and tie it so you can still see where you go.\nMake sure it is comfortable, not too tight or too lose.\nSee if the hood moves as you turn your head, or if it hinders you.\nIn windy conditions the hood may flap about if you don't tie it well.\nGo into the shower for a minute, then come out and take the poncho off.\nMost of the the water runs off the poncho into your lower jeans and shoes.\nYou can avoid that with rain pants and/or gaiters.\nResult:\nYou may find only a few wet spots on your clothes, mainly a bit on your neck where water ran off your face.\nTest 2: Hood down and neck closely tied\nNext put the poncho back on, but keep the hood down.\nTie the draw cord of the poncho hood so it makes a good seal around your neck.\nMake sure it fits well and doesn't chafe.\nNow get back under the shower for a minute.\nYou'll notice that even when you tie the hood around your neck\na certain amount of water will seep in.\nResult:\nAfter this test you'll probably find a few larger wet spots on your clothes, mainly around your neck, back and front.\nYour sides should be fairly dry.\nTest 3: Hood down and loose collar\nFinally put the poncho back on but leave the hood down and don't use the drawcord.\nLeave the collar comfortably open as you would when hiking.\nStep back under the shower for a minute.\nResult:\nA fair amount of water flows from your head into your poncho.\nThe hood fills up with water which gushes out if you bend forward.\nYou probably get soaking wet with only a few dry spots left over.\nComparison\nFor comparison, step into the shower without the poncho.\nFeel the cool water flow through your clothes and chill you more than with the poncho.\nSummary\nIn summary, you'll notice that you're warmer in a poncho than without, especially when you're soaking wet.\nA poncho or rainsuit keeps you warmer because it reduces cooling from evaporation and wind chill,\nor any water flow which could cool you quickly.\nFind the right balance between ventilation and staying dry.\nNow turn up the heat and relax.\n Close Mail  \nHome  \nContents\nCopyright © 2013 Swimwear Guide  (unless stated otherwise)\nAll rights reserved.\nWe are not responsible for the content of external links.\n \n \n \n \n "],

Torn and sliced, ripped with technique. Embellishments and buttons, ribbon and flair, design and graphics an ensemble which reflects long lasting memories to express the art of conveying a language. The language of love, celebration, comfort and encouragement.\n“Encouragement causes power and effect”\nTogether are my collections of Creative Cards which simply brings about the very “nature of giving”\nPages\nHome\nImagine Crafts / Tsukineko Tutorials\nMiscellaneous Tutorials\nSpellbinders Tutorials\nSaturday, July 11, 2009\nYou Ain't Nothin' But a Hound Dog!!\nIt is Saturday here and I am late for one of my favourite challenges...the Twisted Sister Challenge...but it is still Friday there, just so hopefully I will just squeeze in on time - there is no pressure from them, just myself!! Now there are a couple of good reasons why I am late....the challenge was to make a card and name it by a song title...well...there were three possibilities for this....they are:\n1 Puppy Love 2. Paper Roses (a clever suggestion by DH); and 3 You're Nothing But a Hound Dog...\nwhich I have used...but am still torn...so that was a bit of a hold up...but the other reason is that I just couldn't get my head around this card....yesterday we got a phone call from Judy,the lady that bought one of our first puppies, Rosie is about 18 months old now...I hand reared her and her brother...little Rosie is sick and it is terminal...they are not sure how long she has..it could be 6 months, 12 or she could just go in her sleep....I had a little cry and then felt flat all day...but today...I thought I would make this card for Judy, the lady who bought her and loves her dearly....we babysit her (Rosie the puppy NOT Judy) from time to time!!! It is very sad, she is just adorable!! Anyway...enough of that and onto the business side of this card!!\nIt is also for MojoMonday, I have enjoyed using that layout, it worked well with this image from Jocelyn (aka JoBear2) I lightly sponged around the edges of all layers before mounting it on black. The brads and the sentiment, which is also a brad are from a BLOG CANDY that I won from Kimmie some weeks ago....they work so well with this layout. It also fits a third Challenge...Stamping for the Weekend, which is exactly what I am doing, where the theme is chocolate strawberries YUMBLY, as my DH would say!!! Brown and red are great together....so there you have it...one finished card!!\nThank you for visiting and for your comments...I love knowing that you have been - you make my day!! I hope you are enjoying your weekend and get some 'you' time!! God bless you!!\nPosted by\nLovely Linda\nat\n4:18 PM\n3 comments:\nJudy RozemaJuly 12, 2009 at 12:38 AM\nTotally darling image and card!\nReplyDelete\nMaxineJuly 12, 2009 at 10:51 AM\nOhhh - Poor Rosie and her poor people!! Beautiful card though - I love it!!\nReplyDelete\nVickiJuly 13, 2009 at 3:15 AM\nHiya Linda\nOh that is such sad news about Rosie, sending you all lots of cyber hugs.\nThank you for taking part again with this weeks challenge over at SFTW, your card is fabulous, I love the lil doggy image and the \"Woof\" embellie is so cute. Good luck and looking forward to you joining in with more of our challenges, xx vicki xx\nReplyDelete\nAdd comment\nLoad more...\nThank you for your comment, I read and appreciate each one - you make my day! {{hugs}}}\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nAbout Lovely Linda\nLovely Linda\nCanberra, Australia\nI am a stay at home Mum who loves her family and loves to take care of them. I love baking and spending time with special people. I have many creative interests but card making has become a real passion for me and I have met so many beautiful people through making them. I feel that cards are something not be discarded but to be re-read when reflecting or when I feel the need to be picked up. They are a constant reminder of my friends and loved ones and those who care for me. They are a celebration of people and occasions in life. So my contribution to you is to make personalised cards where you can express and write the words of comfort and life in them to inspire, encourage or console. Maybe you would just simply like to express to a friend that they are appreciated. I look forward to meeting you!\nGod bless you, Linda\nView my complete profile\nCopyright\nAll content (including text, photographs, and design work) are © Linda Lucas.

I'm betting the GoDaddy spammer strikes here after the post has been up for a while. Book mark it and see.\nAs spam goes this is fairly sophisticated in design but not execution. It has been written by someone with a good grasp The English Language and a clear understanding of blog comments. It comes undone, however, because the low paid drone posting the text has no way of knowing that I keep posting about how much godaddy sucks money balls.\nIf you want to buy domain names with out spammers getting paid, without gimmicks and pages and pages of pointless crap then I have an offering for you. You can't buy everything including the kitchen sink but you can get domain names.\ndomains.LordMattAndYou.com\nIt's the only place in the world where you can buy a domain and have the person you purchased it through have a look at what you have made and, if it is worth talking about, talk about it right on his blog (here).\nBest of all, in my opinion, spam sponsoring con artists get no money from the deal but your friendly neighbourhood geek gets a few pennies* and all remains right with the world. Your domain will be safe even if it is a dot UK and all the extras shall remain free for so long as I have anything to say on the subject.\n*When I say pennies I'm not being funny, the mark up on this is tiny. I'm just doing it to serve others (and steal a tiny fraction of GoDaddy's business away).\nNOTE: Also, for backside covering reasons, I'd like to point out to godaddy's legal people that this is my opinion of godaddy based on the evidence on my blog (the spam promoted godaddy) - it's not an air tight case but it looks fairly damning to me.\n13/12/2008 · 08:23:09 ·\nCategory: News and Views ·\nPosted by:\nLord Matt ·\nlike\nComments\nNo comments yet\nAdd Comment\nYour comment:\nName:\nWebsite:\nE-mail:\nConvert linebreak to <br>\nRemember Me\nAdd your comment.

At least the sun shone and with only the occasional drop of rain, we climbed until about 5 pm ish.. so we had an ace days cragging on a couple of new crags.\nPubliÃ© par\nSandy Allan\nÃ  l'adresse\n14:38\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nBlog Archive\n► \n2013\n(23)\n► \nApril\n(8)\n► \nMarch\n(10)\n► \nFebruary\n(3)\n► \nJanuary\n(2)\n► \n2012\n(60)\n► \nDecember\n(3)\n► \nSeptember\n(1)\n► \nAugust\n(1)\n► \nJuly\n(5)\n► \nJune\n(1)\n► \nMay\n(7)\n► \nApril\n(9)\n► \nMarch\n(6)\n► \nFebruary\n(11)\n► \nJanuary\n(16)\n► \n2011\n(138)\n► \nDecember\n(12)\n► \nNovember\n(2)\n► \nOctober\n(6)\n► \nSeptember\n(9)\n► \nAugust\n(17)\n► \nJuly\n(12)\n► \nJune\n(8)\n► \nMay\n(7)\n► \nApril\n(9)\n► \nMarch\n(19)\n► \nFebruary\n(17)\n► \nJanuary\n(20)\n▼ \n2010\n(181)\n► \nDecember\n(14)\n► \nNovember\n(10)\n► \nOctober\n(13)\n► \nSeptember\n(16)\n▼ \nAugust\n(19)\nLes Aiguilles Rouges - rock climbing\nTechnical climbing day\nCorma di Machaby setorre Casa Fara, Italy\nles trois Mont Blanc\nAig d'Entreves traverse\nTechnical day\nA quick climb before the storm\nRest days are for:\nLots of snow in the mountains\nGrand Paradiso - contrasts\nA technical skills day in Italy\nSkills day on Mer du Glace\ncycle-summit.com\nGrand Paradiso!\nArete des Cosmiques\nSandy's angels\nPetit Fourche Summit\nMont Blanc\nRock Climbing in Val d'Aosta, Italy\n► \nJuly\n(17)\n► \nJune\n(13)\n► \nMay\n(12)\n► \nApril\n(10)\n► \nMarch\n(18)\n► \nFebruary\n(22)\n► \nJanuary\n(17)\n► \n2009\n(164)\n► \nDecember\n(21)\n► \nNovember\n(5)\n► \nOctober\n(17)\n► \nSeptember\n(8)\n► \nAugust\n(9)\n► \nJuly\n(15)\n► \nJune\n(22)\n► \nMay\n(7)\n► \nApril\n(7)\n► \nMarch\n(19)\n► \nFebruary\n(16)\n► \nJanuary\n(18)\n► \n2008\n(139)\n► \nDecember\n(10)\n► \nNovember\n(10)\n► \nOctober\n(6)\n► \nSeptember\n(10)\n► \nAugust\n(12)\n► \nJuly\n(9)\n► \nJune\n(7)\n► \nMay\n(10)\n► \nApril\n(10)\n► \nMarch\n(23)\n► \nFebruary\n(14)\n► \nJanuary\n(18)\n► \n2007\n(102)\n► \nDecember\n(16)\n► \nNovember\n(10)\n► \nOctober\n(19)\n► \nSeptember\n(17)\n► \nAugust\n(6)\n► \nJuly\n(11)\n► \nJune\n(6)\n► \nMay\n(7)\n► \nApril\n(10)\nAbout Me\nSandy Allan\nSandy is a qualified International Mountain Guide and has guided world wide from gentle walks to technical climbs and 8000 meter summits, including Mount Everest where he was the 5th Scots man to climb the mountain.

If you are not, you'll have to do some\nlegwork and tell it what you really want. The main problem is that the launcher can't figure out what R will\nbe using without running R but yet it has to setup the environment before running R. It's the unfortunate\nmess of Windows where R is setup to work like all unix systems (essentially assuming it's on the PATH), but\nthat doesn't work on Windows. The only way to try to guess which R to run is to ask the registry, but that\ndoesn't have any information on the additional settings such as library paths. So in the end you have\nmultiple information sources fighting each other ... a real mess ... At any rate, if someone wants to clean\nup that mess in some reasonable way, patches are welcome\n.\nCheers,\nSimon\n> --\n> Statistics & Software Consulting\n> GKX Group, GKX Associates Inc.\n> tel: 1-877-GKX-GROUP\n> email: ggrothendieck at gmail.com\n>\n>\nPermalink\n| Reply\n|\nNavigate\nGo to gmane.comp.lang.r.rosuda.devel.\nTopic\nGo to the topic.\nProject Web Page\nList for discussions about the future, proposals of new functionality, pre-testing and other issues relevant to the development of RoSuDa software mainly relating to the R Project.

Three of the case studies concentrate on practice learning using different approaches, and the fourth on restructuring of all health and social care curricula to allow for integration. The juxtaposition of these different approaches enables comparisons between them. The case studies are put into context by Hugh Barr who eloquently describes the changes in professional education policies and structures in the UK over the last 10 years, untangling the new from the old names and processes of the many regulatory bodies as well as reminding the reader of the distinction between ‘common learning’ and ‘interprofessional learning’.

Subject Centre.\n[Expand Summary]\nThis ‘critical review of evaluations of interprofessional education’ is the second of a series of occasional papers commissioned by the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) Centre for Health Sciences and Practice. The first occasional paper by Professor Hugh Barr ‘Interprofessional Education Today, Yesterday and Tomorrow’ set the issue in historical and current context as well as suggesting future directions. This second paper develops the topic by reviewing systematically the literature on evaluations of interprofessional education. The authors found that studies were mostly focused on post-registration continuing professional development, in hospital or community based service delivery settings rather than in universities. The data is largely North American and most frequently represents nursing and medicine, followed by social workers, undifferentiated professions allied to medicine, pharmacists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Other disciplines are hardly represented despite the fact that the Health Services associated with the Centre encompass 30 or so subjects. This indicates that more good quality evaluations are needed within the UK, also at pre-registration level, and within a wider range of subject areas. The paper also critically reviews the quality of the evaluations and provides helpful suggestions for future studies to provide useful information for the development of good practice. It is certain to stimulate reflection and action.\nThis is No 2 of a series of occasional papers commissioned by Higher Education Academy Health Sciences and Practice Subject Centre.\n[Collapse Summary]\nSubject:\nCross Disciplinary,\nInterprofessional Education\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nRevised:\n2011-11-24\nRevisions:\n3\nRating:\nNot yet rated\nEvaluation of programme leading to BSc in Mental Health Studies (nursing and social work)\n(m10180)\nAuthors:\nJenny Weinstein,\nMarkella Boudioni,\nVernon De Maynard,\nEnkanah Sooboodoo\nKeywords:\nEvaluation,\nHealth Sciences and Practice,\nInterprofessional Education,\nJoint Programmes,\nMental Health,\nMini-project,\nNursing\nSummary:\nIn response to user demand for holistic care and government policies promoting interprofessional working, joint programmes have been in existence for 20 years although there has been little systematic evaluation to demonstrate their value.

This two year explorative study aimed to pilot tools for the evaluation of joint Mental Health Nursing and Social Work programmes. The tools were designed to investigate the outcomes of training by examining the knowledge, behaviour and attitudes of students with respect to interprofessional working and mental health at the beginning and at the end of the 2nd year of their training programme using questionnaires, focus groups and OSCEs (Objective Structured Clinical Examinations). The outcomes of the joint programme were compared with the outcomes of two uni-professional programmes – one in mental health and one in social work. All starters on the three programmes in September 2006 were invited to participate. Questionnaires and focus groups were implemented for all participants at T1 (2007) and T2 (2008) but OSCEs were only applied once at the end of the first year and only for the mental health nurses and joint programme students.\n[Collapse Summary]\nSubject:\nMental Health and Psychotherapy,\nNursing Midwifery and Health Visiting\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nRevised:\n2011-06-10\nRevisions:\nNew\nRating:\nNot yet rated\nE-Learning support for interprofessional education in health and social care (ELSIE)\n(m10183)\nAuthors:\nRacquel Morales,\nDawn Leeder\nKeywords:\nE-Learning,\nFinal Report,\nHealth and Social Care,\nInterprofessional Education,\nLearning Resources,\nMini-project\nSummary:\n“E-learning Support for Inter-professional Education in Health and Social Care” (ELSIE) was a 12-month project (October 2004 – October 2005) funded by Health Sciences & Practice Subject Centre to create and evaluate reusable learning objects (RLOs) to support interprofessional education.

Readers familiar with IPE will recognise many of the challenges for the teams introducing interprofessional learning. The intention in this collection is not to provide models of best practice or ‘how to do’ interprofessional education, but contextualised examples with critical reflection on the planning and implementation to enhance transferability and future development.\n[Collapse Summary]\nSubject:\nCross Disciplinary,\nInterprofessional Education\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nRevised:\n2011-06-17\nRevisions:\n4\nRating:\nNot yet rated\nCollaborative Teamwork Skills: How Are They Developed Through Interprofessional Education And Are They Applicable in the Practice Setting\n(m10216)\nAuthors:\nFrances Reynolds,\nRachel Crookenden\nKeywords:\nEvidence Informed Practice,\nFinal Report,\nInterprofessional Education,\nMini-project,\nPractice Education\nSummary:\nThis project examined students’ perceptions of the contribution made by an interprofessional university-based module to skills and understanding of collaborative teamworking on placement.
