The group has raised money for women to learn to sew and buy sewing machines and make soap which then can be sold to the local community, the profits of which can go back into a training programme to allow more women to take part. The group has also started a baking initiative in addition to a Women’s training centre, which is fully equipped with ovens and sewing machines to give the women in the community the equipments they need.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nA not for profit women’s organisation founded in 2006 and based in Wales. This project has emerged from time spent by a member of W4R in rural Tanzania, where women told their stories simply and graphically. Women in South Wales have now added their voices and images with further contributions from Liberia, Kenya and the African diaspora in the UK. W4R became a registered charity in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tYouth\n\t\tSwansea - Kenya Education Link\n\n\n\t\tLivelihoods\n\t\tSwansea - Liberia Livelihood Project\n\n\n\n\t\tSocial Harmony\n\t\tSwansea - Kenya Education Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaps\n\n\n\n\t\t\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nImages from Flickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrants\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGrant Start\tAmount\tTitle\tDescription\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMarch 2011\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t£2000\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSwansea – Liberia Community Linking Livelihoods Partnership Project\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe grant will part subsidise costs of forthcoming exchange  ...\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nDocuments\n\nNo Documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tManaged by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRheolwyd gan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn partnership with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMewn partneriaeth â\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFunded by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAriannwyd gan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEndorsed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCefnogwyd gan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n                                             \n                                                Contact Us\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t© 2012 Wales Africa Community Links\n\t\t\t\t\t\nManaged by Wales Council for Voluntary Action\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFunded by the Welsh Government\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDesigned & hosted by GloverSure Ltd.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n        \n\n\t",

The Nickalls edition. But the one I read now and I think is the best is the 1831 edition found in the first 2 volumes of George Fox Works (NFP 1990). \n\n\n\n\n\nGod Bless! \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Christian Friendship, \n\n\nThemis Papaioannou\n_________________\nChrist is our Lord, Saviour, and Friend.

The danger in this was demonstrated this morning as I sought to read a passage from one of Fox's epistles cited in another work.  I first looked in Jones' \"The Pastoral Epistles of George Fox\" and could not find the phrase I sought in the epistle referenced.  Looking then in \"The Works of George Fox\" (reprint of the 1831 edition), I discovered the phrase readily.  T. Canby Jones had snipped the very phrase I found important out of his edition, inserting an ellipsis instead.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it seems that some editors attempt to \"clean up\" their author's work by removing troublesome passages.  For example, it seems to me that Dean Freiday, editor of \"Barclay's Apology in Modern English\", has removed some anti-Catholic passages from Barclay's text that are not so in tune with today's more ecumenical world.\n\n\n\n\n\nModern editions, including modernizing vocabulary, punctuation, etc., can be helpful in introducing the new reader to an ancient author.  I would encourage those who are attracted to that author to make the transition to something nearer the original text as quickly as may be.  It can be more work, but it seems to me it offers a truer picture of the author's meaning as a reward.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have several editions of Fox's Journal, including an electronic version of the Rufus Jones edition that I can take with me as I travel; but in print I much prefer the Nickalls edition published by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting with permission of [then] London Yearly Meeting.  Joseph Pickvances' \"A Reader's Companion to George Fox's Journal\" is very helpful - I recommend it highly.\n\n\n\n\n\n--llw\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tsimonstl\n\n\n\nJoined: 09 Feb 2006\nPosts: 40\nLocation: Varna, NY\n\t\tPosted:  Thu Jul 20, 2006 1:19 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThe version in the Works was pretty severely edited by Thomas Ellwood and others.  I like it, but it's not exactly what Fox had in mind.  (Fox's telling is itself an editing of what happened.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a copy of the Nickalls' edition that I use as my main reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, I don't think there's much cause to go with a 'modernized' version of any of the Quaker writings.  The one thing that I do find useful is getting rid of the crazy bold and italic highlighting that seemed very popular in the 17th century.  I still haven't figured out what they were trying to do with it.\n_________________\nSimon St.Laurent\n\n\nhttp://lightandsilence.org/\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tShay\n\n\n\nJoined: 01 Jun 2005\nPosts: 885\n\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Jul 21, 2006 12:39 am?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tSpeaking as a woman- I know a lot of modern translations include, rather than exclude me- speaking of people rather than men, or talking about the right of humans rather than the rights of men (and depending upon when it was written- that's a rather important distinction!) and other such ideas. I don't have problem with works rewritten with that  sort of sensibility in mind. It really turns me off to read a book written by men, for men, and be expected to think of it as applicable to my situation. I feel left out of the conversation entirely sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would have to read the side-by-side printings of the old and modern journals to really know whether it would make a difference, which I haven't done as yet, but thought I would add that perspective to the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHehe- and I have the crazy writing there, sorry...\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tHarold\n\n\n\nJoined: 28 Jul 2005\nPosts: 136\nLocation: Kentucky\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Jul 21, 2006 11:19 am?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThat's an interesting point. It's common knowledge, I'd think, that phrases such as \"all men are created equal\" and \"the rights of man\" include women. When you consider that the word \"woman\" is formed from the word \"man\" (and that \"female\" is formed from \"male\"), this becomes more apparent.\n_________________\n\"The whole duty of humanity, from a Christian perspective is: To know God and to show God.\" -James Patterson\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tsimonstl\n\n\n\nJoined: 09 Feb 2006\nPosts: 40\nLocation: Varna, NY\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Jul 21, 2006 11:25 am?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tQuote:\n\tHehe- and I have the crazy writing there, sorry...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, but your use of bold actually makes sense, unlike, for example, Fox's use of bold and italic, not to mention Capitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the old books is really difficult because of this; fortunately, the 1831 printing of the Works, which is the one still readily available, spares us those extra complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Oh, and when they use bold, it's a bold typeface like blackletter.  Really hard to read!)\n\n\n\n\n\nFox tends to be telling a story rather than making abstract pronouncements, so I find his language less exclusionary than many, though no doubt there's still plenty of gender-specific language in there.\n_________________\nSimon St.Laurent\n\n\nhttp://lightandsilence.org/\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tShay\n\n\n\nJoined: 01 Jun 2005\nPosts: 885\n\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Jul 21, 2006 1:03 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\t\n\tHarold wrote:\n\t It's common knowledge, I'd think, that phrases such as \"all men are created equal\" and \"the rights of man\" include women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey certainly didn't when a lot of those works were written. To take a secular document for example- the Constitution of the United States uses male pronouns throughout a large part of the document- reflecting the fact that women were not considered full citizens or even partial ones at the time of writing. (Also presumably black males were not really The People, either.) I'm not saying I can't read it today as such, being able to vote and own my own property and even hold down a job, I'm just saying sometimes it's a barrier to full understanding if I have to wade through what is today sexist speech to get at the kernel of an idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I were to write something about the rights of women, how included would you feel? It's kind of the same thing. Of course, the rights of women (or men) are also the rights of men (or women) as we're all affected by what our brothers or sisters can or cannot do, but ultimately it's our shared humanity that is the connecting thread- something that I like to feel reflected in works dealing with the spirit. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW- female comes from the Latin femella, and male from the Latin masculus/mas- they actually have nothing to do with each other, linguistically speaking- we just like the congruent spellings in English!\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the original word man meant person, wifman meant 'female person,' and werman meant 'male person.' Male people taking control of most of the scholarly works, they started to drop the wer- and it became just 'man.' So yes, originally Man meant people, but most writers in less enlightened times were certainly not thinking of it that way- or else there wouldn't be so much about how women were the Downfall of Man or Man's helpmeet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is more a side note, it's an interesting one, you can check out some linguists (and armchair linguist's) thoughts on it:\n\n\nhttp://www.users.mpowernet.com/~kamals/man-gender.html\n\n\nhttp://www.grigaitis.net/articles/inclusive.html\n\n\nhttp://www.bentarz.se/me/03_970918.html\n\n\n\n\n\nsimonstl- Actually, I can read Blackletter pretty well- a lot of the books I learned German from still used it, and some modern German works still use it today, though more for effect than tradition. It is a beautiful-looking font that just screams \"Holy Stuff Here!\" but I agreee- it would be hard to read in a jumbled context!\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tLaurence17\n\n\n\nJoined: 25 Feb 2006\nPosts: 385\nLocation: U.K.\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Jul 22, 2006 12:37 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tVery, very interesting, Thanks.\n_________________\nAbwoon : divine progenitor, breathing mindfulness through poor in spirit and the resonating realm of ruach\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tBillSamuel\n\n\n\nJoined: 06 Aug 2002\nPosts: 772\nLocation: Silver Spring, MD, USA\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Jul 22, 2006 3:34 pm?? ?Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tOf course, even the first edition of the Journal was very heavily edited.

Piedfort coin struck by The Royal Mint cannot be overestimated, as collectors hurry to add this prestigious coin to their collection. It is also a tasteful and long-lasting keepsake of the Diamond Jubilee that will be treasured forever.\n\nThe eyes of the world will be on Britain in June 2012 when Her Majesty The Queen celebrates 60 years on the throne. Only one other monarch has reached this momentous milestone, her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, making it one of the most significant events in the history of the monarchy. To have reigned with such dignity and devotion to duty for such a long time is a wonderful achievement and The Royal Mint is proud to mark this once-in-a-lifetime occasion with an official UK £5 coin.\n\nMinted in sterling silver on double thickness blanks to the highest Proof quality and with a maximum mintage of just 3,250 pieces, the UK silver Piedfort coin features two new portraits of The Queen created especially for the Diamond Jubilee. Each coin is beautifully presented within a bespoke case and accompanied by a numbered Certificate of Authenticity.\n\nThe word ‘Piedfort’ comes from the French and can be translated ‘heavy measure’ and, indeed, Piedfort coins, double the thickness of their standard counterpart, can be traced back to twelfth-century France where they were used by the King as presentation pieces.\n\nDuring the reign of Queen Elizabeth II the first Piedfort coin struck especially for collectors came in 1982 with the introduction of the 20p coin. Today, they are among the most popular coins issued each year.\n\n \n\n                            \n\n\n                            \n                        \n\n\t\t              \n          \n\t\t            \n                \n                \n\n\t\t\t\t\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n\t\t        \n                \n\n\t\t        \n\t\t\n            \n\n\t        \n\t        \n\n\n    \n\t    Customer Reviews\n\n\t\t\n            \n        \n\t        Average Product Rating\n\n\t        \n\n\n    \n    Rating\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\t    \n\n        \n            \n\t        Average Service and Delivery Rating\n\n            \n\n\n    \n    Rating\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n                \n\t\t\t\t    This product currently has no reviews.

international artists will converge on the Southbank Centre next summer for its Festival of the World programme as part of the London 2012 Festival.\n\nInspired by the cultural vision of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Movement, Festival of the World will feature a number of exciting projects to celebrate the arts and its power to transform lives.\n\nAmong the highlights of the Festival are A Room for London, a unique one-bedroom installation in the form of a riverboat, situated on the roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hall.\n\nThe largest poetry festival ever staged in the UK, Poetry Parnassus, will also take place and see poets from each of the 204 competing Olympic nations come together in London for a week-long celebratory gathering.\n\nJude Kelly, Artistic Director of Southbank Centre, said: 'Pierre de \nCoubertin?s vision of a better world through education, culture and \nsport for all is as relevant today as it was at the end of the 19th \ncentury. \n'Festival of the World will be a space for artists and \nvisitors from around the world to enjoy a three-month celebration of the\n arts and its power to transform lives.'\n\nAlso among the events at the Southbank Centre will be Unlimited, a programme of commissions that celebrate arts and culture\n by disabled and deaf artists in the UK, which will run concurrently with the \nParalympic Games.\n\nFurther highlights of the programme include:\n\tAfrica Utopia, led by renowned Senegalese singer and human rights champion Baaba Maal, will shed light on areas where the continent leads the world,\n\tA performance by 150 dancers and 50 singers over the age of 60 in Dancing Voices.\n\tThe highly-anticipated return of Gustavo Dudamel and the Sim�n Bol�var Symphony Orchestra for a four-day Sounds Venezuela residency\n\tA celebration of the music of British composer George Benjamin and Southbank Centre Associate Artist, \nwith performances of seminal works over three concerts.\n\n\nAs the Games get even closer, the Southbank Centre will also play a part in the BT River of Music festival announced last week. It will host the Africa Stage adjacent to Jubilee Gardens, one of six stages showcasing music from each continent along the River Thames.\nRuth Mackenzie, Director, Cultural Olympiad & London 2012 Festival, said: 'We are proud to be working in partnership with Southbank Centre on world-class commissions for the London 2012 Festival.'\nRead the full media release\nFind out more at the Southbank Centre website\n\n\n     \n        \n            Related news\n\n            \n     \n                \n\n\n                        \n                            London 2012 Festival film programme announced\n    \n                            23 March 2012  \n                        \n\n                \n\n                        \n                            London 2012 Festival to showcase best of Brazilian culture\n    \n                            22 March 2012  \n                        \n\n                                \n                    Read more news\n                \n\n            \n\n        \n\n             \n        \n            On the blog\n\n            \n     \n                \n                        \n                            Performing at the Olympic Rings unveil was so special\n    \n                             5 March 2011  \n                        \n\n                \n                        \n                            Did we discover the next Cheryl Cole?\n    \n                            26 January 2011  \n                        \n\n                                \n                    Read more posts\n                \n\n            \n\n        \n\n        \n\n\nSee all News articlesGet email updates\n\n\n\n\n             \n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n             \n        \n     \n      Online shop\n  \n        London 2012 Union Jack cap�10.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Union Jack gymsack�8.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Union Jack gymsack�8.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Olympic Games Union Jack logo medium pin badge�6.00\n        \n\n        Team GB dynamic towel�18.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Olympic Games Wenlock mascot soft toy - 20cm�12.00\n        \n\n        Wenlock and Mandeville 20 cm soft toys set�23.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Olympic Games Union Jack Wenlock soft toy 25cm�15.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Team GB Pride the Lion soft toy - 20cm�15.00\n        \n\n        London 2012 Team GB boxed mug - white�5.00\n        \n\n\n     \n        \n                            \n            \n                Related photos\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        BAFTA winner Asif Kapadia at the Hackney Picturehouse\n\n                        \n                    \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        Jay-Z to headline Radio 1's Hackney Weekend 2012\n\n                        \n                    \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        Music Nation ?

Watch\n\n\t\t\n\n\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t       \t     \n\n\t\n\n                      They're an optimistic lot, the Germans. Rarely more so, in fact.  \n\n        Greece may be burning. Growth may be slowing. The talk elsewhere may be of a return to the 1930s.  \n\n        But the recognised German barometer of hope over fear shows far more Germans looking on the bright side than those down in the dumps.\n\n        According to the Allensbach Institute, which has tracked these things rigorously since 1949, 49% polled said they were hopeful of the future, compared with 17% who were fearful.\n\n        That's pretty well three smiles to every frown (with 26% showing some scepticism and 8% undecided).\n\n        Are Germans happy with the way they are being led? Yes, they are - very much so.  \n\n        On the latest opinion polls, two of every three Germans said Chancellor Angela Merkel was doing a good job. Three-quarters think she is taking \"correct and decisive action\" in the eurozone crisis.  \n\n        It's a glowing picture of satisfaction by the citizenry that stems from the economy. \n\n        Unemployment is falling. German exports grew more than 10% last year.\n\n        In 2010 and 2011, the economy grew at nearly 4% and last year at 3%, more than decent by European standards.  \n\n        Latest figures show that it slowed at the end of 2011. The indications are that this year it will grow by about 0.5% - measly by recent standards, but far from the recession expected elsewhere.\n\n  Thinking ahead\n\t\n  \n\n    Germany saw the potential of Chinese trade as early as the 1970s\n  \n\n      So what's behind the robustness? China, in a word. And \"manufacturing\", in another.  \n\n        The growth of China is fuelling demand by the Chinese new rich for BMWs and demand by Chinese factories for German machinery.\n\n        This isn't a fluke. German industrialists foresaw the potential of China when most others saw only turbulence and trouble.  \n\n        In October 1975 - 37 years ago, when China was in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution - the Financial Times described German policy towards the country: \"China could be the next growth market\".\n\n        Talk about long-term thinking. In ultra-unlikely circumstances - where Chairman Mao was excoriating capitalism and the new Chinese constitution talked of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" - German capitalists had identified the big new market:  the People's Republic of China.  \n\n  \n  \n\n    Angela Merkel may look stern, but her people are smiling\n  \n\n      \"The West German approach is typical of the very long-range view that German industry has taken,\" said the FT.  \n\n        \"At the heart of the approach lies the cultivation of a market, even if the short-term results are not over-encouraging.\"\n\n        Or take this from Die Zeit in the same year: \"The image which Germany is trying to project in the largest and most populous developing country in the world is not that of a major political power, but rather of the most important industrial country in the world, a country whose tool-making and mechanical engineering can compete successfully on the world market.\"\n\n        In 1975, British industry was in its perpetual state of crisis at the time, gearing up for what would be the general strike of the Winter of Discontent. The US economy was in recession. But German industrialists were thinking of China as the future.\n\n  Social goals\n\t      Why did they see it when others didn't?  Dr Olaf Ploetner of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin says that the key decisions were often taken by particular chief executives with vision, but they worked within a German framework of long-term views.\n\n  \n\tContinue reading the main story\t?Start Quote\n\nContribution to society is always a very important point?\n\n\nEnd Quote\n\tDr Olaf Ploetner\n\tESMT, Berlin\n\n\t\t\n      Firstly, German industry isn't particularly profitable.  There isn't that high a return in manufacturing, because making cars or machinery demands much costly investment and research and development.\n\n        Dr Ploetner told the BBC that this forces companies into looking far ahead. They live on a lower rate of profit, but for a longer period of solidity. \"It's interesting that they can exist for so long with small profits,\" he said, \"and this is to do with the owners.\"\n\n        Because a large part of German industry is family-owned, the short-term demands of shareholders, who want quick and relentless rises in the prices of shares, do not matter.\n\n        Many German firms, too, are owned by \"foundations\", often set up by the company's first generation of family founders.  \n\n        A foundation is an entity which owns something - like a company - but which is not owned by individuals.  \n\n        The Robert Bosch Foundation, for example, owns 92% of Bosch, the giant engineering company.  But the goals of the Robert Bosch Foundation are partly philanthropic, so it doesn't act as profit-maximising shareholders might.\n\n        As Dr Ploetner puts it: \"All the big companies are organised in foundations, and the foundations do not have 'return on capital employed' as their most important goal.  Contribution to society is always a very important point.\" \n\n        It doesn't mean that German companies are charities.  But it does mean that German companies are less easily swayed by the vagaries of the moment.  Combine that with a very decentralised economy, and you have the picture of solid and steady prosperity.\n\n  Hidden champions\n\t      If you go to virtually any German small town, there is a good chance that on the outskirts will be a middle-sized family firm which, in its own field, will be in the top three in the world. \n\n  \n  \n\n    Putzmeister concrete pumps are used all over the world\n  \n\n      That could be anything from making the cranes for docks, to the glue for embedding the different parts of credit cards together, to making bronze propellers for the world's biggest ships.\n\n        Or to making pumps for concrete.  But herein, perhaps, lies an omen. \n\n        Putzmeister is one of Germany's \"hidden champions\" - a company that leads the world in its niche.  \n\n        It was founded by Karl Schlecht near Stuttgart in 1958.  Schlecht designed a pump and then turned the idea into a company that went on to lead the market.\n\n        Karl Schlecht has just sold this German \"hidden champion\" - to a Chinese company. It has caused ructions among his employees, who are outraged because it came out of the blue. They protested outside the factory in Swabia.\n\n        And it's caused much angst beyond, too.  Germans wonder if their great success story is about to be completed - with a Chinese ending.\n\n             \n\t\n\t\n\n  \n  \n \t\n\t\n\tMore on This Story\n\n\t              \n\n\n\n\n\t\t     \n\t       \t               \n\n          \n       \t      Global Economy\n\t      \n\t      \n\n          \n            \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEurozone crisis explained\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSpain unveils 27bn euros of cuts\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Spain cuts 27bn euros ($36bn; ?22.5bn) from its budget this year and freezes public sector salaries to try to address its \"extreme\" economic situation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQ&A: Pain in Spain\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSpain 'has to bite the bullet'\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhat is the euro bailout fund?

In 'Typhoon' Conrad reveals, in the steadfast courage of an undemonstrative captain and the imaginative readiness of his young first mate, the differences between instinct and intelligence in a partnership vital to human survival. 'Falk', the companion sea-story, contrasts, as Conrad once put it, 'common sentimentalism with the frank standpoint of a more or less primitive man', a man with a conscience, however, about the girl he desires. In one of the 'land-stories' Conrad explores the utter isolation of an East European emigrant in England; in the other, the plight of a woman ironically trapped by the unwitting alliance of two retired widowers - each blind in his own way.\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\nSend this page to a friend\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n     \t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t? 1995 - 2011 Penguin Books Ltd\n\n?

          "ORAL HEALTH CHILD POVERTY IN THE LIGHT OF POSITIVE \nCONSENT \n \n \nChild Poverty ? Milestones and targets \nThe Deputy Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration requested that targets and \nmilestones be derived to measure progress in eliminating the effects of poverty on \nchild health.  In 2006, a range of targets were devised incorporating infant mortality, \nlow birth weight, childhood injuries, teenage conceptions and dental caries. \n \nTargets were based on quintiles of deprivation (initially using the Townsend index); \nby 2020 it was aimed to reduce the burden of ill health in the most deprived fifth to \nreflect levels of the middle fifth. Milestones for 2010 were devised, reflecting \nproportionate progress. \n \nFor dental caries there were four targets and four associated milestones (Table 1).  \nTwo targets were devised for five year olds using mean dmft (average number of \ndecayed deciduous teeth per child) and %dmft>0 (proportion of children with at least \n1 deciduous tooth affected by decay). Data from the survey of 2003-04 was used as \nthe baseline.  The remaining two targets were devised for 12 year olds using mean \nDMFT (average number of decayed permanent teeth per child) and %DMFT>0 \n(proportion of children with at least 1 permanent tooth affected by decay), with data \nfrom the survey of 2004-05 used as the baseline. \n \nIn 2009, Welsh Assembly Government requested that these targets be reworked using \nthe WIMD as the deprivation indicator.  Both WIMD 2005 and 2008 were used; the \nWIMD indicator which was contemporaneous to survey data collection was applied. \n \nFor child oral health surveys conducted in 2001-02 and 2003-04 WIMD 2005 was \nused to calculate the quintiles.  For the 2005-06 survey both WIMD 2005 and 2008 \nwere used.  For the 2007-08 survey WIMD 2008 used to allocate children to \ndeprivation quintiles. \n \n \n 1 \nThe effect of introducing positive consent to the surveys of five year olds on the \nchild poverty targets \nFor dental surveys of children conducted in school year 1 (approximately 5-years-old) \ncustom and practice underpinned by specific legislation (Education Act 1944 and later \nthe Education Reform Act 1996) meant that until 2005/6 letters were sent home to \nparents and children?s teeth would be examined unless parents had responded to \nletters refusing participation by their children. This was commonly referred to as \n?negative consent?.  In 2006 new guidance was issued to the NHS in Wales, England \nand Northern Ireland requiring positive parental consent used for dental surveys of \nchildren in school settings. \n \nTable 1 CHILD POVERTY TARGETS (original version derived using the Townsend index) \n \nDental caries in 5 year old children \n \nObjective: Improve the mean dmft and the %dmft>0 for the most deprived fifth of the \npopulation to that of the middle fifth of the population by 2020. \n \nBaseline: The mean dmft for the most deprived fifth of the population is 3.1 and for \nthe middle fifth it is 2.4 (2003-04).  Ratio 5:3 = 1.29. \n \nThe %dmft>0 for the most deprived fifth of the population is 61.8 and for the middle \nfifth it is 55.3 (2003-2004).  Ratio 5:3 = 1.12. \n \nTargets \n \nMean dmft 5 year olds: By 2020 the mean number of decayed, missing and filled \nteeth in those 5 year olds living in the most deprived fifth of the population will be 2.4.   \n \nPercentage of 5 year olds with caries: By 2020 the percentage of 5 year olds with \ncaries in the most deprived fifth of the population will be 55.3%.   \n \nMilestones \n \nMean dmft 5 year olds: By 2010 proportionate progress towards the 2020 target \nwould require a mean dmft of 2.9, being one third the required reduction by 2020. \n  \nPercentage of 5 year olds with caries: By 2010 proportionate progress towards the \n2020 target would require no more than 59% of children to have experience of dental \ndecay. \n \n 2Most deprived\nMost deprived\nMost deprived\nMost deprived\nSecond most\ndeprived\nSecond most\ndeprived\nSecond most\ndeprived\nSecond most\ndeprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nSecond least\ndeprived\nSecond least\ndeprived\nSecond least\ndeprived\nSecond least\ndeprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nThe changed consent arrangements resulted in participation of about 55% of children \ncompared with 85-90% in previous surveys. The potential problem of low response \nrates is non-response bias, the fact that non-responders may be different from \nresponders and that because they do not participate you cannot be sure just how \ndifferent they may be. Analysis of data collected before and after the changed consent \narrangements strongly suggest that a disproportionate number of parents of children \nwith decay have excluded their children from the 2007-8 survey which has impacted \non the reported dmft indices. \n \nThe impact of changed consent on monitoring \nThe reduced participation of children with decayed teeth has serious implications for \nthe monitoring of the Child Poverty Targets associated with the dental health of 5 year \nolds.  The child poverty targets were set using data from the 2003-04 survey.  We \nhave been able to monitor progress towards the milestone using data from the 2005-\n06 survey ? both these surveys were collected using negative consent.  The 2007-08 \nsurvey (and any future surveys) of five year olds used positive consent.  \n \nFigure 1: 5 year olds - mean dmft (-ve) surveys 2001-02 through 2005-06, mean \ndmft (+ve) 2007-08 \n \n3.40\n3.21\n3.20\n2.96\n3.00\n2.86\n2.79 2.80\n2.80\n2.65\n2.60\n2.43\n2.41\n2.40\n2.29\n2.20\n2.20\n2.07\n2.04\n1.90\n2.00\n1.81\n1.77\n1.80\n1.56\n1.56\n1.53\n1.60\n1.32\n1.40\n1.16\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0.40\n0.20\n0.00\n2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-\n02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 08\n \n 3\ndmftMost deprived\nMost deprived\nMost deprived\nMost deprived\nSecond most deprived\nSecond most deprived\nSecond most deprived\nSecond most deprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nMiddle deprived\nSecond least deprived\nSecond least deprived\nSecond least deprived\nSecond least deprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nLeast deprived\nFigures 1 and 2 present the average dmft and %dmft>0 by WIMD deprivation \nquintile.   Using the WIMD derivation the target would be ? to achieve an average \ndmft of 2.4 by 2020 for the most deprived quintile (N.B. this target was set using data \ngenerated from a survey using negative consent).  In 2007-08 (using positive consent \nmethodology) the average dmft for the most deprived fifth was 2.65. \n \nIf we were comparing data from surveys which used the same consent methodology \nthen this would look like we have surpassed the milestone for 2010 and are set to \nmore than achieve the 2020 target.  The same applies for the target and milestones for \nthe %dmft>0 (Figure 2). \n \nFigure 2:  Five year olds - %dmft>0 (-ve) surveys 2001-02 through 2005-06, \n%dmft>0 (+ve) 2007-08 \n \n \n70.00\n64.90\n65.00\n62.62\n60.53\n59.10\n58.52\n60.00\n57.56\n56.30\n54.80\n55.00\n52.87\n52.26\n49.90\n49.22\n50.00\n45.46 45.70\n44.14\n45.00\n41.30\n39.80\n39.22\n40.00\n37.90\n34.54\n35.00\n30.00\n25.00\n20.00\n15.00\n10.00\n5.00\n0.00\n2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-08 2001- 2003- 2005- 2007-\n02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 02 04 06 08\n \n \n \n \nIt is important to acknowledge the significant reduction in both average dmft and the \n%dmft>0 between surveys conducted from 2001 through to 2006 (using negative \nconsent) when compared with 2007-08 (using positive consent). \n \n 4\ndmft \nEstimating the impact of the change to positive consent \nCrudely looking at the average dmft in 2005-06 and comparing with the average in \n2007-08 there has been a 0.4 of a tooth reduction across Wales, ranging from 0.31 in \nthe most deprived quintile to 0.76 (i.e. ¾ of a tooth reduction) in the second most \ndeprived quintile.  We have not experienced such a large reduction in dmft in Wales \nbefore (Table 2). \n \nTable 2 A comparison of mean dmft for the surveys of 2005-06 and 2007-08 \n 5-05-06 5-07-08 Reduction in \nnegative positive dmft \nLeast deprived 1.56 1.16 0.40 \nSecond least deprived 1.90 1.56 0.34  \nMiddle deprived 2.29 1.77 0.52  \nSecond most deprived 2.80 2.04 0.76  \nMost deprived 2.96 2.65 0.31 \nWales as a whole 2.38 1.98 0.40 \n \n \nFurther, it is important to consider the ratio of the most deprived versus the least \ndeprived (Table 3).  The ratios for both mean dmft and %dmft>0, improved in 2005-\n06 and fell dramatically in 2007-08 ? suggesting a widening of the inequalities gap, \ndespite the reduction. \n \nTable 3 The ratio of most deprived versus least deprived for mean dmft and %dmft>0 \nacross survey years \n Least deprived Most deprived Ratio of most deprived: \nleast deprived \nYear dmft mean %dmft>0 dmft mean %dmft>0 dmft mean %dmft>0 \n2001-02 1.32 37.90 2.86 62.62 2.16 1.65 \n2003-04 1.53 39.80 3.21 64.90 2.10 1.63 \n2005-06 1.56 39.22 2.96 60.53 1.90 1.54 \n 52007-08 1.16 34.54 2.65 57.56 2.28 1.67 \n \nWe need to be careful how we communicate this beyond our specialist user group - \nbecause the data are open for serious misinterpretation.  We need to emphasise the \ndistinction between dmft (collected using negative consent) and dmft (collected via \npositive consent); that they are two separate indicators and that it is not possible to \nundertake any trend analyses - until we have new dmft data (collected via positive \nconsent methods) from future surveys. \n \n \nWhy it is important that we should set a new baseline using the 2007-08 data \nAnalyses have been undertaken to understand how the response rate varies, when \nusing the positive consent approach, according to social deprivation and caries \nexperience. There is sufficient bias to make direct comparisons with previous surveys \ninappropriate. In particular it is likely that those children with decay were less likely \nto participate, so reported indices will underestimate the true prevalence and severity \nof decay.  \n \nAs a result the data collected in 2007/8 cannot be compared with data collected up \nuntil 2005/6. Since we are unable to obtain any information on the children who were \nnot examined it is not possible to correct for non-response bias and produce an \nestimate of what data collected in 2007/8 would look like if previous consent \narrangements had been used.  Users of dental epidemiology data should not compare \nd mft data, collected using positive consent arrangements with d mft data which was \n3 3\ncollected using negative consent methodology. \n \nProposed new 5-year-old targets \nWe need to have a target for which we can monitor progress towards 2020.  If we \nrebase the targets to the 2007-08 survey ? we should have future survey data for \n11/12, 13/14, 15/16, 17/18, 19/20.  Admittedly the targets will be different.   \n \n \n \n \n 6 \nTable 4 Old targets and new target proposals for 5-year-olds \n Negative Consent Positive consent \nMost deprived fifth 2003/4 By 2020 2007/8 By 2020 \nMean dmft 3.1 2.4 2.65 1.77 \n%dmft>0 61.8% 55.3% 57.6% 44.1% \n \n \nFor the new target, based on 2007-08 data, the goal would be to achieve a dmft of \n1.77 for the most deprived group, who currently have an average dmft of 2.65 ? \ncompared with the original target, based on 2003-04 data, where the most deprived \ngroup were to achieve an average dmft of 2.4 by 2020 having an average dmft of 3.1 \nin 2003-04. Similarly the reported proportion of children with decay baseline and \ntarget (%dmft>0) need to be adjusted as outlined in Table 4.  \n \nDespite this reduction, both in the starting and the endpoints of the proposed new \ntarget (of approximately half a tooth) the inequalities slope is still evident and from a \npragmatic point of view we really don?t have an alternative. \n \nRECOMMENDATION: TO USE THE 5-07-08 DMFT DATA AS A NEW \nBASELINE FOR THE CHILD POVERTY TARGETS \n \n \n \nAuthors: Maria Morgan, Welsh Oral Health Information Unit and Nigel Monaghan, \nth\nPublic Health Wales.  10 March 2010 \n 7\n"]},

AlertMe, the Smart Home technology company, today announces that it has secured the contract to provide a Personalised Energy Efficiency Advice Service to British Gas customers in the UK who have new smart meters. The free service is being trialled with up to 10,000 homes during the summer and rolled out widely from the autumn.\n\nBritish Gas, which is the UK???s largest supplier of domestic energy serving 10 million homes and 15.9 million energy accounts, selected the AlertMe solution as a result of a competitive tender process. The partnership will mean that data from smart meters will be translated into valuable, personalised insights for British Gas customers that could help them to save millions on energy bills every year.\n\nSmart meters will be rolled out to all homes in the UK over the next seven years and are designed to provide the utility with up to date home energy consumption and billing information remotely without having to read the meter. For the first time this information will also be used to provide the customer with an easy-to-understand breakdown of their energy use, information on how they compare to other similar households and highly relevant, personalised, actionable recommendations on how to save energy and reduce their bills ???information that will prove invaluable with household budgets under pressure.\n\nAlertMe CEO Mary Turner says: ???This is a great opportunity to ensure that customers benefit from smart meters above and beyond just getting an accurate bill. We can take the smart meter information, put it in context and make the most relevant recommendations to help customers make simple decisions that can save them a lot of money.???\n\nThis deal marks AlertMe???s first large-scale roll out of ???Big Data??? services based on smart meter data to provide energy customers with unprecedented, relevant, personalised and actionable information. It also builds on the companies??? ongoing partnership to deliver Energy Saving and Smart Home services to British Gas customers in the UK. British Gas already provides customers with an AlertMe in-home energy display as part of its Energy Smart Tariff and will also be rolling out other services with AlertMe during 2012.\n\nDean Keeling, Managing Director of British Gas Smart Homes, says: ???This is a watershed moment for smart meters in Britain. Households are under financial pressure but personalised energy efficiency advice is another way of using smart meter data to help inform customers so they can take steps to cut their bills???.\n\nAbout AlertMe\n\nFounded in 2006, AlertMe is a Smart Home technology company providing home energy management and connected home services both directly to consumers and indirectly through partners such as Energy Utilities, Telecommunications companies and Retailers.\n\nBased on a single cloud-based platform and an AlertMe hub in the home, AlertMe allows consumers to monitor, control and automate a wide range of devices in the home, related to energy consumption, heating & cooling, home monitoring and new energy sources like solar PV, online and via their Smartphone anytime, anywhere.

Georgia Fisheries: Sigma Replacement Announced\nSubmitted by Falkland Islands News Network (Juanita Brock) 08.09.2006  (Article Archived on 22.09.2006)\n\nPharos IX will replace the SIGMA as a South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Fisheries Patrol Vessel.\n\n\nJoint Press Statement\n\n?\n\n\n?File: 1927_pharos 2.jpg \n\n\n\n\n\n?\n\nFPV Pharos IX\n\n\n\n?\n\nThe Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) and Byron Marine Ltd. are pleased to announce that the MV Pharos IX is soon to replace the MV Sigma as Fishery Patrol Ship for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. \n\n?\n\n\nThe MV Pharos IX has been purchased by Byron Marine Ltd. from the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses in Scotland and will be operated under a long term charter agreement with the GSGSSI. \n\n?\n\n\nThe Pharos IX is a more modern vessel than the Sigma and has a greatly increased logistical capability, including the ability to carry shipping containers. She has a fully operational helideck and is extremely manoeuvrable. She will therefore be able to complement her prime role of fisheries patrol vessel with other important tasks for the Government. \n\n?\n\n\nThe MV Sigma remains the property of Byron Marine Ltd but will no longer be on charter to the Government of South Georgia\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\t\nThis article is the Property and Copyright of Falkland Islands News Network.\n\t<< First <  Previous\tArticle 1 of \nwithin Shipping/Freight\tNext > Last >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t ? ? ?

(Excellent blog on many topics, BTW.) Her mother made one huge, enormously brave step, then otherwise fulfilled all of the gender norms.\n\nAnd of course it left me thinking of my Mum, and how different she was. \n\nMum, when I was a small child kept the house spotless ? and even ironed our underpants, something I finally talked her out of doing when I was in my early teens ? but absolutely hated doing it. She did it because she thought she had too.\n\nAnd she was a dreadful cook, a job she also hated. In my memory ? although I?m sure this wasn?t actually true ? every meal consisted of cheap steak fried to the consistency of leather, lumpy mashed potatoes and frozen corn and peas. It is no wonder Kraft macaroni cheese was my favourite meal.)\n\nWhat Mum would really have liked to do ? at least in my early youth ? was drive racing cars. She once, famously, beat a famous Australian racing driver in a hill climb, and I suspect given the opportunity she could have been very good. Of course, however, that wasn?t going to happen ? indeed I can?t even think of a female racing driver today.\n\nAnd what she gave me, above all, were two things:\n\n1. A determination to do my own thing. She hadn?t been able to escape to independence, but she wanted to ensure I had every opportunity to do so. (She was probably five years too young. The middle Sixties in Australian suburbia were still ?the Fifties? in cultural terms, and a young woman with little education striking out on her own would have been almost unimaginable ? and economicly probably extremely difficult, if not impossible.)\n\n2. She refused to put any burdens on me; to make any claims on me. She consciously and explicitly didn?t demand payment for the sacrifices that she?d made for me. Mum thought emotional blackmail was a hideous thing. (An awareness of this issue makes me wonder about these career women who ?give it all up for the children? ? so beloved by the media. What will they ask of their kids in return?)\n\nP.S. I was reminded in writing this post of a lovely blog I found via Tim Worstall?s Britblog roundup this week. Super Woman?s Super Blog is written by a manager of a newsagency in ?in a desolate seaside town? in the UK. And, reading between the lines, she was the total driving force in it raising more than ??1,000 for charity. \n\nIt reminds me too of Mum?s work in various school Mothers? Clubs. Their members did all the work for fetes, tuckshop rotas and similar, but when it came to visiting dignitaries etc, the males who headed the Parents & Citizens Association would be trotted out to collect the glory.\n\n Stumble it! \n  Digg\n  reddit   Del.icio.us\n\t\n\n Posted   in  Miscellaneous?(Tuesday November 1, 2005 at 2:33 am) \n\n\n\n\n\t- 0 Comments\t\n\n\n\nNo comments for In praise of mothers ?\t?\n\n\n\n\tNo comments yet.\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t   Name (required)\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t   e-mail (required but not published)\t\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t   website\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t\n\nRSS feed for comments on this post. \n\tTrackBack URI\n\n\n\t\n\t  \n\t\n\n\t\n Notify me of follow-up comments by email.\n Notify me of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\nblog advertising is good for you\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nTwitter Updates\n\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n     About Me:\n\n     \t\n\tNatalie Bennett: I'm a writer and journalist based in London, and a Green Party activist, so you'll also find me on the Camden Green Party blog.\nI was the founder of the Carnival of Feminists, and am a books editor on Blogcritics.org.

The last week has demonstrated that yet again. \n\n        Three sessions of gains have all been built on the back of comments made by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. In a question-and-answer session last Thursday, he said the ECB would do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro, then added, \"Believe me, it will be enough.\" \n\n        Those last few words hinted that the much spoken-of big bazooka might be unveiled. The expectation is that the bank will buy the government bonds of Spain and Italy, forcing down their costs to stave off a full-blown bail-out. \n\n        Mr Draghi's comments were followed by what seemed an orchestrated chorus. Over the following days, the leaders of Germany, France and Italy all chimed in and said they would do what it took to protect the euro. \n\n        On Monday, Chancellor Merkel's spokesman was quizzed as to what these statements meant. \n\n        He replied that it was  \"the intention of all simply to send a very strong signal for the euro\".\n\n        If that is all this flurry of activity amounts to then disappointment will surely follow. \n\n  US pressure\n\t      Only Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro group, has hinted there might be a wider strategy out there. \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n    \n        \t\t\n        \n            \n                                \n                                Please turn on JavaScript.

He promised results but then added \"it still has to be decided what exactly we will do when\".\n\n        US President Barack Obama did not disguise his impatience. \n\n        \"I don't think ultimately that the Europeans will let the euro unravel,\" he said at a fundraiser in New York, \"but they are going to have to take some decisive steps...\n\n        \"I am spending an enormous amount of time trying to work with them... The sooner they take some decisive action, the better off we're going to be.\"\n\n        So the expectation is that the central bank will buy government bonds of Spain and Italy. \n\n        There is a meeting of the ECB's governing council on Thursday. The bank has intervened before. More than 230bn euros (£180bn; $282bn) were deployed but with limited impact. \n\n        The German Bundesbank is still opposed to such actions. The intriguing question is whether the Merkel government is softening its opposition. \n\n        Germany, as always, is the key. Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy points out: \"The panic in Spanish and Italian bond markets stems mainly from fears that Germany is unwilling to commit itself to the level of debt mutualisation required to keep the single currency project alive.\" \n\n        Dr Spiro maintains that without German support, any ECB-backed measures will lack credibility in the eyes of the markets.\n\n  Beyond vanity projects\n\t      What a move by the bank cannot do is to address the fundamental issues of debt and a lack of growth.\n\n        The Spanish economy, which declined 0.4% in the last quarter, seems trapped in a cycle of decline. Only rising exports offer hope.\n\n        A Spanish minister opined that Germany should help Spain much as it was helped by the Marshall Plan. \n\n        The differences, however, are not lost on Germany. The Marshall plan was deployed to rebuild Europe after the devastation of war. Spain's debt - as we now know - arose from the vanity projects of places like Valencia, the ghost airports, the savings banks run by local politicians and a wild housing boom.\n\n        It is why Angela Merkel remains cautious. Her mantra is no extra liability for the German tax-payer without greater control over budgets. \n\n        And that brings us back to the ECB. She and her advisers recall what happened last summer. The ECB intervened to buy Italian bonds. Within days Silvio Berlusconi had rowed back on his promises to make savings and introduce reforms.\n\n        So the ECB can buy time, important time, but bond-buying alone will not fix the crisis.\n\n             \n\t\n\t\n\n\t         \n        \n\n       \n      \n       \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tArticle written by Gavin Hewitt\n\t\t\tGavin Hewitt\n\t\t\n\t\tEurope

It draws on survey work, visits and correspondence with those responsible for the collections. \n\n\n\n\t\nCollection surveys describes two collection-based surveys and their findings \n\n\n\t\nCollection profiles presents brief profiles of the individual collections, drawing on the surveys, visits and additional information \n\n\n\t\nRecommended strategies recommends strategies for addressing selection, copyright, de-duplication, and the scheduling of the collections, based on information in the preceding sections. \n\n\n\nSee the project workflow section to see how these activities fit within the overall project work plan and workflow. \n\nCollection surveys \n\nSurvey of format and condition of pamphlets \n\nThe format and condition of the pamphlets will have an impact on: their selection (e.g. item may be too fragile to send); handling considerations; time required to scan (e.g. number of pages, tightness of binding); and the quality of the OCR output achieved (e.g. use of unusual typefaces). \n\nIn preparation for the initial project proposal, contributing libraries were asked to provide information about the size and condition of their collections. Libraries supplied a total number of pamphlets for their collections. Total page numbers were then estimated by multiplying the number of pamphlets by an average of 25 pages per pamphlet (for 3 collections) or 35 pages per pamphlet (4 collections, who said their average would be higher than 25). Based on these calculations, the initial project bid estimated that 1 million pages (the BOPCRIS capacity for this project) would approximate 30,000 pamphlets. \n\nAs part of the scoping work for the revised project proposal, a survey was undertaken to collect more accurate page statistics and determine other factors likely to affect scan time and image or OCR quality. \n\nMethodology \n\nLibraries were asked to check a random selection of 100 items drawn from the collections chosen for inclusion in this project. In five cases a computer program was used to generate this selection from lists supplied by the libraries; in two cases (Durham and UCL) the sampling was made on a systematic basis by library staff, but without sight of the pamphlet or its title. \n\nEach library was asked to check a range of characteristics, such as size, location, condition of binding, and presence of greyscale or colour illustrations. These criteria were drawn up by Julian Ball (BOPCRIS Manager) and the author. They were based on experience and some initial testing in Southampton (see Digital datasets). \n\nThe following criteria were chosen for the format and condition survey: \n\n\t1. Overall condition (i.e. would the library be happy to send for scanning) \t10. Number of pages with grey illustrations \n\t2. Location (i.e. open shelves, on-site store, on-site archival, off-site store, off-site archival) \t11. Number of pages with colour \n\t3. Whether bound or separate \t12. Presence of foldouts (i.e. intentional foldouts) \n\t4. If bound, whether volume opens flat to 180° \t13. Presence of folded pages (i.e. folded to fit into a volume) \n\t5. If bound, whether volume has loose boards \t14. Presence of adverts \n\t6. If separate, whether there is margin stitching (i.e. additional stitching to hold sections together) \t15. Presence of annotations \n\t7. Whether loose pages \t16. Gothic or other unusual typeface used as main body text \n\t8. Whether obviously missing pages \t17. Existence of multiple copies \n\t9. Number of pages \t18. Closest size (to A5, A4 or A3) \n\n\nA copy of a page from the survey form is included as Appendix A. Questions 1-18 on this form relate to this survey and follow the order of the criteria listed above. As the survey began it became clear that some collections included significant proportions of non-English language pamphlets, so libraries were additionally asked to gather this information. This was not always possible where the survey work was already underway. \n\nThis survey was undertaken during 4-11 August, with some libraries spending up to 10 hours on it. This time was provided as a partner contribution to the scoping study. \n\nResults \n\nThe tables below provide findings from the format and condition survey.

Durham's sample included some 20th century items and other forms of publication, which may account for the larger sizes. \n\n\nDiscussion \n\nSome care needs to be taken in drawing conclusions based on this survey, since only 100 (or less) items were assessed from each collection. For the smaller collections (Durham and Liverpool) this represents 6 or 7% of the collection; but for the larger collections (LSE and Bristol) it is less than 1%. Nonetheless, it provides better information than the previous estimates and enables some profiling to be done. Should the project go ahead it would enable some of these statistics to be checked and would provide an indication of how accurate and useful this approach to characterising collections is. \n\nCollections profiles provides a brief profile of each collection and highlights characteristics identified by the condition survey that are likely to impact upon scan time. These and other factors noted in that section have influenced the scheduling of the collections (both their order and allocation of time). \n\nOne of the most important findings from the survey was that the page averages for these collections was much higher than the 25-35 previously estimated. Because the project had set the number of pages to capture at 1 million (the BOPCRIS capacity for this project), this meant reducing the overall number of pamphlets we would expect to capture. The revised bid recalculated each collection's page numbers based on the averages found in this survey (see Table 2.2.1:A above for averages). When combined with a reduction for anticipated duplication (see next section), this reduced the overall number of pamphlets from nearly 30,000 to just over 23,000. Table 2.1.2:B, below, presents new estimates for each collection. Note that because selections are to be made from the LSE and Bristol the numbers of pamphlets from these two collections were adjusted until 1 million pages was achieved. \n\nSurvey of duplication across collections \n\nPublished pamphlets are not unique items and with seven contributing libraries some level of duplication is to be expected. It is important for the project to gauge the extent and pattern of that duplication in order to determine: (a) the best place within the workflow to de-duplicate, (b) the best order in which to scan the collections, and (c) the likely reduction in number of scanned pamphlets due to de-duplication. Estimates of duplication from those familiar with this material ranged from 20%-60% (across Copac as a whole), so a more accurate measure was required. \n\nMethodology \n\nIt was hoped that duplication could be gauged by an automated means using the CURL or Copac databases. This did not prove possible due to the existence of multiple records and the lack of time and resources to develop suitable tools for comparison. A part of the work of MIMAS in Work Packages 3 and 8 of the project (see 4.3 below) will be to develop such tools to enable all libraries holding a pamphlet that has been digitised to be provided with links. In the absence of an automated means, the same 100 item sample used for the condition survey (Collection surveys above) was checked by libraries against Copac for duplicates: (a) across the six other libraries contributing to Phase 1 and (b) against all holdings on Copac. This check was included as questions 19 and 20 on the survey form (see Appendix A). \n\nThe duplication survey took place alongside the format and condition survey, during 4-11 August. In some libraries the same staff members completed both surveys; in others, special collections staff undertook the format and condition survey (questions 1-18) and cataloguing staff undertook the duplication survey (questions 19-20). Checking 100 records on Copac took up to 6 hours for some libraries. This time was provided as a partner contribution to the scoping study. \n\nResults \n\nThe table below presents findings from the duplication survey. General discussion is provided in this section, with comments relating to individual collections discussed in Collection profiles below. \n\nTable 2.1.2:A Duplication survey results (based on questions 19 and 20 of survey form) \n\n\t\nCollection \n\t\nUnique on Copac \n\t\nDuplicated within any partner library \n\t\nDuplicated within individual partner libraries \n\t\nDuplicated within any non-partner libraries \n\n\t\nBristol \n\t\n23% \n\t\n32% \n\t\nLSE (19%); Manchester (10%); Liverpool (6%); Newcastle (3%); Durham (1%); UCL (0%)1 \n\t\n70% \n\n\t\nDurham \n\t\n41% \n\t\n40% \n\t\nLSE (20%); Bristol (19%); Manchester (18%); Liverpool (4%); Newcastle (4%); UCL (1%)1 \n\t\n53% \n\n\t\nLiverpool \n\t\n24% \n\t\n45% \n\t\nBristol (28%); LSE (24%); Manchester (16%); Durham (4%); UCL (2%)1; Newcastle (0%) \n\t\n61% \n\n\t\nLSE \n\t\n37% \n\t\n40% \n\t\nUCL (22%)1; Bristol (13%); Manchester (9%); Durham (5%); Liverpool (3%); Newcastle (3%) \n\t\n50% \n\n\t\nManchester \n\t\n44% \n\t\n21% \n\t\nBristol (10%); LSE (8%); Liverpool (5%); Newcastle (2%); Durham (1%); UCL (1%)1 \n\t\n55% \n\n\t\nNewcastle \n\t\n25% \n\t\n44% \n\t\nBristol (28%); LSE (18%); Liverpool (8%); Manchester (8%); Durham (2%); UCL (0%)2 \n\t\n61% \n\n\t\nUCL 1 \n\t\n32% \n\t\n28% \n\t\nLSE (12%); Manchester (10%); Bristol (4%); Durham (3%); Liverpool (3%); Newcastle (1%) \n\t\n57% \n\n\n\n\nNote 1. There has been a delay in loading some of UCL's records into the CURL/Copac databases, so the duplication with its collection is not fully represented here. UCL's records will be loaded before the project commences. \n\n\nDiscussion \n\nAs previously mentioned, care needs to be taken in drawing conclusions based on this survey, since only 100 (or less) items were assessed from each collection. Nonetheless, it provides better information than previous guesses and enables some estimation to be done. Should the project go ahead it would enable the accuracy and usefulness of this approach to be evaluated. \n\nBetween 56 and 77 percent of these collections were found to be duplicated within at least one of the other 23 libraries represented on Copac. However, this still leaves a significant amount of material that is unique to each of these collections (23-44%). \n\nBetween 21 and 45 percent of the pamphlets in these collections were found to be duplicated within at least one of the other 6 libraries taking part in Phase 1 of the 19th Century Online Pamphlets project. However it is important to note here that the collections being digitised are a subset of each library's 19th century pamphlet holdings. For example, Manchester's Foreign and Commonwealth collection only represents about 21% of its total estimated holdings of 19th century pamphlets on Copac (17,000). So the 10% of UCL's Hume Collection found duplicated with Manchester's holdings is unlikely to equate to a 10% duplication for this particular project. \n\nThere is a fairly high level of duplication with the LSE and Bristol, which have large 19th century pamphlet collections (an estimated 15,989 and 22,150, respectively, on Copac). However, the project intends to make a selection from these two collections rather than capture them in their entirety, so the overlap with these collections can be compensated for in the selection process. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that the records for UCL's 19th century pamphlets are not yet fully loaded onto the CURL and Copac databases. It is likely that there is higher duplication with this collection than is apparent in the survey. UCL expect to have their full records on Copac before the project start date (January 2008). \n\nFor the purposes of putting together the revised bid we have assumed a duplication of half of the total amount found 'duplicated within any partner collection' for the Durham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and UCL collections and reduced the number of pamphlets we expect to capture accordingly. It may be that this reduction is larger than is necessary and we would seek to refine these estimates as the project proceeds. As selections are being made from Bristol and LSE, their numbers were not reduced for duplication, but were adjusted upwards to compensate for the reduction across the other collections, in order to make the collection up to 1 million pages. \n\nThe table below shows the combined effects of the higher page averages and the reductions made to account for duplication. Although it is hoped that this is closer than the previous estimates, it is likely that further adjustments will need to be made as the project proceeds and the numbers of pamphlets may rise or fall. \n\nTable 2.1.2:B Effects of higher page averages and reduction for duplication \n\n\t\nPartner Library \n\t\nCollection \n\t\nEstimated pamphlets \n\t\nEstimated pages \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\nInitial bid \n\t\nRevised bid \n\t\nInitial bid \n\t\nRevised bid \n\n\t\nUCL \n\t\nHume Tracts \n\t\n4,200 \n\t\n3,528 \n\t\n147,000 \n\t\n148,881 \n\n\t\nDurham University \n\t\nEarl Grey Pamphlets \n\t\n1,450 \n\t\n1,160 \n\t\n36,250 \n\t\n75,478 \n\n\t\nUniversity of Liverpool \n\t\nKnowsley Pamphlet Collection \n\t\n1,560 \n\t\n1,209 \n\t\n39,000 \n\t\n51,745 \n\n\t\nUniversity of Newcastle \n\t\nCowen Tracts \n\t\n1,974 \n\t\n1,579 \n\t\n49,350 \n\t\n45,796 \n\n\t\nUniversity of Manchester \n\t\nForeign & Commonwealth Pamphlets \n\t\n3,662 \n\t\n3,149 \n\t\n143,000 \n\t\n109,281 \n\n\t\nUniversity of Bristol \n\t\nNational Liberal Club Pamphlets (selection) \n\t\n8,500 \n\t\n6,250 \n\t\n297,500 \n\t\n284,375 \n\n\t\nLSE \n\t\nPamphlet Collection (selection) \n\t\n8,500 \n\t\n6,250 \n\t\n297,500 \n\t\n285,000 \n\n\t\nTotals \n\t\n29,846 \n\t\n23,125 \n\t\n1,009,600 \n\t\n1,000,556 \n\n\n\nCollection profiles \n\n\n\nThis section provides profiles for each of the seven collections, including overviews of the collection content and a list of significant points that emerged from the surveys, or from visits and discussions with collection contacts. All collections were visited during the scoping study. \n\n\n\nPreferences for transportation, insurance, storage, scheduling of collections, and other issues, were discussed with collection managers during the visits or by correspondence. In addition to specific issues included in the profiles below, several points can be made here that apply to all or most of the collections: \n\n\tCollections were presented with the option of doing their own scanning for this project, but all are happy to use BOPCRIS as a consortia scanning service \n\n\tEveryone was happy with the suggested transport arrangements (HarrowGreen, Momart or equivalent) and most preferred the transport company to pack the pamphlets \n\n\tEveryone was happy with the level of insurance cover provided by the transport firms we asked to quote (minimum of £100,000 per consignment) and by BOPCRIS whilst on premises (minimum of £100,000) \n\n\tEveryone was happy with the storage conditions being offered by BOPCRIS, which is temperature controlled, has low ultraviolet levels and is only accessible by authorised personnel \n\n\tNo one said they would require the return of original items from BOPCRIS if requested by users whilst away: each would notify users of their collection's absence and be happy to make do with photocopies or digital images (if already scanned) from BOPCRIS \n\n\tCollections will have the option to receive digital datasets relating to their own items (images, metadata and OCR), but few intend to take up this option within the life of the project (Durham, Manchester and possibly UCL) \n\n\n\t\nUniversity of Bristol \nNational Liberal Club Pamphlets (selection from this collection) \n\n\t\nThese pamphlets are from the libraries of, amongst others, Charles Bradlaugh, John Noble, the Liberation Society, the Land Nationalisation Society and the Cobden Club. There are also many individual items given by W.E. Gladstone and other prominent politicians. The collection is especially strong on 19th century commerce, economics, finance, politics, religion and sociology. It includes publications by and about not only the Liberal Party, but also the Conservative and Labour Parties. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tAlthough this is a liberal club collection, its inclusion of other party pamphlets will provide a good political representation \n\n\tCollection is largely held off-site (83%) which is likely to slow the selection \n\n\tCollection contains a lot of separate pamphlets (92%) which is likely to slow scanning \n\n\tThere is a high proportion of in-margin stitching (18% of the separates) which will slow scanning and may affect the quality of imaging (due to page bowing) \n\n\tThe high proportion of separates means the collection may be useful in replacing poor quality copies bound into other collections (we note the high duplication of other collections with Bristol) \n\n\tThe proportion of bound volumes is small (8%), but there may be difficulties capturing these because of the tightness of binding (63% of bound volumes cannot be opened flat) \n\n\tBristol have no particular timing issues, but the collection will need to be broken into consignments because of the volume and the added time required for selection \n\n\tThe bulk of the Bristol material should be staged towards the end of the project to fill gaps and replace poor duplicates \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nDurham University \nEarl Grey Pamphlets (all 19th Century pamphlets from collection) \n\n\t\nThis is a family collection accumulated largely by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earls Grey. Charles was Foreign Secretary in 1806-1807 and Prime Minister 1830-1834. Henry George was Under-Secretary for Home Affairs in 1830, Under-Secretary for the Colonies in 1830-1834, Secretary at War in1835-1839 and Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1846-1852. Albert Henry George was Administrator of Rhodesia in 1896-1897 and Governor-General of Canada in 1904-1911. The Greys were strongly interested in parliamentary reform, colonial affairs and Catholic emancipation. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe Earl Grey Pamphlets collection is not owned by Durham but on loan from the family. Lord Howick, the current owner, has given permission for the collection to be included within the project \n\n\tThe condition survey found surprisingly high page averages (65), greyscale counts (16% of pamphlets, 4.2% of pages), and larger sized items (44% were nearer to A4 than A5). Unfortunately the survey was skewed by the presence of some 20th century material and some books, journal issues, and official publications within the sample (these form part of the Earl Grey collection). With this material excluded, as this project would do, the number of items will drop to about 1,250 and these statistics would be likely to change \n\n\tNone of Durham's pamphlets are bound, but are all held separately in archive boxes, requiring special storage and handling and slowing the scanning \n\n\tThere is a reasonable proportion of in-margin stitching (13% of items) which will slow scanning and may affect the quality of imaging (due to page bowing) \n\n\tAlthough not asked for in the survey criteria, the person completing the form for Durham noted that 7 items (out of 94) contained uncut pages. Southampton will need to cut these pages for scanning or seek duplicates (Durham have approved cutting) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nUniversity of Liverpool \nKnowsley Pamphlet Collection (all 19th Century pamphlets from collection) \n\n\t\nThis is a family collection, reflecting the careers of the Earls of Derby. Edward George was successively Irish Secretary (1830-33), Colonial Secretary (1833-34 and 1841-44) and three times Prime Minister (1852, 1858-59 and 1866-68). His career was summarised by Disraeli as follows: \"He abolished slavery, he educated Ireland, he reformed parliament\". His son, Edward Henry, 15th Earl of Derby (1826-1893) was Colonial Secretary and later Indian secretary in his father's administration of 1858-59. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe Knowsley collection is 100% bound in volumes which are uniform (consistent binding, pages trimmed to size) and open easily, factors which could speed the scanning process \n\n\tHowever, a large proportion of these pamphlets (47%) are in volumes with loose boards, which will require special care and handling and the use of a specialist scanner \n\n\tAlthough there is high duplication, this is largely with Bristol and LSE and so can be avoided through the selection and de-duplication processes \n\n\tThis collection would need to be scheduled in 2007, because collection is due to be wrapped for building work in 2008 \n\n\tLiverpool would prefer that the collection goes after Easter, since the first part of the year is the busiest for this material, but will be flexible \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nLSE \nPamphlet Collection (selection from this collection) \n\n\t\nThis collection includes a comprehensive set of material from political parties, including election manifestos and political cartoons. Issues in British political history include the corn laws, land question, Church and state and home rule for Ireland. There is a wealth of material on the co-operative movement, including the Cooperative Women's Guild, and from long-standing pressure groups such as the Fabian Society and organisations which have long disappeared such as the Cobden Club, the Imperial Federation Defence Committee, the Poor Law Reform Association, the Workhouse Visiting Society and the Liberty and Property Defence League. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe LSE pamphlet collection is 100% bound, which is good for scanning but not so good for selection - we will try to select by the volume \n\n\tThe condition survey suggested that a high proportion of pamphlets might not be available for scanning due to their condition (7%), but this can be avoided through the selection process \n\n\tThere are a high proportion of foreign language pamphlets, but this is also likely to be avoided through the selection process (which with focus on UK debates) \n\n\tWork is planned for the store where the pamphlets are housed in either 2007 or early 2008 - this will fit well with the project because LSE needs to be scheduled late in the project in order to pick up duplicates and fill gaps around other collections \n\n\tAs this is a larger collection, it will need to be broken into consignments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nUniversity of Manchester \nForeign & Commonwealth Office Pamphlet Collection (all 19th Century pamphlets from collection) \n\n\t\nThis collection is on deposit from The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). It comprises two earlier collections. (1) The Foreign Office pamphlet collection, consisting largely of pamphlets acquired by British ambassadors overseas and sent back to London as being of value for the formulation of policy. This collection is rich in material from South America (where the British government was the formal arbitrator in boundary disputes), the Near East (both the last century of the Turkish Empire and the growth of Zionism) and the various great European \"Questions\", from the Congress of Vienna through to the aftermath of the creation of the German Empire. (2) The Colonial Office pamphlet collection, consisting chiefly of local imprints including, e.g., unique early Australiana. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office pamphlet collection is not owned by the University of Manchester but is on loan from the FCO. Permission has been obtained for the collection to be included within the project \n\n\tThe larger Foreign Office component in this collection is bound (71%) and often in tight binding (28%), which will require special scanning \n\n\tThe smaller Colonial Office component is unbound, but were held in folders with pillars, which have occasionally punched through the text - this might necessitate replacement with duplicates, if available \n\n\tA very large proportion of the separate pamphlets also have in-margin stitching (45%), which will slow scanning and may affect the quality of imaging (due to page bowing) \n\n\tDuring the visit, many older font styles were found (e.g. long s's, diphthongs, and ligatures) - these will require the use of specialist OCR software \n\n\tThere is a high proportion of foreign language material (23%), including non-Latin scripts (1%). Specialist OCR software will be required for foreign languages, but cannot recognise the non-Latin pamphlets. \n\n\tThis collection contains a higher proportion of foldouts and (consequently) colour pages than other collections - these will require specialist scanning \n\n\tThere is a high proportion of annotations (10%), which will require greyscale scanning \n\n\tThere is a higher proportion of unique items than others, so there is less reduction for duplication, but also less chance of finding replacements for poor copies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nUniversity of Newcastle \nCowen Tracts (all 19th Century pamphlets from collection) \n\n\t\nThis is a personal collection of Newcastle-born Joseph Cowen (1829-1900), Member of Parliament (MP) and social reformer. On his father's death in 1873, he was elected in his place as MP for Newcastle and, though he came into conflict with both the Parliamentary and local Liberal parties, he remained MP for Newcastle until he retired in 1886.The Cowen Tracts date, in the main, from Cowen's active years of the late 1840s to early 1880s, though there is some earlier and later material. The topics covered largely reflect his main interests of social, educational and economic issues. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe Cowen collection is 100% bound (in three types of binding) and will generally open flat (3% will not) \n\n\tThere are some potential issues with loose boards (15%), which will require special care and handling and a specialist scanner \n\n\tThere is a high proportion of annotations (9%), which will require greyscale scanning \n\n\tThere are some unusual typefaces (4%) which will require use of special OCR software \n\n\tNewcastle is happy for the collection to be done in one consignment and there are no particular timing issues \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nUCL \nHume Tracts (all 19th Century pamphlets from collection) \n\n\t\nThis is the personal collection of Joseph Hume (1777-1855), Radical Member of Parliament. Its broad subject-matter reflects the major political, economic and social developments and reforms taking place in Britain in the early part of the nineteenth century, and includes some of the causes championed by Hume during his parliamentary career, such as universal suffrage, Catholic emancipation, a reduction in the power of the Anglican church and an end to imprisonment for debt. \nSee more information about the collection \n\n\t\nKey points emerging from surveys, visits and correspondence \n\n\tThe Hume collection is very well bound (100%), with no loose boards or issues with opening flat \n\n\tA very high percentage of the pamphlets are annotated (43%), which will require grey or colour, take longer to scan, and may pose some OCR issues \n\n\tThere are some personal items (e.g. letters) bound between pamphlets - these will be excluded from the project \n\n\tThe collection contains a high proportion of fold-outs (9%), which will require specialist scanning \n\n\tThere is a low level of duplication with other partner libraries suggesting this is a fairly unique collection \n\n\tThe entire collection is pre-1855, so there are no copyright issues for this collection. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe key points identified for these collections have influenced the proposed scheduling. \n\nRecommended strategies \n\nDuring the scoping study we focused on four issues of particular importance in ensuring a good selection and flow of pamphlets to BOPCRIS for scanning: (1) selection of material; (2) addressing any copyright issues; (3) addressing the duplication across the collections; and (4) the scheduling of the collections for scanning. This section presents strategies for dealing with each of these issues. These would be firmed up in the project plan and further amended as necessary once the project was underway. \n\nSelection strategy \n\nAs stated in the outline, an aim of this project is to provide users with a wide selection of pamphlets that focus on the political, social and economic issues of the 19th century. Instead of just digitising 23,000 pamphlets relating to this theme (which could have been achieved through a combination of two of the larger collections), this project has chosen to focus on capturing as much as is possible of a number of smaller collections associated with individuals or families (Durham, Liverpool, Newcastle and UCL) or organisations (Manchester), and to supplement these with pamphlets drawn from larger collections (Bristol and LSE). There are several advantages of capturing whole collections: \n\n\tIn addition to understanding the motivation of pamphlet producers , users will be able to appreciate the motivations of their collectors . As seen in the format and condition survey above, some of these collections include significant levels of annotation by their collectors. \n\n\tAlthough these collections have a political, economic or social focus, they include material relating to the wider interests of their collectors, providing a good overview of the whole pamphlet literature. \n\n\tThe collections can be linked with the collection-level descriptions in the online Guide to 19th Century Pamphlets; and found in collection-based searches. \n\n\tBy including a larger number of library collections within this project, the workload is spread, the benefits are shared more widely (e.g. digital copies for libraries), and more can be learned to support the extension of the project to other collections in later phases. \n\n\nDe-selection criteria \n\nFor five collections, then, the appropriate strategy is not a selection strategy, but a de-selection strategy. Although the goal is to capture as much as is possible of these collections, the project anticipates de-selecting some pamphlets from digital capture, for these reasons: \n\n\tThere are copyright concerns (see Copyright strategy) \n\n\tThe pamphlet was published outside the bounds of the 19th century (either earlier or later). We note that extending into the 20th century would greatly increase copyright issues. \n\n\tThe pamphlet has already been captured or is better captured from another collection (see De-duplication strategy) \n\n\tThe pamphlet is too fragile to send for scanning. \n\n\nNote that the project will not be deselecting on the basis of difficulties in scanning or OCR. BOPRIS has specialist scanners that can capture any material a library is willing to send. \n\nSelection criteria \n\nFor the remaining two collections (Bristol and LSE), a positive selection of pamphlets will be made and will be based on the following criteria: \n\n\tTheir relevance to themes of the great 19th century debates (e.g. universal suffrage, relationship of church and state, colonial policy), as identified by the collection curators, and the academics and teachers involved in the management and steering groups. \n\n\tTheir usefulness in addressing gaps in the digital collection (e.g. themes not well covered, formats not represented, particular authors who should have a voice). Again, these gaps will be identified by curators, researchers and teachers. \n\n\tFeedback and demand from collection users : the bulk of Bristol and LSE material will be selected later in the project, by which stage there will be material available online and the possibility of tracking usage and surveying users. \n\n\tReplacements for copies held in the smaller collections that are in too poor or fragile a state to scan. \n\n\nCopyright strategy \n\nCopyright is the primary IPR issue facing a 19th century collection of published pamphlets. Although these collections are owned by their libraries (or have been included in the project with owners' permission), this ownership or permission does not automatically give libraries a right to copy them. For most of the pamphlets copyright will have expired and there will be no barrier to copying. But it is anticipated that a small proportion of the late 19th century material within these collections will still be within copyright and require either permission or exclusion. Project partners have some experience in these issues, but the project will seek advice during Work Packages 1 and 2. \n\nWe expect to identify three classes of material: \n\n\nClass 1. Items clearly out of copyright (based on their age or anonymity) \n\nClass 2. Items potentially within copyright due to age but of unknown status (e.g. because the death dates of the author or identity of their inheritors are not easily discoverable) \n\nClass 3. Items known to be in copyright (based on age or the known dates of the author) \n\n\nThe following approach may be adopted: \n\n\tLibraries can send any Class 1 materials without concern \n\n\tLibraries must make the decision whether to send any Class 2 materials and bear the full responsibility for this decision: the project will expect them to make efforts to determine its status and require them to provide a suitable indemnification (this will form part of a Memorandum or Understanding) \n\n\tLibraries must not send any Class 3 materials for scanning without obtaining appropriate copyright clearance. The project will provide some assistance to libraries, including a suitable licence. \n\n\nThe following diagram shows a possible workflow for determining a pamphlet's copyright status. \n\nFigure 1 Suggested Copyright Workflow \n\n \n\n*This is a conservative cut-off - the project will seek legal advice on this. \n\nNote that this chart assumes a conservative cut-off publication date of 1857 (150yrs) in case of an uncertain death date. We are aware of other projects who are using 120 years (i.e. 1887) as their cut off and will seek advice on this during the initial stages of project planning. It is anticipated that the vast majority of pamphlets in this collection will belong to Class 1. Many of the pamphlet records checked on Copac include dates for their authors, which will assist in determining the pamphlet's copyright status. \n\nIf, despite this strategy, issues arise with any of the pamphlets, the project would seek to remove it from the digital collection. \n\nDe-duplication strategy \n\nAs the duplication survey above has indicated, there is likely to be some duplication across these collections, although it is difficult to gauge the exact extent. \n\nBecause the project is selecting from the two larger collections (Bristol and LSE) there is an opportunity to de-duplicate these at the selection stage - provided there is some means of catching duplication when the selection is being made. \n\nThere are several approaches that might be taken to de-duplication for the smaller collections: \n\n\tDo not de-duplicate This may make sense given the focus on individual collections and the level of annotations of some pamphlets. However, this must also be balanced against the project's aim to create as large and accessible a selection of pamphlets as possible. Where there are a handful of personally annotated copies in different collections, the occasional duplicate may be permitted. But as a general policy, the approach of ignoring duplication would lead to wastage and reduce the number of unique resources that could be captured and delivered. \n\n\tDe-duplicate at library, before sending for scanning Advantages of de-duplicating at the library are that pamphlets are not handled, transported, and removed from circulation unnecessarily. Disadvantages in de-duplicating at the library are that a comparison between different copies will not be possible, and the library going first in the queue will have more of their collection scanned than those following. There needs to be some mechanism for the LSE and Bristol to select around the other collections, so a database tool developed for this purpose could also be used to manage de-duplication between the smaller collections. \n\n\tDe-duplicate at BOPCRIS, before scanning This approach has the advantage of enabling a comparison between physical copies. However, this would require that a pamphlet is kept until its duplicate arrives, which will take up space, delay return (and possibly require additional transportation). It would also require some means of identifying that the pamphlet has a duplicate in another collection. \n\n\tDe-duplicate at BOPCRIS, post-scanning This approach was suggested in the initial bid, before the extent of duplication was explored. Although this does not require the originals to be held at BOPCRIS, it does assume that the appropriate datasets can be easily retrieved and compared. This may not be the case if BOPCRIS is sending the data to JSTOR and then deleting it from its own storage system (BOPCRIS does not have the resources to hold the entire digital collection at once). This approach also leads to great wastage, since one of the duplicate pair has been handled, transported and digitised unnecessarily. \n\n\nThere is no perfect solution to de-duplication. However, as a result of this scoping study the recommended strategy is to de-duplicate at the library, prior to sending the item to Southampton (Option 2). Library partners have agreed to this approach. It will require some sort of system (e.g. database) to identify duplicates among the smaller collections and enable the LSE and Bristol to make their selections with the other collections in view. \n\nSystem to manage de-duplication \n\nThe project proposes that a database be developed at the beginning of the project ( see WP3) and maintained by a Project Officer located at BOPCRIS. We would expect to populate this database with simple bibliographic records exported from library OPACS or CURL/Copac at the beginning of the project. The database records would include additional fields to, for example, log the status and condition of the pamphlets. \n\nAs a library prepares its collection (or selection) it searches the database and identifies any duplicate records in other collections. It then checks the status of these items. \n\nA pamphlet record can have one of several statuses: \n\n\tNot checked - the default; for items that have not yet been checked or selected from a collection \n\n\tMissing - pamphlet could not be found \n\n\tNot suitable - pamphlet is too fragile to send \n\n\tSent - pamphlet is waiting to be sent or in transit \n\n\tReceived - pamphlet is at BOPCRIS and awaiting scanning \n\n\tScanned - pamphlet has been scanned and is awaiting signoff and return \n\n\tReturned - pamphlet has been returned \n\n\tDuplicate - not sent \n\n\nIf the librarian finds a duplicate with a status of 1-3, then the item should be sent (unless that library's own copy is also missing, not suitable or in poor condition). If another copy has a status of 5-8, then the item should be returned to its place on the shelf (or ignored within the volume) and the appropriate status recorded in the database. \n\nSome libraries may still wish to check their duplicate for any significant annotations and make a case with the project team for a duplication. \n\nThe following diagram shows a de-duplication workflow based on the suggestions above. Note that it makes reference to a record slip. It is recommended that such a slip accompany all pamphlets to be scanned, and include details of the library name and catalogue ID number and other information. This will be particularly useful in marking which parts of a bound volume are to be scanned. The project would supply a record slip template and recommend that it be printed on an acid-free or PH-neutral paper. \n\nThe diagram below shows how de-duplication might be achieved within the library workflow using the proposed database. \n\nFigure 2 Suggested De-duplication Workflow \n\n \n\nStrategy for scheduling collections \n\nThe Gannt chart below sets out a possible scheduling of collections for digital production at BOPCRIS (see WP5). The time allocations take into account the size of the collections (i.e. number of pages) with some adjustment for its condition, based on the profiles in Collection profiles. The ordering of the collections is also influenced by the key characteristics identified in Collection profiles. We have tried to avoid the preparation of material overlapping or there being more than three libraries' pamphlets at BOPCRIS at any one time. \n\nWe have indicated single consignments for the smaller collections and two consignments each for the larger collections, although some of the smaller collections may also be broken in half or sent as two van loads. The collections we are doing in their entirety are scheduled earlier, and those from which selections are made (LSE and Bristol) generally occur towards the end of the schedule. This will enable the selections to be more informed and to minimise duplication. It will also enable the project to adjust the numbers from LSE and Bristol to ensure that the 1 million page target is met. \n\nIt must be stressed that this is one possible scheduling for the collections. Should the project go ahead the timetable would be negotiated with library partners. \n\nFigure 3 A scanning schedule \n\nSee the scanning schedule \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n\t\n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Browse JISC by...\n\n        \tAccess & Identity\n\tAccessibility & Inclusion\n\tAdmissions\n\tAssessment\n\tBusiness & Community Engagement\n\tCommunities\n\tCourse Management\n\tData & Text Mining\n\tData Services & Collections\n\tDigital Libraries\n\tDigital Preservation & Curation\n\tDigital Repositories\n\tDigitisation\n\te-Portfolios\n\tEvaluation\n\tGreen ICT\n\tImage, Video & Audio\n\tInstitutional ICT\n\tInteroperability\n\tLearner Experience\n\tLearning & Teaching Practice\n\tLearning Environments\n\tLearning Resources\n\tLegal & Ethical\n\tLifelong Learning\n\tMobile Learning\n\tNetwork & Infrastructure\n\tOpen technologies\n\tPersonalisation\n\tPlagiarism\n\tResearch & Innovation\n\tResource Discovery\n\tStaff Development\n\tStandards\n\tTools & Techniques\n\tWeb 2.0\n\n\n    \n\n    \t©\n            2012\n            Jisc|\n\tAccessibility| \n\tSite map|\n        \n\tGlossary|\n        \n\tPrivacy|\n\tJobs|\n\tFreedom of Information|\n\tMobile site\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Our funders:\n\n        \n\n        \n            \n                    \n        \n\n        Last updated on 01/05/09 by Lisa Clifford\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Fontsize disabled - Your browser does not support JavaScript\n\n    \n\n\n    \n   \n    \n\n   ",

They should have had. Their failure to have been supplied with them is a massive indictment of the present government.\n\n                           \n\n                           \n                                                      \n                              Instead of focussing on its prime duty of defending the realm and its inhabitants from aggression, the government  has preferred to squander precious tax revenues on all manner of other politically correct frivolities. \n\n\nAs to the two reports themselves, their problem is that so much concerning the bombings is currently sub judice due to up-coming trials as to render them near useless as a sources of full and authoritative information about the bombings. \n\n\nBy way of illustration, the reports claim the four bombers acted alone. Yet, because of  up-coming trials, neither says a word in comment about the significance and implications of the fact the bombings occurred on the day Abu Hamza had been due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on terror charges. Nor about the video the gang?s leader, Mohammed Sidique Khan, made shortly before to which was added a message from Al Qaeda?s second-in- command, Ayman al Zawahiri, before being released on al-Jazeera. Nor about the will he made that had apparently been modelled on one left by a British born-born al-Qaeda guerrilla killed in Tora Bora. \n\n\nNo, let us for the time being draw a veil over this appalling tragedy and the very limited information about who was behind it or might be to blame for not having done more to  prevent it. \n\n\nInstead, let us focus on another recent news item that should really be receiving far more attention from politicians and the mainstream media than it has but which appears to have passed them by without having elicited from them so much as a stifled yawn. \n\n\nLast Monday, President Mahmood Ahmadinejad of Iran sent President George Bush a conciliatory little missive. Basically, in accordance with what passes as  best practice according to the version of the religion to which the Iranian President adheres,  it offers President Bush the Hobson?s choice of the following alternatives: his money, his life or to join the Iranian President?s gang by converting to Islam.  It ends wth a closing salutation in Arabic the English translation of which runs: 'Peace only unto those who follow the true path.' (Hat-tip to lgf and through them to Robert Spencer for pointing this out and the Islamic theology behind the letter.)  \n\n\nThis is an offer President Bush has no choice but to refuse. \n\n\nSince it is one Muslims of the Ahmadinejadian variety have traditionally regarded themselves as enjoined by their religion to make before being licensed by it to engage in warfare against some infidel people, in effect President Ahmadinejad?s letter amounts to a declaration of war against the American people. \n\n\nThat it was has arguably been confirmed by a subsequent comment the Iranian President made in clarification of the letter yesterday in Jakarta where he is currently on a visit. (hat-tip: Jihad Watch) There he said of his letter to Bush: \n\n\n'The letter was an invitation to monotheism and justice, which are common to all divine prophets. If the call is responded [to] positively, there will be no more problems to be solved'. He added ominously that Bush's response to his letter will determine the future.  \n\n\nIs it all bluster on Ahmadinejad's part, just his playing to the gallery of Muslim world-opinion as he struts around the global stage, or does it represent a genuine threat that should be taken very seriously? \n\n\nWell, as they say, you pays your money and you takes your choice. \n\n\nMine is to take the letter very seriously as a declaration of war. \n\n\nRadical Islamists such as he are nothing if not reliably devout when it comes to their religion as they understand it. \n\n\nAs has been pointed out in connection with the letter, Osama bin Laden made a similar formal declaration of war against the US in 1998 three years before September 11th, and subsequently made a similar offer to the American people in an open letter he wrote them in November 2002. \n\n\nThe only silver lining in this ominously gathering (Mushroom?) cloud is the knowledge that Ahmadinejad?s increasing stridency is apparently directly proportionate to the ever-increasing domestic unpopularity of his regime. \n\n\nI seem to recall that the post-September 11th overthrow of the Taliban regime was greatly facilitated by the active participation of a home-grown opposition movement, albeit one that had been carefully nurtured by the US. There are signs of something similar beginning to happen in Iran. \n\n\nOne reason it has proved so hard for the US and its allies to win the peace in Iraq has been that no alternative government there lay ready to hand after the overthrow of Saddam and has his regime, as was available in the case of Afghanistan and would be in the case of Iran. \n\n\nLast week, it was reported by the US conservative weekly, Human Events, that Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah of Iran, told its reporters in an excusive interview 'that in the next two to three months he hopes to finalise the organisation of a movement aimed at overthrowing the Islamic regime in Tehran and replacing it wth a democratic government'. \n\n\nLest you wonder how a supposedly democratically elected regime, such as the present Iranian one purports to be,  could be replaced by another truly democratic one, it is worth bearing in mind the words recently attributed to another recent Iranian exile, Amir Abbas Fakhraver. According to a report in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph, the Amir told its reporter Simon Scott Plummer that: \n\n\n'referral of Iran's nuclear dossier to the UN Security Council had been a cause of street celebrations in the [Iranian] capital and other major cities. And the riot police had not dared intervene. Such was the hatred of the regime... that people were prepared to put up with economic sanctions, including an oil embargo, and even military strikes, if they led to its overthrow.'    \n\n\nI am hoping, therefore, that President Ahmadinjejad makes good his threat to show up at the World Cup in Germany. His arrest there, which would be more than justified under international law on a variety of different counts, would certainly make the much needed regime change in Iran all the more easy.  \n\n\nSuch regime change there would almost certainly significantly reduce, if not altogether bring to an end, the current insurgency in neighbouring Iraq, as well as the current turmoil in other Middle Eastern trouble-spots, most notably Gaza and the West Bank. It would also hopefully curb the associated turbulence back home in Britain where a second university lecturers? union, NATFHE, is on the war-path again against Israel by calling for a boycott of its universities on behalf of Britain's intelligentsia, if not, mercifully, British intelligence. The latter have much better ways of using their time than have the British academics, as today's reports about the London bombings make all too painfully clear.\n\n                           \n\n                                        \n                           \n                        \n\n                        \n                           \n                                                                  Posted by David Conway on May 12, 2006 10:44 AM\n                               \n                               \n                            \n                           | Permalink\n                        \n\n                     \n\n\n                     \n\n                                          \n                                                                                 \n                                 Comments (2)\n\n                           \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          JayN:\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          \"Get Russia and China to change their tune\"\n\n\nGosh, I wonder why nobody else has thought of that? \n\n\nWhile it is certainly true that without permanent security council backers Iran and indeed Iraq, Sudan, etc, etc, would be/ have been, much easier to deal with. It's a bit glib to throw this out as something that is simple, or even achievable. As we continue to see France, Russia and China seem wedded to prevarication, anti-americanism and acting in national interest, irrespective of the potential cost to human life in other nations. Whether this is right or wrong, a reflection of other nations behaviour or not, is irrelevant. In terms of what you are suggesting there is no fundamental way, not argument, nor coercion, nor bribary, for the US, UK or anyone one else to 'make' them change their behaviour. This means that the UN is a non-starter for any significant statements/ actions with regard to Iran, Sudan, etc. It seems sensible therefore to look for other routes to achieve our aims.\n\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          Posted by\n                                          JayN  |\n                                          May 17, 2006 11:00 AM\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          Posted on\n                                          May 17, 2006 11:00\n                                       \n\n                                    \n\n                                 \n\n                           \n                                                   \n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \n                                       \n                                          Dave Harris:\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          Iran's stance towards the west should not come as a surprise, nor should Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's letter to Bush be anything of a revelation to those who have followed proceedings in the Middle East.\n\n\nIran has continually called the bluff of anti-proliferation states, and continues to do so.  The hawkish approach of the head of state is merely a continuation of this attitude and his self-belief in his right to be able to do so without sanction.\n\n\nIf we are to ascribe to the view that it is unacceptable for Iran to enrich Uranium (whether or not for the purposes of developing weaponry), then those that ultimately need persuading of the threat are those in the UN Security Council (China and Russia) who are currently blocking moves by the UN to attempt to enforce sanctions.\n\n\nOnly if pressure is brought to bear by those countries currently upholding Iran's right to defy the IAEA and to remain in breach on the non-proliferation treaty to change Iran's stance will Ahmadinejad feel as though his policy is unsustainable.  With backing from Russia and China (even implicitly), Iran's leadership will feel justified in maintaining their atomic ambitions, and there will be little in the way of repercussions, simply because the Security Council will not be in a position to intervene.\n\n\nThat is the threat to \"the west\".  Provokation by Iran might well lead the US and their allies into further military action independently of the UN, which would be both rash and unjustifiable given the UN's lack of action, as it was in Iraq.  Get Russia and China to change their tune, and we will find that Iran has to back off too, lacking the support for their deliberate defiance of international protocol.\n\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          Posted by\n                                          Dave Harris  |\n                                          May 12, 2006  3:58 PM\n                                       \n\n                                       \n                                          Posted on\n                                          May 12, 2006 15:58\n                                       \n\n                                    \n\n                                 \n\n                                                         \n\n                           \n                        \n\n                         \n                        \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                              Post a comment\n\n                              \n                              \n                                 \n                              \n                                                                  \n                                    Because we are deluged by spam all commenters need to provide an email address.

Having passed through the House of Lords, the Bill is expected to get a first commons reading towards the end of February. \n\nAfter a Second Reading, the Bill will pass into Committee Stage, where potential amendments around abortion are likely to be proposed from both pro choice and anti abortion parliamentarians. \n\nOpposition to the current Abortion Law will be led by Nadine Dorries MP, who will propose reductions to the current 24 week abortion limit. It is also likely that mandatory counselling for women seeking abortion, as well as an enforced waiting period before a procedure (to give women a chance to fully consider the implications of a termination) will be proposed. \n\n?Marie Stopes International strongly opposes any lowering of the current time limit for abortion,? said Liz Davies, Director of UK and Western Europe Operations. ?A reduction would make the lives of the very few women seeking a later term procedure extremely difficult. \n\n?We must recognise that there will always be a need for later terminations, as a proportion of women, through no fault of their own, either do not recognise symptoms of pregnancy or have no reason to suspect that they could possibly be pregnant at all if, for example, they are regularly using a modern form of contraception.? \n\n?As a society we should be supporting women and respecting their right to choose what they consider to be in their own best interests and the interests of their existing families and their unborn child, not condemning them or calling for measures that would limit their options and cause real hardship.? \n\nIt is anticipated that Pro-Choice MPs will seek to introduce amendments to improve access to abortion. There may be calls to remove the requirement for two doctors? signatures to allow an abortion to proceed. Additional proposals might include amendments to allow easier access to medical abortion by ensuring that the first pill can be given by a qualified practitioner, and then allowing women to complete the procedure by taking the second pill at home. \n\nThus far, anti-abortion lobbying in the House of Lords to bring about changes to current legislation has proved unsuccessful. On January 28th, the first vote on an abortion amendment to the Report stage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill took place in the House of Lords. \n\nThe amendment, tabled by Baroness Masham of Ilton, would have removed the right to abortion on grounds of fetal abnormality. The proposed amendment, which was the first serious attempt to change the law for 17 years, was defeated by 89 votes to 22. \n\nMarie Stopes International will continue to report on the bill?s progress through the House of Commons. \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    ?\n\n    \n\n\n\nRelated categories:\n\nAbortion\n\nAdvocacy & campaigning\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            \n\n    \n        Related News\n    \n\n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        CEO highlights importance of family planning in reducing unsafe abortion\n\n                    \n                        Commenting on research released today our CEO Dana Hovig reaffirmed the importance of family planning in lowering the number of unsafe abortions across world. 19/01/2012\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n                \n                    \n                        2011: a year in sexual and reproductive health\n\n                    \n                        We take a wider look at what proved to be a pivotal year in sexual and reproductive health globally, and a look forward at 2012. 30/12/2011\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n                \n                    \n                        How do you use drama to teach people about family planning?\n\n                    \n                        Through a partnership with Africa Directions, MSI Zambia is successfully educating women so they can access the full range voluntary family planning and legal safe abortion services we offer in their communities. 31/10/2011\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n                \n                    \n                        Global Impact Report launched\n\n                    \n                        We have launched our Global Impact Report 2010 today.

More than 500 jobs were lost. Many more jobs that depend on Vestas will follow. This makes no sense from a green or a labour perspective!\n\n\n\tAt the same time, the government announced a major expansion of renewable energy including wind power. We are calling on the government to intervene to save jobs at companies like Vestas - through nationalisation if that is what it takes - to show that it is serious about saving the planet.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhat you can do\n\n\n\tHardship fund for sacked and redundant Vestas workers\nSend a donation from your trade union or other organisation, or make a personal donation. Cheques payable to RMT IOW 2 Vestas hardship & defence fund, and send to Keith Murphy, 57 Well Street, Ryde, IOW PO33 2RY.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n Actions & meetings\n \n\t\t\t\tWednesday 17 February\n\tNEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT 7pm, Save Our Services public meeting, called by Unison, but open to all who want to campaign against the proposed cuts to council and all jobs and services.

Located on the top two floors and roof of a seven story car park in Peckham, the view is fairly epic, and since the temporary gallery space is complemented by having Frank's Cafe and Campari Bar strapped onto the building it is a pleasure to be in the space itself. Specially appointed by the Curatorial Council, the 15 large-scale new works by international artists commissed for the space, take central stage.\n\n\n\nIn fact the drama of the site offers a particular challenge to the artists, this is far from the ideal 'white cube' situation of the contemporary gallery. The artworks must stand under a low ceiling or the open sky, surrounded by the raw surface of the concrete and framed against a panorama of all the prominent London skyline, competing with the Gherkin, the Shard, the London Eye, all only a couple of kilometres away.\n\n\n\nIn this case then, the first idea in both the artists and the curators minds must be, 'let's go big!, 'let's go rugged!', and so-on. In previous years this has been the case, with sculptures on giant plinths, and a diving board like structure (Theo Turpin) installed on the roof that could be climbed upon so that visitors could get an even higher perspective. This year there is an element of this approach, in some cases more successful than others. With some of the objects on display there is a slight feeling that they aren't benefiting from the situation, they just seem a little insubstantial in this setting. A good example of this effect is the two huge (3m perhaps) inflatable rats that stand on the roof facing each other. One slowly deflates while the other inflates, to a soundtrack of an overblown love song pounding out of some speakers. In a usual wall bounded gallery space, these giant horrors would be overpowering, here they maintain some effectiveness, but the power is undoubtedly dimmed.\n\n\n\nHowever, one shouldn't dwell overly on this difficulty; elsewhere in the exhibition the setting fits the work extremely well. Ripper Teeth by James Capper takes a group of great sharp hooks, teeth and claws from digging machinery and displays them on light-box plinths, huge, heavy and dangerous looking. These are located under the low hanging roof of the car park, and spread out, using the scale of the space to good effect. This piece is linked to several others in the show by certain motifs, such as machinery and danger, and certain materials, such as steel. The show is not billed as having any theme, but on viewing all the artworks it becomes apparent that the selection is not completely unrelated.\n\n\n\nUp on the roof, The Price of Danger, by Camille Henrot, an aeroplanes wing has been dissected so that the internal structure is displayed.  In a piece by David Brooks several fork lift trucks lift and break sections of a winding wooden track – so we have machines being dissected and also doing the damage themselves. Another instance is Bettina Pousttchi's contribution, AHEAD ONLY, a collection of apparently real steel bollards, polished to the most insanely shiny point possible. This surface effect draws attention to their less than perfect shapes, since they have been bent and twisted in a way that is quite common for bollards out on the street, but here in this stylised scenario, the forces necessary to do the damage take on a different aspect, as the violence of the distortion is juxtaposed with the extreme attention that has been paid to polishing the objects clean.\n\n\n\nIt seems as though the curators have been deliberately gathering together work that has a definite shared fascination with the industrial, the mechanical, the dangerous and the hard sharp qualities of metal. This occurs even in some of the more restrained pieces. Eva Berendes' work Untitled (Osaka) takes some of the primary forms that are familiar from sure influence Sol Le Witt, triangles, semi-circles, and the three step triangular ziggurat shape, and renders them in sheet steel. The same material is used by Lilah Fowler in tube:fencing (their lowercase) this time cut and laid flat on the floor or against the wall. \n\n\n\nThe game of looking for connections and oppositions is part of the appeal of a group show such as this, but it is far from the whole story, other work that don't fit so comfortably alongside the other pieces still make valuable contributions to the visit. In particular (Untitled) Harvest Architecture by Michael Dean. This is perhaps the easiest work in the show to miss, as he has hidden it in the cracks of the architecture and piled in dark and dusty corners of the carpark. The work is a small paper back book, with no text, and lots of blank pages. The pages that do carry and image show folded prints of photographs of the space itself. First wrapping and restructuring the building into images, then into sculptures, back into images and finally placed via the books back into the gallery. Through his convoluted but reflective process, Dean has found a quiet but ultimately masterful way to get the upper-hand in this challenging location.\n\n\n\nAside from the main exhibition, an exploration of the Bold Tendencies website will reveal a great season of events and film showing continuing up until the end of the show. \n\n\n\nBold Tendencies continues until 30 September. \n\n\n\nboldtendencies.com\n\n\n\nAesthetica Magazine\n\nWe hope you enjoy reading the Aesthetica Blog, if you want to explore more of the best in contemporary arts and culture you should read us in print too.

All in Order, with Exceptions is a chronological survey of Solakov’s practice, an amalgamation of four selections, made by three galleries - Ikon (UK), S.M.A.K. (Belgium) and Serralves (Portugal) - comprising one work per year since he emerged as an artist c.1980. There are overlaps, where a work was chosen by two or more curators. The ‘exceptions’ are those works first exhibited in years following their years of production, the latter being ignored for our purposes. In addition, for the Fondazione Galleria Civica, Trento, Solakov has made a further selection from all the works not chosen for the three other galleries: All in (my) Order, with Exceptions is a kind of Salon des RefusÃ©s, which articulates an intimate approach to the survey format, fully autonomous from curatorial ‘interference’. \n\n\n\nThe vast body of work available for consideration is evident in archival folders, painstakingly put together by the artist, which document hundreds of works by him not chosen to show on this occasion as well as pertinent facts relating to each year in question. At once very personal and encyclopaedic, this is the world according to Nedko Solakov, coloured by a characteristically melancholic sense of humour. \n\n\n\nIn 1988, Solakov was a key figure in The City?, a seminal exhibition staged in Sofia shortly before the fall of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Local artists worked together to propose new ways of making and experiencing art, creating installations that were cleverly critical of the status quo. Some of Solakov’s paintings made around this time - with their tendency towards story-telling and figuration - were sometimes confused with a Soviet-sanctioned style, yet in retrospect they can be seen as completely consistent with the candid self-deprecating approach that informs his practice as a whole. For example, Fear (1987), with its isolated passenger in the belly of a jet plane, beautifully embodies the artist’s own fear of flying. The broad economical brushstrokes have a cartoon-like quality that becomes very familiar in Solakov’s later drawings and watercolours. \n\n\n\nTop Secret (1990) epitomises the emotional honesty and knowingness inherent in Solakov’s work and also catapulted him to fame. Shown at the height of Bulgaria’s political unrest, it comprises an index box with cards inscribed to communicate his ‘shameful secret’, the fact that he had collaborated with the Bulgarian secret police as a youth during 1976-1983. He stopped voluntarily and no publicly known documents exist relating to the artist’s involvement (22 years after the political changes in Bulgaria, in general the files remain closed). Made without coercion of any kind, Top Secret was a cathartic gesture: a means by which Solakov voluntarily unburdened his ‘hurting heart’, yet also funny and intelligent in its execution. Other works from the late 1980s, including My Conscience Tormenting Me (1988), a painting of the artist wracked with guilt, are as excruciating in their disclosure. \n\n\n\nAfter Top Secret, Solakov’s work developed an expressive range, perhaps exemplifying the complex freedom that his country now enjoys. Paintings and drawings now take their place alongside photographs, readymades and other sculptural pieces, performance, video and installation.  This ‘narration into 3D space’, as the artist puts it, extends to remarkable uses of exhibition space: the 2006 work Toilets will be recreated at Ikon, a piece that involves humourous inscriptions on and around fittings in the ladies and gents lavatories. \n\n\n\nSolakov’s later work incorporates its environment to the degree that the two become one-and-the-same, with the visitor implicit: we are the people in an art gallery looking at Studies for Romantic Landscapes with Missing Parts (2000), and are the subjects of the artist as we encounter A-Kitschy-Market-Somewhere-in-Eastern-Europe Stories (2001). In this way, All in Order, with Exceptions is a masterstroke. It constitutes a life of the artist - an autobiography - that we have the privilege to walk through, an autobiography that engages and implicates us. \n\n\n\nAll in Order, with Exceptions opens on 21 September and runs until 13 November. \n\n\n\nikon-gallery.co.uk\n\n\n\nAesthetica Magazine\nWe hope you enjoy reading the Aesthetica Blog, if you want to explore more of the best in contemporary arts and culture you should read us in print too.

It?s also helped to warm-up a few potboilers. What does this offering on the subject give us ? solid food or warmed over scraps from other people?s tables?\n\n\n?Do men and women speak different languages?? is the rhetorical question posed by Deborah Cameron, who is Rupert Murdoch Professor of Language and Communication at Oxford. A thriving industry has grown up over the past few years of self-help books ? such as Deborah Tannen?s You Just Don?t Understand: Men and Women in Conversation (1990) and John Gray?s Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus (1992) - based on the assertion that there are fundamental differences in the way men and women use language to communicate. It?s on these, and similar works and their underlying attitudes that Cameron turns her sceptical attention. Why does she do this? More of that in a moment. \n\n\nCameron sets-to with a gusto to dispose of several myths about supposed linguistic differences between the sexes. Women talk more than men? No they don?t; women have been found to use more minimal responses in conversation than men. Women?s talk is co-operative whilst men?s is competitive? Not true: among the Malagasy people of Madagascar, confrontational speaking is frowned upon. A more diplomatic form ? kabary ? is favoured, and men are considered to employ it more skilfully than women. And girls are more than capable of being confrontational, as is amply demonstrated by an American example of soccer-playing girls arguing to prevent a group of boys taking over their pitch.\n\n\nMen and women systematically misunderstand one another? Wrong again! Conflicts over misunderstandings usually reflect what expectations men and women want from ? or have about ? each other. Cameron gives the example of British reality TV programme Ladette to Lady, where working-class girls were coached to sound and act like upper-class women? to show that there is no generic way women speak.\n\n\nAh, but what about the view linguistic differences were hard-wired into the sexes to fit them for their roles as hunters (men) and childcare/gatherers (women)? Cameron reminds us that ?the only evidence for the prehistoric sex difference is the modern sex difference that it is supposed to explain?. She makes the point that educated people of both sexes in Western society have more similarities than differences, whilst the much commented-upon feminisation of society has also been accompanied by masculinisation too: middle-class women?s attitudes have become more masculine with their concerns about individual achievement and freedom.\n\n\nBut why, in the face of such evidence, are the Mars/Venus myths so popular? According to Cameron, it?s educated people who adhere to them most, and this is because it?s among them that the greatest amount of change in socio-sexual roles has taken place over recent years, thus giving rise to unwanted uncertainties and the desire for some social stability. Such people want a verbal equivalent of the way children?s clothes are colour coded blue for boys and pink for girls. \n\n\nBut Cameron?s view raises two points. Surely it is among educated people that one would expect to find, if not more acceptance of change, at least an ability to cope with it competently without taking refuge in commonplace myths. Also ? and Cameron doesn?t mention this ? an arguably significant part of the groundwork which enabled the myth of Mars and Venus to flourish was carried out by another group of people some 25 years ago: the women peace campaigners who sprang-up as Anglo-American nuclear re-armament was stopped in the early 1980s. They picketed military bases such as Greenham common ? where the nuclear weapons where deployed ? and happily asserted that women were by nature peace loving whilst men were naturally aggressive. This rehash of Mussolini?s assertion that war was natural for the male child as childbirth was for the female was ? presumably because it was dressed in dungarees rather than black shirts ? allowed to pass without comment at the time, even though it flatly contradicted the equal opportunities feminism of the previous decade which attempted to minimise the difference between the sexes. It may have been a genuine statement of belief, but its use was a recurring ploy ? like Stalin?s re-opening of the churches in Russia as a moral-boosting exercise during the Second World War ? it possibly recognised, and touched on, an almost primeval desire for sexual difference. The recent success of The Dangerous Book for Boys should be heeded here.\n\n\nEarly on, Cameron states the purpose of her book: ?to separate facts from myths, evidence from anecdote, and the reasonable conclusion from speculative and sweeping generalisations?. The results of such generalisations can indeed be harmful ? she cites the example of men not being hired for call-centre work because it is assumed that they will not be as good as women when it comes to communication (she shows that male call-centre workers are just as good as their female coworkers). Attitudes based on the supposed innate skills ? or lack of them ? have been harmful for women in the past and do not bode well for men in the future where manual work has largely disappeared. \n\n\nBut reading the book raises the suspicion that it has a deeper purpose than scholarly untangling of poor or simplistic scholarship. As Cameron notes ?feminists [thought] sexism, based on biological determinism, had disappeared from the mainstream for good, and are alarmed by its sudden return to fashion?. She also says that people ?don?t usually come to the subject of sex difference as ?blank slates?. They come with an agenda: they are looking to biology to justify certain views about society ? how it is and how it should be?. Cameron, one suspects from the general tenor of this book, aligns herself with those worried feminists. There?s nothing wrong with in that, bu, if that?s the case it might, arguably have been better to have declared her concerns at the outset so that they could be borne in mind when evaluating what she had to say. It would certainly explain why she sometimes appears briskly (over-)enthusiastic about dismissing any perceived sexual differences.\n\n\nAs Cameron rightly says ?we need to reject trite formulas and sweeping claims about male and female language-use?. And she continues, ?We must look beyond the myth of Mars and Venus?. Which leaves us to ponder how this might be done. At the risk of exacerbating the sort of tiredness Cameron deplores, we have to face the fact that many people want, or need, some role model for their sex ? and simultaneously, such people recognise that not everyone is comfortable with prescribed role-models, ?natural? or ?social?, and must be given the opportunity to express their own potential even if it doesn?t accord with society?s norms. Roles that are comfortable for some are a straightjacket for others. Perhaps, rather than worrying about linguistic myths and their implications, we need to get beyond the nature?nurture see-saw and concentrate on the difficult but necessary business of developing good character in human beings ? of both sexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?

Where relevant, it also refers to the development stages of that material, \nenabling readers to look back at developmental documents if they wish.\nGLOSSARY\nHandbook Administration (No 23) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/48)\n2.2 The Board has made minor administrative changes to various modules of the \nHandbook, as listed below. These correct or clarify existing provisions. They were \nnot consulted on because they are regarded either as falling within the scope of \nprevious consultations or as being so minor that they do not warrant consultation. \nNone of these changes represents any alteration in FSA policy.\nChange to Glossary: Changes to definition of ?Lloyd?s complaint procedures?\nChanges: Change to FINMAR 2.2.1R\nChange to ICOBS 2.4.1G\nChanges to SUP 16.1.2G and 16.1.3R \nChanges to COLL 7.7.15G\nChanges to PR 1.2.1UK\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   7Handbook Notice 113\nFinancial Stability and Markets sourcebook (FINMAR)\n2.3 When we made the new short-selling rules in FINMAR 2 and deleted the short \nselling provisions from the Market Conduct sourcebook (MAR), it was not our \nintention to change the substance of the requirements in relation to short selling \nother than in one small respect, namely a slight reduction in the scope of the \napplication of the disclosure obligation regarding net short positions held in rights \nissue shares. It has been brought to our attention that the rule in FINMAR 2.2.1R \nrelating to disclosure during a rights issue period has had the effect of making an \nadditional change to our short-selling requirement and is, in addition, inconsistent \nwith the Glossary definition of ?disclosure?. This represented an unintentional \nchange from the pre-existing position and has therefore been corrected.\nInsurance: Conduct of Business sourcebook (ICOBS)\n2.4 The original record-keeping requirements in the Senior Management \nArrangements, Systems and Control sourcebook (SYSC) were implemented on \n1�December�2001\tin\tSYSC\t3.2.20R\tand\tthese\tcontinue\tto\tapply\tto\tinsurers.\tSYSC\t\nwas amended on the 1 November 2007 by the Record Keeping, Interprofessional \nBusiness and Simplified Prospectuses Instrument 2007 (FSA 2007/34). That \ninstrument introduced new rules and guidance on record keeping within \nSYSC�9.1.1R\tto\tSYSC\t9.1.7G\tfor\tfirms,\tincluding\tinsurance\tintermediaries.\t\nHowever, ICOBS 2.4.1G(1) was not amended to reflect the different requirements \nfor those firms. \n2.5 Firms should have been aware of the requirements of SYSC 3 and 9, where \nrelevant,\tas\tthese\thave\tapplied\tsince\tthey\twere\timplemented\ton\t1�December�2001\t\nand\t1�November�2007,\trespectively.\tBut,\tin\torder\tto\tcorrect\tthe\tomission\twe\thave\t\nrevised ICOBS 2.4.1G(1) so that it correctly reflects the reference to record \nkeeping for all firms. \nOther changes\n2.6 In summary the other amendments made this month are as follows:\n?\t corrections to cross-references (in the Glossary, SUP 16.1.2G and  \nCOLL 7.7);\n?\t deletion of out-of-date material in SUP 16.1.3R; and\n?\t a change to the Prospectus Rules (PR 1.2.1UK), which sets out the \ntext of section 86 of the Act (Exempt offers to the public), to reflect an \namendment which has been made to that section.\n2.7 These changes come into force on 1 October 2011.\n8   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\nTraining and Competence Sourcebook (Accredited Bodies and \nQualifications Amendments No 2) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/50)\n2.8 For changes made to the Glossary by this instrument, see paragraphs 2.15 to 2.17 \nof this Notice.\nLiquidity Standards (Miscellaneous Amendments No 3) Instrument \n2011 (FSA 2011/52)\n2.9 For changes made to the Glossary by this instrument, see paragraphs 2.23 to 2.25 \nof this Notice.\nHIGH LEVEL STANDARDS\nSenior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC)\nSenior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls \n(Amendment No 3) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/49)\n1\n2.10 Following consultation in CP11/11 , the Board has made the following changes to \nthe Handbook:\nChange: Addition of SYSC 6.1.7R\n2.11 The rule added to SYSC by this change clarifies the rules for common platform \nfirms that conduct investment services and activities from a branch in another \nMember State. The rule makes it clear that such branches are subject to the Host \nState?s requirements for those investment services and activities for the purposes of \narticle 13(2) of MiFID and the MiFID implementing Directive.\n2.12 This instrument comes into force from 1 October 2011 and feedback on this \nconsultation is provided in Chapter 4, below.\nFinancial Stability and Market Confidence sourcebook (FINMAR)\nHandbook Administration (No 23) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/48)\n2.13 For changes made to FINMAR by this instrument, see paragraphs 2.2 to 2.7 of \nthis Notice.\n1 CP11/11  Quarterly consultation (No 29) (June 2011).\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   9Handbook Notice 113\nTraining and Competence sourcebook (TC)\nTraining and Competence Sourcebook (Accredited Bodies and \nQualifications Amendments No 2) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/50)\n2\n2.14 Following consultation in Chapter 3 of CP11/11 , the Board has made the \nfollowing changes to the Handbook: \nChange to Glossary: Change to ?accredited body?\nChanges: Change to TC 2.1.7R\nChanges to TC Appendix 1.1, Appendix 4E\n2.15 The Training and Competence sourcebook (TC) contains a list of appropriate \nqualifications.

These amendments will remove the risk of \ninformation asymmetry between the FSA and firms to ensure that UK groups are \nholding adequate capital.\n2.19 These rule changes have been made to discontinue the use of non-EEA rules in \ncalculating group capital requirements and prevent the FSA being subjected to \ninfraction proceedings by the European Commission for non-compliance with the \nCapital Requirements Directive. \n2.20 This instrument comes into force on 31 December 2011 and feedback on this \nconsultation will be provided in a separate policy statement published by the FSA.\nLiquidity Standards (Miscellaneous Amendments No 3) Instrument \n2011 (FSA 2011/52)\n4\n2.21 Following consultation in Chapter 4 of CP11/11 , the Board has approved the \nfollowing changes to the Handbook:\nChanges to Glossary: Changes to ?DLG by default? and ?low frequency liquidity \nreporting firm?\nChanges: Changes to BIPRU 12.6.15R and 12.6.17G\nChanges to BIPRU TP 30\nChanges to SUP 16.12.5R, 16.12.11R, 16.12.15R and \n16.12.22A\n2.22 In summary, these changes:\n?\t amend the reporting requirements for the completion of FSA052 and \nassociated guidance;\n?\t refine the Glossary definition of ?DLG by default? to clarify that where \nonly ILAS (individual liquidity adequacy standards) BIPRU firms are \nwithin a reporting group, the DLG by default reporting requirements do \nnot apply;\n?\t correct and amend the simplified ILAS approach;\n?\t extend the transitional arrangements for mismatch firms until \n31�December�2012\tto\tenable\tthe\tFSA\tto\tissue\tthese\tfirms\twith\t \nindividual liquidity guidance; and \n4 CP11/11  Quarterly consultation (No 29) (June 2011).\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   11Handbook Notice 113\n?\t amend the Glossary definition of ?low frequency liquidity reporting firm? \nto include firms with balance sheet assets of less than �5bn.\n2.23 This instrument comes into force on 1 November 2011.

We have subsequently been alerted to issues with the technical \napplication of these rules and, therefore, proposed in CP11/15 to amend the \nexisting rules, taking into account these issues.\n2.31 In the meantime, the changes in this instrument have been made to extend the current \ntransitional provisions for the rules prohibiting general liens in custody agreements \nfor six months from 1 October 2011 to March 2012 and to provide interim relief \nfrom the prohibition on general liens for all agreements currently subject to these \nrules\tfor\tthe\tsame\tperiod\tand\tto\tre-introduce\tguidance\tin\tCASS�6.3.3G(4)\trequiring\t\nfirms to consider any liens when entering into custody agreements.\n2.32 The substantive changes to the rules on custody liens will be addressed in a \nseparate policy statement after the consultation for those changes closes on \n28�October�2011.\t(Changes\tto\tthe\tCASS\trules\tto\tprovide\tfor\tthe\ttaking\tof\tcertain\t\nliens or rights over omnibus client accounts and changes in the rules in relation to \nliens or rights over assets held in overseas jurisdictions.)\n6 CP11/15  Client assets sourcebook:(1) custody liens (2) title transfer collateral arrangements (July 2011).\n7 PS10/16  Client Assets Sourcebook (Enhancements) Instrument 2011: Feedback on CP10/9 and made rules (October 2010).\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   13Handbook Notice 113\nTitle transfer collateral arrangements (TTCA)\n2.33 The changes made by the Board in this instrument in respect of TTCAs extend the \nrestriction on the application of TTCA and associated provisions to include rolling \nspot forex contracts that are offered to retail clients in the form of both futures \nand CFDs.

These amendments cover:\n?\t SUP 16.12.5R;\n?\t SUP 16 Annex 24R (Reporting forms); and\n?\t SUP 16 Annex 25G (Guidance on completing the forms).\n4.3 The consultation covered some clarification to reporting rules, and changes to \nguidance, validations and data items. These changes are relevant to:\n?\t firms subject to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD); and\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   19Handbook Notice 113\n?\t exempt Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) firms subject to chapters 9 \nand 13 of IPRU(INV) or IPRU(INV)9 and IPR(INV)13.\n4.4 We received no responses to the proposals so the amendments have been made \nexactly as proposed. The changes are listed and described in paragraphs 2.48 to \n2.51 of this Notice.\nChapter 2 of CP11/11, Quarterly consultation (No 29)\nSenior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls \n(Amendment No 3) Instrument 2011 (FSA 2011/49)\nSenior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls  \nsourcebook (SYSC)\n4.5 In Chapter 2 of CP11/11 we consulted on a new rule to Chapter 6.1 (Compliance, \ninternal audit and financial crime) of SYSC which would apply to a common \n11\nplatform firm conducting investment services and activities from a branch in \nanother EEA State. \n4.6 We explained that when we consulted on our proposals to implement the Markets \n12\nin Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in PS06/13 , subsequently confirmed \n13\nin PS07/23 , it was our clear policy intention that the common platform \nrequirements in Chapters 4 to 10 of SYSC should apply to a common platform \nfirm in relation to passported activities carried on from a branch in another \nMember State. While it was clear that the high level over-arching rule SYSC 4.1.1R \nand the common platform generally applied in this way to EEA branches of UK \ncommon platform firms conducting investment services and activities, the reference \nto the ?regulatory system? in SYSC 6.1.1R appeared to cut back the application of \nthe compliance requirements so they only applied in relation to compliance with \nUK rules and did not extend to compliance with host state requirements. \n4.7 The new rule would eliminate this potential uncertainty making it clear that such \nbranches are subject to the host state?s requirements for those investment services \nand activities for the purposes of article 13(2) of MiFID.\n11 A common platform firm is a firm that is a BIPRU firm (ie a firm covered by the Prudential sourcebook for Banks, \nBuilding Societies and Investment Firms (BIPRU) ? a building society, bank, full scope BIPRU investment firm, BIPRU \nlimited licence firm or BIPRU limited activity firm), an exempt Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) firm, a UK MiFID \ninvestment firm which falls within the definition of ?local firm? in Article 3.1P of the CAD or a dormant account fund \noperator (see the Glossary to the FSA Handbook). http://fsahandbook.info/FSA/html/handbook/Glossary/C)\n12 PS06/13  Organisational systems and controls ?

We asked:\nQ1: Do you agree with our proposed new rule to make \nit clear that EEA branches of UK common platform \nfirms are subject both to UK and to their host state?s \nrequirements for any investment services or activities \nthey conduct?\n4.9 Both respondents agreed with our proposal. \n4.10 The changes made by this instrument are listed and described in paragraphs 2.11 \nto 2.13 of this Notice.\nChapter 3 of CP11/11, Quarterly consultation (No 29)\nTraining and Competence Sourcebook (Accredited Bodies and \nQualifications Amendments No 2) 2011 (FSA 2011/50)\nGlossary of definitions \nTraining and Competence sourcebook (TC)\n14 15\n4.11 In Chapter 2 of PS11/1 and Chapter 3 of PS10/18 we confirmed there would \nbe an enhanced role under our Retail Distribution Review (RDR) for bodies we \naccredit, where they meet our criteria, and that we would publish an appropriate \nqualifications list in our Training and Competence sourcebook (TC). We also said \nthat we would consult for one month each time we proposed that a new \nqualification should be added or removed from the appropriate qualification list.\n4.12 We consulted in Chapter 3 of CP11/11 on the following proposals:\n?\t extending the list of appropriate qualifications for a number of activities; \n?\t continuing to list regulatory modules separately within our appropriate \nqualifications list in order to provide a degree of certainty that the \nmodule correctly forms a part of the stated qualification; and\n?\t adding the names of bodies who have applied for accredited status \nwhere we have assessed them as meeting our criteria.\n4.13 In addition to the above we also proposed making a change to the following \nactivities in TC Appendix 1 to exclude ?personal pension schemes?:\n14 PS11/1  Distribution of retail investments: Delivering the RDR ? professionalism (January 2011).\n15 PS10/18  Feedback to CP10/12 Competence and ethics and final rules (December 2010).\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   21Handbook Notice 113\n?\t advising in securities that are not stakeholder pension schemes or broker \nfunds; and\n?\t advising on and dealing in securities that are not stakeholder pension \nschemes or broker funds.\nAppropriate qualifications \n4.14 We first published a list of appropriate transitional qualifications in \nDecember�2009\tfollowing\tthe\traise\tof\tprofessional\tstandards\tfrom\tQCF\tlevel\t3\t \nto\tQCF\tlevel\t4.\tThe\tFinancial\tServices\tSkills\tCouncil\t(FSSC)\tthen\tdeveloped,\t\nconsulted on and published the modernised exam standards which allowed new \nRDR-compliant qualifications to be developed. We continue to receive new \nqualifications to be included in the appropriate qualifications list.\n4.15 We proposed adding certain legacy qualifications from the previous list maintained \nby the Financial Services Skills Council to TC. This sourcebook contains \nqualification requirements for individuals carrying out certain retail activities. \n4.16 For the TC activity of advising on (but not dealing in) securities (which are  \nnot stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes or broker funds)  \nwe proposed:\n?\t adding the Chartered Insurance Institute?s Financial Planning Certificate \n(to be removed from list on 31 December 2012); \n?\t adding the Chartered Insurance Institute?s G70 paper of the Advanced \nFinancial Planning Certificate, with a key of ?C? (to be removed from \nlist on 31 December 2012); and \n?\t amending the entry for the Chartered Insurance Institute?s Advanced \nFinancial Planning Certificate to remove reference to the G70 paper.\n4.17 All eleven responses agreed with our proposals. We will go ahead and amend the \nappropriate qualifications list as proposed.\n4.18 We also consulted on the need to separately list regulatory modules on the \nappropriate qualifications list, and if we are going to remove all regulatory modules, \nif we should do so now, or as we review the underlying examination standards.\n4.19 We received eleven responses, of which ten agreed that the regulatory modules do \nnot need to be listed on the appropriate qualifications list separately. However, one \nrespondent felt that not listing the regulatory modules separately could be difficult \nfor qualification providers if firms needed to contact them to check details. They \nalso felt that listing the modules separately provides a degree of certainty that the \nmodule correctly forms a part of the stated qualification. We felt these were both \nvalid points, and so we will not be making any changes to the Handbook \n22   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\nimmediately; instead we will review how we list regulatory modules on a case by \n16\ncase basis, when we review the associated exam standards for each TC activity.\nAccredited Bodies\n4.20 In CP11/11 we consulted on the addition of six Accredited Bodies to the Glossary \nof Definitions that meet our requirements. Those accredited bodies are:\n?\t CFA Society of the UK;\n?\t The Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment;\n?\t The Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland;\n?\t The Chartered Insurance Institute;\n?\t The Institute of Financial Planning; and\n?\t The Institute of Financial Services.\n4.21 None of the respondents objected. In response to feedback The Institute of Financial \nServices has been changed to The ifs School of Finance. The Board agreed with the \nrecommendation to designate these bodies as accredited bodies.\nRemoving ?personal pension schemes? from two TC activities \n4.22 Finally we consulted on changing the following activities in TC Appendix 1 to \nexclude ?personal pension schemes?:\n?\t advising on securities that are not stakeholder pension schemes or \nbroker funds; and\n?\t advising on and dealing in securities that are not stakeholder pension \nschemes or broker funds.\n4.23 The reason for this proposal is that although the term ?personal pension schemes? \nis listed in our Glossary in the definition of a ?security?, it also appears in our \nGlossary in the definition of a ?packaged product?. It is right that personal pension \nscheme continues to be included as a term within the definition of a security, but, \nfor the purpose of being competent to advise on a personal pension scheme, it is \nthe reference in the definition of packaged products that is relevant.\n4.24 The four respondents who commented on this proposal agreed that personal \npensions should be removed from the examination standards for securities. \nHowever, the respondents felt that it must be made clear that if individuals are \nadvising on personal pensions schemes, they need to attain an appropriate \n16 Exam standards set out the learning outcomes and indicative content we expect appropriate qualifications to cover as  \na minimum.\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   23Handbook Notice 113\nqualification listed under the TC activity of advising on packaged products \n(changing to retail investment products post end 2012).\n4.25 The further changes mentioned above do not affect the cost benefit analysis or the \ncompatibility statement which remain as published in the CP. This instrument is \nreferred to further at paragraphs 2.15 to 2.17 of this Notice.\nChapter 4 of CP11/11, Quarterly Consultation (No 29)\nLiquidity Standards (Miscellaneous Amendments No 3) Instrument \n2011(FSA 2011/52)\nGlossary of definitions \nPrudential sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and Investment \nFirms (BIPRU) \nSupervision manual (SUP)\n4.26 In CP11/11 we consulted on rule amendments to Chapter 12 of the Prudential \nsourcebook for Banks, Building Societies, and Investment Firms (BIPRU), \nChapter�16.12\tof\tthe\tSupervision\tmanual\t(SUP)\tand\tcertain\tglossary\tdefinitions.\n4.27 The proposals comprised: \n?\t an amendment to the reporting requirements for the completion of \nFSA052 (SUP 16.12) and associated guidance (SUP 16 Annex 25G);\n?\t an amendment to the Glossary definition of ?DLG by default?;\n?\t corrections and amendments to the simplified individual liquidity \nadequacy\tstandards\t(ILAS)\tapproach\t(BIPRU�12.6);\n?\t an extension to the transitional arrangements for mismatch firms \nthat managed liquidity risk using Chapter LM IPRU(BANK) as at \n30�November�2009\t(BIPRU\tTP\t30);\tand\n?\t an amendment to the Glossary definition of ?low frequency liquidity \nreporting firm?.\n4.28 The amendments to the SUP 16.12 rules in relation to the completion of FSA052 \nand the associated guidance make it clear the data item should be completed in \nthree respective currencies (sterling (GBP), US dollar (USD) and euro (EUR)). This \namendment should correct current inconsistency in reporting practices.\n4.29 The amendment to the definition of ?DLG by default? means that where there are \nonly ILAS BIPRU firms within the reporting group the DLG by default reporting \nrequirements do not apply.\n24   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\n4.30 The corrections and amendments to the simplified ILAS approach means the \nformula captures the non-defined/open maturity columns from FSA048 and that \nthe wholesale credit pipeline risk is captured.\n4.31 The changes to SUP TP 30 extend the transitional requirements for former \nmismatch firms until 31 December 2012. This allows us time to issue all of these \nfirms with individual liquidity guidance (ILG).\n4.32 The amendment to the definition of ?low frequency liquidity reporting firm? will \nmean that firms with balance sheet assets of less than �5bn will be low frequency \nliquidity reporting firms and will submit the liquidity data items on a monthly \nrather than weekly basis.\nResponses\n4.33 We received four responses to the consultation, all of which broadly supported  \nthe proposals.\nCost benefit analysis and compatibility statement \n4.34 In CP11/11, we set out the outcomes of our cost benefit analysis (CBA) and our \nconsideration of the proposals in the context of our statutory objectives and \nprinciples of good regulation. The CBA and compatibility statement for the \nproposal remain unchanged from those published in CP11/11.\n4.35 The changes made by this instrument are listed and described at paragraphs 2.22 \nto 2.24 of this Notice.\nChapter 5 of CP11/11, Quarterly consultation (No 29) \nFinancial Promotions Guidance (Amendment) Instrument 2011  \n(FSA 2011/53)\nConduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) and Banking: Conduct of \nBusiness Sourcebook (BCOBS)\n4.36 In CP11/11 we consulted on introducing guidance in COBS 4 and BCOBS 2 to \nmake it clearer for firms who market products, including structured products, to \nunderstand how the ?fair, clear and not misleading? rule applies in respect of \nproducts or services which are described as ?guaranteed?, ?protected? or ?secure?.\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   25Handbook Notice 113\n4.37 We asked:\nQ1: Do you agree that the proposed guidance on use  \nof the terms ?guaranteed?, ?protected? or ?secure?  \nis appropriate? \n4.38 Most respondents supported the proposal, so we have not altered the amendments \nproposed. Some respondents took the view that this guidance did not go far enough \nand suggested that the FSA provide more detailed guidance or consult on a rule. \nOur response\nWe have not proposed a rule as introducing a rule would be  \nsuper-equivalent to the relevant conduct of business requirements \nof the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (in so far \nas the instrument covers subject matter that is within the scope of \nharmonisation by the MiFID).\n4.39 The changes made by this instrument are listed and described in paragraphs 2.30 \nto 2.32 of this Notice.\nChapter 7 of CP11/11, Quarterly consultation (No 29)\nCompensation Sourcebook (Occupational Pension Scheme Trustees) \nInstrument 2011 (FSA 2011/61)\nCompensation sourcebook (COMP)\n4.40 In CP11/11 we consulted on an amendment to enable corporate trustees of \noccupational pension schemes to make claims to the Financial Services \nCompensation Scheme (FSCS) in relation to a life insurance policy of an insurer in \nthe same group, where the sponsoring employer is a ?large? employer. We also \nconsulted on an amendment to clarify our rules to confirm that, if a firm that is \nnot a life insurer fails, group-affiliated corporate trustees of occupational pension \nschemes where the sponsoring employer is ?large? are not eligible to make claims to \nthe FSCS.\n4.41 Extending the categories of persons who can make claims to the FSCS means that, \nshould a life insurer fail, firms could face higher costs due to increased FSCS levies. \nWe estimated that the value of the additional benefits protected by the FSCS, \n26   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\nexpressed as a percentage of the insurer?s total liabilities to life insurance \npolicyholders, could range from 0.1% to as much as 10%. This range was an \nover-estimate and reflected the different values of policies held by trustees. In the \npast there have been few instances of life insurers failing. \nResponses to individual questions\n4.42 We asked:\nQ1: Do you agree that a corporate trustee of an \noccupational pension scheme should be eligible to \nmake claims to the FSCS in relation to a life insurance \npolicy where the trustee is in the same group as the \nlife insurer that issued the policy and the sponsoring \nemployer is a large employer (as is the current position \nfor non-group affiliated trustees)?\n4.43 We received seven responses, six supported the change and one had no comment \non the proposals. One of the respondents supported the change in principle, but \nwas concerned that the uncertainty about the potential cost made it difficult to \nassess the potential size of any compensation levy. Another asked if the FSA had \nconsidered in its cost benefit analysis (CBA) how the change would impact on the \ncost of levies for life insurers who issued policies to trustees who would be \nbrought into FSCS protection. \nOur response\nIn carrying out the CBA we found that life insurers do not routinely \nrecord the size of the sponsoring employer of occupational pension \nschemes. For this reason, and because of the wide variation in the \nnumber of members in a scheme and the value of their policies, we \nconsulted on a range of figures to illustrate the possible impact. \nShould a life insurer fail, the amount of compensation costs the FSCS \ncan levy the life and pensions provision sub-class in any year is limited \nto �690m. But the actual FSCS compensation costs will vary, depending \non the value of the protected business written by that insurer for \neligible claimants. Therefore, it is not possible to assess in advance of a \nparticular failure the potential size of any compensation levy. However, \nlife insurance claims will become payable over a period of years so any \nlevies required to meet compensation costs could also be phased. \nThe impact of a compensation levy on individual insurers will depend \nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   27Handbook Notice 113\non the level of business written. The tariff base for 75% of the levy is \ncalculated by reference to relevant net premium income, ie. premiums \nrelating to protected contracts of insurance. The proposed change has no \nimpact on this part of the levy as protected contracts of insurance include \ncontracts with claimants who are not eligible to make claims to FSCS.\nHowever, the tariff base for 25% of the levy is based on technical \nprovisions for protected contracts of insurance with eligible claimants. \nThe proposed change will, therefore, mean that insurers where the \ncorporate trustee of the occupational pension scheme is in the same \ngroup as the life insurer and the sponsoring employer is large may need \nto contribute a proportionately higher amount. However, this reflects the \nincrease in protection. \n4.44 In the light of the responses we have received, we are making the changes as \nconsulted on. The instrument does not differ significantly from the consultative \ndraft. The rules making the changes will take effect from 1 October 2011. \nCost benefit analysis and compatibility statement\n4.45 The cost benefit issues raised by respondents have been considered and do not \nmaterially influence the outcome of the CBA. The CBA and compatibility \nstatement presented in CP11/11 still hold. The full list of changes made by this \ninstrument is set out at paragraphs 2.53 to 2.55 of this Notice. \nChapter 9 of CP11/11, Quarterly consultation (No 29)\nSupervision Manual (Amendment No 18) Instrument 2011 \n(FSA 2011/57)\nSupervision manual (SUP)\n4.46 In Chapter 9 of CP11/11, we consulted on proposals to simplify the way firms \nsubmit written reports under Chapter 16 of SUP to the FSA. \n4.47 We proposed:\n?\t to remove the rule stating that a written report must be ?given to or \naddressed for the attention of the firm?s usual supervisory contact?;\n?\t to require all such written reports to be delivered to the central reporting \nteam; and\n?\t to remove the reference in the rule to the Early Reporting System.\n28   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\n4.48 We received four responses; three of which were supportive of our proposals. \n4.49 One respondent suggested that all reports should be submitted through the FSA?s \nelectronic reporting system, Gathering Better Regulatory Information \nElectronically (GABRIEL), as the process differs for each type of report. \n4.50 One respondent asked for clarification on whether our proposals apply to just \nroutine written reports, such as annual close links and controllers reports, or also \nto ad hoc written reports. \n4.51 One respondent asked how they will be alerted to the implementation of the new \nreporting provisions.\n4.52 One respondent was concerned that our proposals would lead to \nmisunderstandings and mistakes from both the firms and FSA alike. It was felt \nthat the proposals were inappropriate for PRA-scope firms as it ran counter to the \nPRA approach document of May 2011, paragraph 73 which states ?Firms will be \nexpected to have wide data sets, beyond what is regularly submitted, available for \nPRA supervisors to call upon at short notice, if judged necessary for the \nassessment of risk or as a ?spot check??. There was concern that a supervisor may \nrequest a written report to be sent to them directly, which may confuse the firm.\n4.53 The respondent was also concerned that the central reporting team would misfile \nreports, or delay them in some way, and therefore erroneously starting the process \nof charging the firm a fee, and hold up the supervisory process. The respondent \nconsiders the supervisor to be the best person to enforce the reporting deadline.\nOur response \nWhilst our proposals focus on making changes to SUP 16.3.9R to \nSUP�16.3.10G; our proposal should be taken into context with an earlier \nrule (SUP 16.3.6R) which states ?a periodic report required to be submitted \nunder this chapter, or under any other rule, must be submitted in writing \nin accordance with SUP 16.3.7R to SUP 16.3.10G?. Therefore, our intention \nwhen referring to ?written reports? was in context with the earlier mention \nof ?periodic reports? required to be submitted under this chapter, which we \nhope clarifies the misunderstandings raised by two respondents. \nMany of these periodic reports do not have a prescribed format, \nand therefore these would be difficult to collect via our electronic \nreporting system, GABRIEL, due to the free-format nature of the \ninformation provided.\nWe are currently in the process of introducing the scheduling of certain \nperiodic reports to GABRIEL. Therefore, we intend to collect these reports \ncentrally to enable us to record receipt of them on GABRIEL. This will \nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   29Handbook Notice 113\nbenefit firms so that they can see when they are due, when they have \nbeen received by the FSA and also utilise the functionality available \nin GABRIEL by sending firms automated reminder emails. Upon receipt \nof the periodic report by the central reporting team, the report will \nbe logged and passed to the relevant supervisor using existing agreed \nprocesses and timescales. \nThe central reporting team has been established for a number of years \nand already receives a high volume of reports from both small and large \nfirms. Our proposals are intended to focus on firms who currently send \nthis information to their usual supervisory contact to allow for centralised \ncollection and consistent processing of the regulatory data received.\nCollecting and controlling the receipt of regulatory data centrally also \nallows our supervisory colleagues to focus on the analysis of data and \neffective supervision of firms, whist the central reporting team can \ncost-effectively monitor the high volumes of regulatory data received \nby the FSA.\nCost benefit analysis and compatibility statement \n4.54 In CP11/11, we set out the outcomes of our cost benefit analysis (CBA) and our \nconsideration of the proposals in the context of our statutory objectives and \nprinciples of good regulation. The CBA and compatibility statement for the \nproposal remain unchanged from those published in CP11/11.\n4.55 The changes made by this instrument are listed and described in paragraphs 2.45 \nto 2.47 of this Notice.\nCP11/15 Client assets sourcebook: (1) Custody liens and  \n(2) title transfer collateral arrangements\nClient Assets Sourcebook (Collateral Transfer and Liens Amendment) \nInstrument 2011 (FSA 2011/56)\nClient assets sourcebook (CASS)\n4.56 We published CP11/15 containing proposals to make changes to the CASS \nsourcebook regarding custody liens and title transfer collateral arrangements (TTCA).\n4.57 In this Handbook Notice, we address those proposals contained in CP11/15 with \na one-month consultation period:\n?\t custody liens: providing interim relief in respect of the prohibition \non general liens over custody assets for six months to expire on \n30   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\n31�March�2012\tand\tre-introducing\tguidance\trequiring\tfirms\tto\tconsider\t\nany liens when entering into custody agreements; and\n?\t title transfer collateral arrangements: extending the prohibition on \nusing title transfer collateral arrangements to include rolling spot \nforex contracts offered to retail clients in the form of both futures and \ncontracts for differences (CFDs).\n4.58 Further changes relating to custody liens consulted on in CP11/15 (changes to  \nthe CASS rules to provide for the taking of certain liens or rights over omnibus \nclient accounts and changes in the rules in relation to liens or rights over assets \nheld in overseas jurisdictions) have a longer consultation period closing on \n28�October�2011,\tand\tare\tnot\taddressed\tby\tthis\tHandbook\tNotice,\tthey\twill\tbe\t\naddressed in a separate policy statement.\n4.59 The policy objectives behind the introduction of these changes are as follows:\n?\t custody liens ? to allow time for appropriate consultation on substantive \nchanges to our rules on custody liens (interim relief) and to put in place \nan interim measure to reinforce the intention of protecting client assets \n(re-introduction of guidance); and\n?\t title transfer collateral arrangements ? to strengthen protection for retail \nclients entering into certain types of CFD business, and to reduce risks \nto our statutory objective of consumer protection.\n4.60 We received eight responses to the consultation, of which one was from a law firm \nrepresenting eight firms. All responses addressed our proposals on custody liens. \nOne also addressed our proposals in respect of TTCA. One respondent commented \nthat their firm did not wish to conduct TTCA business with retail clients but did \nnot address the TTCA policy proposals.\n4.61 We set out our response to the consultation responses received in respect of our \nproposals on custody liens (interim relief and re-introduction of guidance) and \nTTCA (rolling spot forex contracts).\n4.62 We asked:\nQ1: Do you agree with our proposal to switch off \nCASS�6.3.5R for all agreements subject to this rule \nfor six months from 1 October 2011 expiring on \n31�March�2012?\n4.63 The responses to this proposal were broadly supportive. Respondents were in \noverall agreement with the proposals. Some respondents said that firms would \nneed a longer period to repaper existing agreements once the new rules are made \nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   31Handbook Notice 113\nfollowing the second part of the consultation. A law firm writing on behalf of \neight authorised firms raised issues regarding the provision of interim relief from \nthe current rule. The firms in question believe that further clarification is necessary \nin relation to the provisions for interim relief and proposed that the FSA undertake \ntwo actions. They proposed that: \n?\t prior to providing interim relief from the rules (i.e. prior to making the \ninstrument which is the subject of this Handbook Notice), the FSA issue \na statement that we do not intend to take action against firms in breach \nof this rule if it would be in compliance with the proposed new rules; and \n?\t we designate CASS 6.3.5R as a rule to which section 150(1) of the \nFinancial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) does not apply. Section 150 \nof FSMA sets out the right of a private person who suffers loss as the \nresult of a contravention of FSA rules to bring an action for damages.\n4.64 Otherwise, the firms represented were in agreement with the principle of  \nthe proposals.\n4.65 Another respondent questioned the way in which we intend to provide interim \nrelief, asking for clarification whether the policy intention of this change means \nthere is no restriction or prohibition on liens during the time we provide interim \nrelief from CASS 6.3.5R. \n4.66 One respondent, while expressing overall support for the policy objectives of our \nproposals in CP11/15, also expressed some concerns. The respondent felt it \nimportant to bolster protection available to clients under our rules in the light of \nus providing interim relief while we re-consult. They felt that further measures \nshould be considered beyond the reinstatement of the guidance provision in order \nto mitigate the risks. This respondent also felt that firms should inform clients of \nthe impact of any general liens on their assets. \nOur response\nWe will take into account concerns about time needed for firms to \nrepaper agreements when issuing the policy statement after the second \npart of the consultation in CP11/15 closes (on 28 October), and consider \nat that time appropriate transitional periods for the new rules. This does \nnot impact the changes addressed in this Handbook Notice.\nIn response to concerns about the FSA taking action in respect of \nbreaches of CASS 6.3.5R incurred in the period between 1 March 2011 \nand 1 October 2011 and the policy intention behind these changes, \nwe understand that firms who have entered into new agreements may \nhave granted liens over omnibus accounts. For the reasons set out in \n32   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\nCP11/15 we have acted to provide interim relief from the prohibition but \nrecognise that the grant of such liens at that time was a technical breach \nof the rules. \nHowever, we do not expect firms to update these agreements until \nthe new rules are brought into force (the final rules being subject \nto consultation responses to the second part of the consultation in \nCP11/15). However, we would, be concerned if agreements entered into \nduring this period contained wide ranging general liens of a type which \nwould have been inconsistent with the guidance in CASS 6.3.3G(4) which \nhas now been re-introduced as part of the interim relief. \nIn respect of section 150 of FSMA, we do not consider that it would \nbe appropriate to turn-off this section in the way requested. If a firm \nhas entered into an inappropriate lien that has caused a client loss and \ngiven rise to a valid claim under this section then we would not wish \nto jeopardise such a claim. Our policy position regarding inappropriate \ngeneral liens has not changed; such liens should not be granted over safe \ncustody assets. The changes proposed in CP11/15 are technical changes \nto ensure the rules achieve the policy objective.\n4.67 In order to clarify our policy objective of providing interim relief, we are also \nreferencing CASS 6.3.6R in the extended transitional provisions, although we did \nnot mention the rule explicitly in CP11/15. This adjustment is reflected in the \ninstrument, which remains largely the same as the consultative draft.\n4.68 As a response to this feedback regarding the sufficiency of reintroducing guidance \nduring the period of consultation, and the suggestion that firms inform clients of \nthe impact of general liens on their assets, we note that we are constrained by the \nconsultation process from introducing further changes at this time. In the \nmeantime, we refer firms to our guidance that they should consider the terms of \ntheir custody agreements, and note that we remain alert to the possibility of \ninappropriate agreements. \n4.69 We feel we have addressed the issues raised in consultation, and since the \nrespondents were in general agreement with the proposal to provide interim relief, \nwe will therefore proceed to make the changes as consulted. This will allow us to \nconsider more substantial changes as outlined in CP11/15.\n4.70 We asked: \nQ7: Do you agree with our proposal to prohibit the use of \nTTCA with rolling spot forex contracts offered to retail \nclients in the form both of futures and CFDs?\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   33Handbook Notice 113\n4.71 One respondent gave their general support for this proposal and another \ncommented without agreeing or disagreeing with the proposal.\nOur response\n17\nAs we set out in the MiFID implementing PS07/2 , our intention was \nthat TTCA should not be used for retail clients: ?we take this opportunity \nto reiterate our earlier comments that we would be concerned if firms \ntried to use the flexibility in the recitals to avoid providing client money \nprotection to retail clients. This would appear inconsistent with a firm?s \nobligation to act honestly, fairly and professionally?.\nWe still believe the arguments put forward in PS07/2, CP10/15 Chapter�8 \nand CP11/15 remain applicable, and are pleased that there has been no \nopposition to these proposals. Therefore, we will proceed to make the \nchanges as proposed.\nCost benefit analysis\nCustody liens\n4.72 We asked:\nQ8: What are your views on the benefits and costs of our \nproposed policy measures relating to custody liens?\n4.73 One respondent considered that it would have been more appropriate to consider \nthe rules in place before the publication of PS10/16 as a ?starting point? when \nconsidering the costs and benefits.\nTitle transfer collateral\n4.74 We asked:\nQ9: What are your views on the benefits and costs of our \nproposed policy measures relating to title transfer \ncollateral arrangements and rolling spot forex contracts?\n4.75 There were no comments in respect of this question.\n17 PS07/2  Implementing the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) ? Feedback on CP06/14, CP06/19 and \nCP06/20 (January 2007).\n34   Financial Services Authority September 2011Handbook Notice 113\nOur response\nWe will consider as appropriate these and any further comments on the \ncost benefit analysis (CBA) in relation to custody liens received before \npublishing the policy statement that will follow the close of the second \npart of the consultation (28 October 2011).\nAn analysis of the benefits and estimates of the costs of the prohibition \non liens were provided in CP10/09, using as a baseline the rules prior to \nthe changes proposed in CP10/09. At the time we stated that the main \nbenefit of the prohibition on general liens in custodian contracts was \nlikely to be that client assets would no longer be exposed to the risk of a \ncustodian or sub-custodian failing. The main costs included one-off legal \ncosts to firms of amending contracts with their network of custodians, \nalthough not all firms were considered to be affected in practice. \nIn CP11/15 we then consulted on the issues summarised in paragraph \n4.56. In the CBA in CP11/15 we took the baseline to be the rules on \nliens set out in PS10/16. If we took the same baseline for both CP10/09 \nand CP11/15 the relevant costs would have been double counted. To \nthe extent that firms have not already incurred the costs of the rules \nintroduced in PS10/16, they will incur these costs once the transitional \nperiod extended by CP11/15 ends, and subject to consultation responses, \nthe new rules have been implemented. \nTo the extent that we provide interim relief from the rules published in \nPS10/16 to allow for certain liens in relation to omnibus accounts, we \nnoted in our CBA that this is likely to reduce the overall costs to firms \nestimated in CP10/09, except if firms need to re-paper twice as a result \nof the change. Survey evidence collected for the CBA work for CP11/15 \nsuggests the number of firms that have re-papered contracts following \nPS10/15 is likely to be negligible.\n4.76 The cost benefit analysis therefore remains unchanged from that published in \nCP10/15, as does the compatibility statement. The changes now made by this \ninstrument are listed and described in paragraphs 2.35 to 2.41 of this Notice.\nSeptember 2011 Financial Services Authority   35Annex A \n \nList of new instruments and addenda \n \n(See also descriptions within Annex E) \n \nInstruments made or approved by the Board on 22 September 2011 \n \nModules No. of Changes \nTitle of instrument CP \naffected instrument effective \nGlossary, \nHandbook Administration (No 23) Instrument FINMAR, \nN/a FSA 2011/48 1.10.11 \n2011 ICOBS, SUP, \nCOLL, PR \nSenior Management Arrangements, Systems and 11/11 \nSYSC FSA 2011/49 1.10.11 \nControls (Amendment No 3) Instrument 2011 (Ch 2) \nTraining and Competence Sourcebook \n11/11 1.10.11 \n(Accredited Bodies and Qualifications Glossary, TC FSA 2011/50 \n(Ch 3) (part) \nAmendment No 2) Instrument 2011 \nPrudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building \nSocieties and Investment Firms (Group Risk 11/6 BIPRU, SUP FSA 2011/51 31.12.11 \nConsolidation) Instrument 2011  \nLiquidity Standards (Miscellaneous Amendments 11/11 Glossary, \nFSA 2011/52 1.11.11 \nNo 3) Instrument 2011 (Ch 4) BIPRU, SUP \nFinancial Promotions Guidance (Amendment) 11/11 \nCOBS, BCOBS FSA 2011/53 22.3.12 \nInstrument 2011 (Ch 5) \nTo follow   FSA 2011/54  \nTo follow   FSA 2011/55  \nClient Assets Sourcebook (Collateral Transfer 11/15 \nCASS FSA 2011/56 1.10.11 \nand Liens Amendment) Instrument 2011  \nSupervision Manual (Amendment No 18) 11/11 \nSUP FSA 2011/57 1.10.11 \nInstrument 2011 (Ch 9) \nTo follow   FSA 2011/58  \nIntegrated Regulatory Reporting (Amendment 11/7 \nSUP FSA 2011/59 1.10.11 \nNo 12) Instrument 2011 (Ch 7) \nTo follow   FSA 2011/60  \nCompensation Sourcebook (Occupational 11/11 \nCOMP FSA 2011/61 1.10.11 \nPension Scheme Trustees) Instrument 2011 (Ch 7) \n \nColumn 2 (?CP?) shows the number of the corresponding consultation paper, where relevant.   \n \nWhere the acronym of a module in Column 3 appears in bold, that module is the main one affected by the \ninstrument shown, and changes made by that instrument are described in Chapter 2 or 3 under that module \nheading. \n 36  Handbook Notice 113 Annex B \n \nTable of Handbook modules showing amending instruments \n \n1.

Sometimes. Maybe.\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    When I stop to think about it, I have the impression that a number of museums and galleries that I used to hear from regularly have given up asking me to translate catalogue texts, since I rarely have time for extra work. When I do translate texts about painting there is usually a particular reason for it - an author or curator that I especially like, for instance – but just before I start working on a text about painting, I'm invariably annoyed with myself for agreeing to do it. I think I'm not interested in painting; the kind of art that is important to me doesn't involve pictures.\n\nYet as I was recently working on translating a text by an author I especially like, in which he discussed the history of still-life painting at some length, I found myself being more and more drawn into that history. I wished I had more time to read the articles I found in the course of looking for the accepted titles of historical paintings and the spelling of ancient Greek names in English. I wished I could spend the rest of the day reading in my thick lexicon of art history from one reference to the next and just sit there gazing at the pictures with these texts to find every detail. Even without all the extra reading I didn't have time for, when I was finished I felt as though I had just completed a whole art history course on still-life painting, and I found myself realizing how much I have learned from paintings.\n  \n\n  \n    \tAileen's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t327 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Open-Ended Strategies for Curation--Are they possible? Do they work?\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    Jon Bird and Andy Webster, an artificial life researcher and an artist, have been collaborating for the last five years on all sorts of very interesting projects. This past weekend, at the very interesting 'Artists, Curators, and the Screen' conference in Portsmouth, organised by Garrett Monaghan, I heard Bird speak about what they call 'Open-ended Strategies for Curation.' Over the last year or so, I have been musing on what may become my own 'open-ended’ curatorial approach, and so I was very interested to hear what he had to say. \n\nI was a bit disappointed when Bird opened his presentation with a quotation from Hans Ulrich-Obrist, who to my mind epitomises all that could possibly be problematic about 'open-endedness' in curating: one of the prominent members of Nicolas Bourriaud's 'Relational Aesthetics' clique, Obrist and the like advocate openness and the creation of community within exhibitions yet, tempting though this may sound, in practice many ‘relational’ artists and curators fail, as Claire Bishop rightly points out, I think, to ask ‘what types of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?’ (October 110, Fall 2004, 65) The quotation came from Obrist's article, Evolutionary Exhibitions, and like much or the rhetoric surrounding Relational Aesthetics, it was quite seductive:\n  \n\n  \n    \tlaurenawright's blog\n\t2 comments\n\tRead more\n\t510 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Making up words\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    Looking for something else one day, I happened to find an entry in Wiktionary for the word \"thematise\", which included the explanation that the word is a European neologism. I was glad to read that, because it is much easier to use a single, simple word like \"thematise\" than to have to find an elegant solution to explain that a certain point has been made a topic for discussion in a certain context.\n\nI think it is a common misconception that English-speaking people assume that everything said or written in English is said or written in \"their\" language. That is sometimes the case, but more often English is used as a means of communication among people without a common language. That is more obvious in face-to-face communication, where people can use hands and feet and facial expressions and sketches on napkins to get the message across. A statement like \"I look for anybodies out there\" may be perfectly comprehensible in the context of an international meeting, even though it would never get past an English teacher, but it is not really acceptable for a text that is to be published in some form. Finding the best way to communicate the author's idea is often a question of finding a reasonable compromise, because the \"right\" words are not always \"real\" words.\n  \n\n  \n    \tAileen's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t457 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  critiquing participatory practices etc\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    \"With the adaptation, or rather the perversion of emancipatory practices of the 1970s, the field of cultural policies increasingly becomes a space of action for neoliberal governmentality: participation becomes obligatory, creativity becomes an imperative, transparency becomes total surveillance, life-long learning turns into a threat, education means permanent social control, and grassroots democracy means developing software that applicants for cultural funding can use to evaluate one another. Diverse outsourcing models and mediator positions form a network of dependencies, operating in a way that is far more complex and thorough than the old lord – vassal hierarchy of cultural support in the past. Autonomous cultural initiatives meet with a fate similar to that of the autonomous genius-artist; specifically in the precarious aspect of their autonomy, they become necessary agents of governmentality control.\"\n  \n\n  \n    \tRuth Catlow's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t229 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Bollocks Hearts and Minds\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    \nJust watched All the Presidents Men - about Bernstein and Woodwood's journalistic investigation into the Watergate scandal which revealed a government level conspiracy to bismirch and undermine the authority of their political opponents by all kinds of dirty tricks - or what they refered to as 'rat-fucking'. \n\n\"When you've got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow.\"\n(puts a whole new slant on Blair's quest for hearts and minds).\n\nThe kind of aggressive journalism depicted in the film is the perfect balance to concentrations of political power.

We've never had a discussion list for node.london, just the forum at the now-archaic and spammed-up http://smal.omweb.org. Perhaps that's why we've not had 'A Discussion', but many discussions. I think that has been useful. I learned more that way. I like it that nobody has talked about it bombasticaly on mailing lists, that it was off the radar of most cultural institutions, that you never got one story, and never from one place.\n  \n\n  \n    \tfurtherfield's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t267 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  VisitorsStudio Context Map\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    VisitorsStudio is a Media Art project, in that it is “art through and with electronic digital media... a hybrid of electronically generated images, sounds, machine processes and possibilities for interaction”[1]. In addition to this definition by media, and equally important to an understanding of the VisitorsStudio project, is how it corresponds with processes, and practices developed by an earlier generation of artists associated with the Fluxus movement who worked with mail art, happenings, performance, art-activism and live art. This text describes some of these connections with past works and then positions VisitorsStudio within the thriving      territory of real-time art, software art, net art and participative and collaborative expression in contemporary ‘remix culture’.\n  \n\n  \n    \tfurtherfield's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t241 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Does media art change the understanding of the term art itself?\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    Media Art, or what many call New Media Art is gradually changing our understanding, perception and relationship to Art, reshaping its culture. It has significantly introduced new technological elements to the contemporary experience of Art world-wide. These elements are new ingredients changing the flavour of art as we know it. The 'technology' used in Media Art is the interface to the art; it provides one of the contexts when engaging with the meaning of the work. These digital networks are nothing without the humans who creatively use the technology to create its real purpose and meaning, they give it breath.\n  \n\n  \n    \tMarc Garrett's blog\n\tlogin to reply\n\tRead more\n\t493 reads\n\n  \n\n\n\n  The Revolution of Everyday Life\n\n  25 October 2010 - 3:15pm\n  \n    The Revolution of Everyday Life - Raoul Vaneigem. For me, this book is the accompaniment to The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord. I’m often calling into action the ideas of Situationism and political writings to draw some conclusions about what I’m exploring in media (mediated?) arts. Why do I attempt to do this? I’m not sure. I have no fixed agenda in this regard. I merely find that it is both an interesting framework to hang some of the ideas upon, and allows me space to explore some of those ideas for myself. To see how much I’ve understood.

Guido?s favourite figure is that more people would rather not go for a drink with either Miliband or Cameron, but the other figures are rather intriguing.\n\nLabour are ahead, but not thanks to their leader.\n\nTories are behind, but it could be a lot worse without Dave.\n\nThe recent plots have been on the wrong team?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Dave, Miliband, Polls\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 4:20 pm  \n\n\nComments (80)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP LibDems Live Conference Lobbyist High Life\n\n\n\n\nThe LibDem conference should by all accounts be an excuse for Clegg and co to distance themselves fromÂ theirÂ Tory counterparts, but it looks like they will be partying like the 1% next week.Â While Tories will remain under a strict champagne ban, Ashdown and Farron will be chugging kir, champagne andÂ canapÃ©s thanks to spinmeisters Guide Consultancy. VIPs are being invited to drink with the grandees in an invite-only Brighton penthouse.\n\nThe lobbyists claim to haveÂ ?stocked up on some great wine, not the usual conference fare? -Â presumably as a thank you to the LibDems for their abject failure to introduce lobbying reforms thus far, despite all theÂ promises.Â Bottoms up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Drunk, LibDems, Lobbyist\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 4:07 pm  \n\n\nComments (28)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouglas Murray muses:\n\n?It has become a staple of US election coverage that any Democratâ??s foreign policy fumble is a â??mis-speakâ?? while any Republican saying something even mildly contentious â?? as opposed to wrong â?? is a world-class clanger which shows them to be unfit for office.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 3:46 pm  \n\n\nComments (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStella?s State Slashing Summer Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a low-key interview over the summer, Labour?s Stella CreasyÂ declared herself a member of the reality based community. She told Patrick Wintour of the GuardianÂ that the main focus of an incoming Labour government must be value for money. Therefore they would have toÂ ?reassess every single item of departmental public spending in response to mounting government debt and the pressure on public resources.?Â The interview won her plaudits from the likesÂ of ConservativeHome and the Taxpayers? Alliance.\n\nThe Zero Base Policy is an idea advocated by the Adam Smith Institute and they?re delighted that it?s gaining traction in Parliament:\n\n?It?s great to see that Stella Creasy has been reading some Adam Smith Institute publications. Now that she?s read Zero Base Policy, she should try Madsen Pirie?s ?Economics Made Simple? and Eamonn Butler?s ?The Alternative Manifesto? to learn that you can?t spend your way out of a recession.?\n\n\nWhile you might think all this praise from sensible types will blot Stella?s copy book in the eyes of her deluded LabourÂ colleagues, quite the opposite has happened. Instead,Â LabourList readers have named her as their MP of the Month-Â Â not only for her campaign against Wonga, but as the site notes, her Zero Base work too.Â There is a lesson for Labour there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Debt, Labour Party, Totty Watch, Wonks\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 1:47 pm  \n\n\nComments (127)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour Wonks Awarded Â£50,000 Coalition Contract\n\n\n\n\nIn rare moment of unsoundness Mad Frankie Maude has announced that Labour wonk-shop IPPR is to be given aÂ ?groundbreaking? policyÂ formation role at the heart of the Coalition government.Â Guido supposes Frankie could hardly have chosen IPPR?s reality-based rivals Policy Exchange given he founded them with Minister Nick Boles and that Michael Gove is a former chairman. Instead theÂ EU and union-funded IPPR will be given Â£50,000 of taxpayers? money to research civil service reforms around the world.\n\nUPDATE: PX get in touch to point out that they do not take public money and therefore would not have entered this government commissioning project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Tories, Wonks\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 12:10 pm  \n\n\nComments (110)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalls Tells Business: I?m Just Like Osborne\n\n\n\n\nAfter his vote winning booing at the TUC, Ed Balls has donned his bow-tie toÂ butter upÂ the CBI.Â Though he won?t say it on the airwaves, behind closed doors with businessmen the Shadow Chancellor is desperate to play up the resemblance between himself and George Osborne:\n\n?George Osborne and I have some real differences but we also have some areas where we really agree.Â There is no doubt that a credible deficit reduction plan is essential? There have to be tough decisions on spending and pay and measures to kick-start the economy.Â We need action now for growth, jobs and confidence.?\n\n\nIt rolls off the tongue of the former City Minister. \n\nAnd it?s clear where he has got hisÂ inspirationÂ - Osborne?s Mansion House speech in June:\n\n?My conclusion from that the balance of risks in the UK argues strongly in favour of credible deficit reduction? A time for decisions has come. The common challenge is [how to] create the conditions for sustainable growth and new jobs? I will take action [to] inject new confidence into our financial system.?\n\n\nWhat is the point of the Shadow Chancellor if he?s just an echo?Â \n\nUPDATE: A source close to Osborne tells Guido:\n\n?Looking forward to BallsÂ announcingÂ this deficit reduction plan at Labour conference, but not holding our breath. So where is this Balls deficit plan?

As Piers Goes on Holiday\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiers Morgan has found the ratings battle with his CNN colleagues particularly difficult over recent months. Time and time again the likes of silver-haired Anderson Cooper and prime time eye candy Erin Burnett have knocked Piers down the pecking order. Not last week however. Guido thought he would have to begrudgingly admit that Piers had turned things round when he saw that his old foe had topped CNN?s ratings for Friday night. According to MediaLite Piers Morgan Tonight was on top form:\n\n\n\nJust the one caveat. Piers was actually away last week filming his latest series of Life Stories for ITV. Friday night?s ratings-winning episode of Piers Morgan Tonight was hosted in Morgan?s absence by rival Wolf Blitzer. Even his own show does better when it?s hosted by someone else, just the message Piers wants to send to his bosses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Media Guido, Piers Morgan\n\nSeptember 19, 2012 at 9:09 am  \n\n\nComments (64)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, September 18, 2012\n\n\nEvan Harris Actually on Drugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you missed the much-maligned Professor David Nutt on Radio 4 this morning, then Guido would highly recommend catching up on the interview here. His research into using drugs like ecstasy and magic mushrooms to treatÂ depressionÂ or to allow victims of trauma to open up about their experiences was fascinating. It?s now emerged that former LibDem MP Evan Harris will be taking party in Nutt?s Channel Four show which will look at the effects of MDMA. The usual crowd are shocked andÂ appalledÂ that a former MP will be dropping a bean live on TV.Â Guido had always presumed Evan Harris was on drugs anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Drugs, Freedom to

          "Paper 3\n\n\nHealth\nand Social Care Committee\n\n\nHSC(4)-07-12\npaper 3\n\n\nInquiry\ninto residential care for older people ? Evidence from Action\non Hearing Loss Cymru, RNIB Cymru and Sense\n\n \n\n   \n  \n\nAbout\nus\n\nAction on\nHearing Loss Cymru\n\nAction on\nHearing Loss Cymru is the new name for RNID Cymru. We're the\ncharity working for a Wales where hearing loss doesn't limit or\nlabel people, where tinnitus is silenced ? and where people\nvalue and look after their hearing.\n\n \n\nCare & Support Services is\nthe largest component of the Action on Hearing Loss group. We\nsupport Deaf and hard of hearing adults, some of whom have\nadditional needs such as learning disabilities, mental health,\nphysical disabilities and dual sensory loss. Nearly a third of our\nservice users (27 per cent) in residential care in Wales and the\nSouth West of England are over the age of 60.\n\n \n\nRNIB\nCymru\n\nRNIB\nCymru works\non behalf of an estimated 115,000 people in Wales with sight loss.\nWe campaign to create a society more inclusive of people with sight\nloss and we promote eye health by running public health awareness\ncampaigns. We also work in partnership with organisations across\nWales to provide local services, providing practical solutions to\neveryday challenges.\n\n \n\nSense\n\nSense Cymru is the leading\ncharity in Wales that supports and campaigns for children and\nadults who are deafblind. We provide expert advice and information\nas well as specialist services to deafblind people, their families,\ncarers and the professionals who work with them.  Sense Cymru\nprovides community services, including communicator-guide services,\nin many areas of Wales, working closely with local authorities who\ncommission these services.\n\n \n\nDeafblindness is a combination\nof both sight and hearing difficulties. Most of what we learn about the world comes through our\nears and eyes, so deafblind people face major problems with\ncommunication, access to information and mobility. People can be\nborn deafblind, or become deafblind through illness, accident or in\nolder age.\n\n \n\nVocabulary\n\nThroughout this response we use\nthe term 'people with hearing loss' to refer to people with all\nlevels of hearing loss, including people who are profoundly\ndeaf.\n\n \n\nThis response uses the term\n?people with sight loss? to refer to any people who are\nliving with significant sight loss, and some have vision which is\nequivalent to people who are partially sighted or blind.\n\n \n\nPeople with hearing and sight\nloss are referred to in this response as people with dual sensory\nloss.\n\n \n\nThe term ?people with\nsensory loss? is used to refer to people with hearing, sight\nor dual sensory loss. \n\n \n\nOur response\n\nAs laid out in the introduction\n(below) there is a high proportion of people with sensory loss in\nWales. As the population ages there will be an increase in the\nlevels of people with sensory loss, together with a likely\nincreased need for residential care. It is critical that current\nand future providers of residential care are able to meet the needs\nof people with sensory loss in Wales ? providing people with\nan exemplar service and meaningful choice in terms of residential\ncare provision.\n\n \n\nThe effect of\nsensory loss, single or dual, is underestimated in relation to\nsocial isolation, loss of independence, mental ill health,\nnutrition and wellbeing. People with sensory loss are more likely\nto have difficulty with moderate exercise, mental stimulation,\nmaintaining social contact and healthy eating resulting in poor\nhealth outcomes.\n\n \n\nWith the right\nadvice and support, such as one-to-one assistance, mobility and\ncommunication training or equipment, people with sensory loss can\nbe enabled to live active and healthy lives, maintain independence,\nbe socially active and maintain good mental health.\n\n \n\nThe common\nperception that sensory loss in older people is an inevitable part\nof ageing should be resisted. Many older people's sight and / or\nhearing can be enhanced or maintained, and a great deal can be done\nto help someone to use the remaining sight and hearing that they do\nhave.\n\n \n\n\nSense have provided\nthis powerful example of what the process of entering residential\ncare can be like for someone with dual sensory loss.\n\n\n \n\n\n?Sheila is an\nelderly deafblind woman who lived alone for the whole of her adult\nlife. Until her sensory impairments degenerated significantly in\nher early eighties, Sheila had an active life, took part in the\nW.I. and helped with the reading programme at a local\nschool.\n\n\n \n\n\nSheila was only\ngiven 2 hours per fortnight of a combination of paid and voluntary\nsupport. She became increasingly confused due to her deafblindness\nand the decision was made, against Sheila?s wishes, to place\nher in residential care.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe staff at the\nhome do not know how to support her, for example they leave her\nfood on a tray in front of her but don?t communicate with\nSheila to tell her that her food is there and as a result Sheila\nmay go hungry. Sheila has depression and talks of\nsuicide.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Sense\nprofessional working with Sheila firmly believes that if Sheila had\nbeen given 2 hours per day of communicator guide support at an\nearly stage to help her to readjust to her sensory impairments and\nthereafter 3 hours twice a week of one to one support, then Sheila\ncould have remained in her own home.? \n\n \n\nThe following example, also from\nSense, highlights the impact of inadequate recognition of sensory\nloss on an individual:\n\n \n\nSense Cymru has recently been\ninvolved with an elderly lady with ?challenging\nbehaviour? who was placed in a North Wales residential care\nhome by an English Local Authority.  On investigation, this\n?challenging behaviour? was found to largely emanate\nfrom frustration.  The person was deafblind, but she could\nread Braille fluently and communicated by using deafblind manual\nalphabet. However, none of these skills/needs were picked up during\nthe assessment or provided for in the residential\nestablishment.  The case was brought to the attention of Sense\nCymru not through any systematic process, but by a basic grade care\nworker who had some personal knowledge of deafblindness. The lady\ndied before the situation could be rectified.\n\n \n\nOur response will focus on key\nissues that relate to people with hearing loss, sight loss and dual\nsensory loss.\n\n \n\nWe have set out a series of\nrecommendations which, if implemented, would help people in\nresidential care in Wales lead more full and active\nlives.\n\n \n\nWe cannot answer every question\nbut have chosen to respond to the part of this call for evidence\nwhere we feel we can add value to the Inquiry.\n\n \n\nWe are happy for the details of\nthis response to be made public.\n\n \n\nIntroduction\n\n\nSense has recently\ncarried out some research into hearing and sight loss amongst older\npeople in care homes (Sue Pavey, Manveet Patel, Liz Hodges, Graeme\nDouglas, and Anna McGee (2011) The Identification and Assessment of\nthe Needs of Older People with Combined Hearing and Sight Loss in\nResidential Homes, University of Birmingham). They plan to submit a\nfull copy of the research findings to the inquiry, but these are\nsome key points from the findings:\n\n\n·        \nThe concept of\ncombined hearing and sight loss was broadly unfamiliar to both\nstaff and residents.\n\n\n·        \nSimple strategies to\nhelp people with combined hearing and sight loss to manage, such as\na loop system, large print newspapers, and different coloured\nplates could help.\n\n\n·        \nMedical and clinical\nappointments related to hearing and vision are very important in\nmonitoring deterioration in sight or hearing. Many residents were\nunaware of when they had last seen, or would next see, a\nclinician.\n\n\n·        \nFew homes, and\ntherefore residents, had any contact with voluntary organisations\nrelated to hearing or sight loss, or the services and support they\ncould provide.\n\n\n·        \nWhile residents were\nappreciative of the efforts of staff for their care, staff had\nlittle training in sensory loss (particularly combined sensory\nloss) and were often too busy to spend much time with\nresidents.\n\n\n \n\nPrevalence of hearing\nloss\n\n\tIt is estimated that there are 534,000 people with hearing\nloss in Wales.\n\tMore than 300,000 people would benefit from using hearing\naids ? 1 in 10 of the population (10%).\n\tAlmost two out of three people (65%) with hearing loss are\nover the age of 65. \n\n\n \n\nBecause of the ageing\npopulation, the number of people with hearing loss is set to grow\nby 14% every 10 years.\n\n \n\nAbout people with hearing\nloss\n\nDepression, anxiety,\nstress\n\nResearch reveals that people\nwith hearing loss have a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety\nand stress. A recent study shows that older people with hearing\nloss are 2.45 times more likely to develop depression than those\nwithout hearing loss.[1]\n\n \n\nDementia\n\nRecent research\nalso shows that people with mild hearing loss have nearly twice the\nchance of developing dementia compared to people with normal\nhearing. The risk increases threefold for those with moderate and\nfivefold for severe hearing loss.[2]\n\n \n\nFalls\n\nPeople with hearing\nloss are highly likely to have problems such as tinnitus and\nbalance disorders which contribute as risk factors for falls and\nother accidental injuries.\n\n \n\nLearning\nDisabilities\n\nIt has been\nsuggested that almost 40 per cent of adults with a learning\ndisability will have a hearing loss yet for many people the loss\nwill not be diagnosed because their audiology services are not\naccessible to them. For many, the loss will be identified but the\nsupport they receive may not be adequate for them to benefit from a\nhearing aid.\n\n \n\nThe consequences can\nbe a double disadvantage, their learning disability precludes them\nfrom receiving adequate support for their hearing problem and the\nfailure to address their hearing loss will in turn exacerbate the\neffects of their learning disability.  More research needs to\nbe undertaken in this area to ensure the provision of appropriate\nservices.\n\n \n\nOn average, there is a 10-year\ndelay in people seeking help with their hearing loss\n\nEarly\ndiagnosis and intervention is fundamental to preventing and\nreducing the impact of hearing loss, supporting independence and\nwellbeing and preventing mental ill health. However, on average,\nthere is a 10-year delay in people seeking help with their hearing\nloss.\n\n \n\nPrevalence of sight\nloss\n\n·        \nThere are an\nestimated 115,000 people with sight loss in Wales.\n\n·        \n1 in 5 people over\nthe age of 70 have a significant sight loss.\n\n·        \n1 in 2 over the age\nof 90.\n\n \n\nThe number of people with sight\nloss will double in the next 25 years.\n\n \n\nSight loss isn?t confined\nto those who are registered blind and partially sighted. It\nincludes people who are waiting for, or having, treatment such as\nlaser or other surgery to improve their sight. And it includes\npeople whose vision loss could be improved by wearing the right\nglasses.\n\n \n\nAbout people with sight\nloss\n\nDepression and\nsuicide\n\n·        \n35 per cent of older\npeople with sight loss are living with some form of depression.\n(Hodge, Barr and Knox (2010) Evaluation of Emotional Support and\nCounselling within an Integrated Low Vision Services. University of\nLiverpool.\n\n \n\n·              \nOlder people with\nsight loss are three times more likely to experience depression\nthan people with good vision.\n\n \n\n·              \nThe British Medical\nJournal reports that sight loss is one of the top three causes of\nsuicide among older people.\n\n \n\nStroke\nand sight\nloss\n\nThere is a high prevalence of\nsight loss amongst people who have had a stroke. A systematic\nreview of prevalence of sight loss in stroke patients is due for\npublication by RNIB shortly, but visual impairment is reported in\nthe region of 70% of stroke survivors.\n\n \n\nDementia and sight\nloss\n\nIt is estimated the number of\npeople over 75 years with dementia and sight loss, based on the\ndata for each individual morbidity, to be 2.5 per cent. However,\nthis figure is likely to be an under-estimate because visual\nimpairment studies will not have accounted for individuals that are\nconsidered ?untestable?.  It is important to\ndiagnose both dementia and sight loss in order to maximise the\ntreatment and care of the individual, as the degree to which a\nperson with dementia is able to cope will be influenced by sight\nloss\n\n \n\nFalls\n\nHistorically, falls were\naccepted as an unavoidable problem of advancing years and frailty.\nHowever, there is now a large-body of evidence based research that\nconsiders that such events can be predicted and prevented.\nEffective interventions are important and can result in significant\nbenefits with regard to improving individual\nwell-being. \n\n           \n\n·        \nApproximately 60 per\ncent of people living in care homes experience recurrent falls each\nyear.\n\n \n\n·        \nPoor eyesight is one\nof three major risk factors contributing to falls among older\npeople leading to accidents and death.\n\n \n\n·        \nOlder people with\nsight problems are almost twice as likely to have a fall, and have\n90 per cent higher odds of multiple falls than a person without\nvisual impairment.\n\n \n\n·        \nFalling has been\nidentified as a major complication in people who have had a stroke.\nIt has been estimated that up to 70 per cent of individuals who\nreturn home after a stroke will fall especially during the first\nfew months and this could result in a move to long term\ncare.\n\n \n\n·        \nRecurrent falls are\nassociated with increased disability and are the leading cause of\ndeath resulting from injury in people aged 75 years and over. Age\nUK reported in 2010 that an older person dies every five hours as a\nresult of a fall.\n\n \n\n \n\nLearning Disabilities\n\n\n·        \nPeople with learning\ndisabilities are 10 times more likely to have serious sight\nproblems than other people. People with severe or profound learning\ndisabilities are most likely to have sight problems\n\n \n\n\n·        \n6 in 10 people with\nlearning disabilities need glasses and often need support to get\nused to them. People with learning disabilities may not know they\nhave a sight problem and may not be able to tell people.  Many\npeople think the person with a learning disability they know can\nsee perfectly well.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe BME population\n\nPeople from black and minority\nethnic communities are at greater risk of some of the leading\ncauses of sight loss. 5 per cent of the population of Wales may\nfall into this category.\n\n \n\nPrevalence of people with dual\nsensory loss\n\n \n\n\n·        \nIt is estimated 18,850 people in Wales are currently affected\nby both visual and hearing impairments. \n\n \n\n\n·        \n212 per 100,000 will\nhave a loss of a severity to classify them as deafblind.\n\n \n\n\n·        \n62 per cent of the\ndeafblind population is aged over 70\n\n \n\n\n·        \nThe number of people who are both deaf and blind is estimated\nto grow by 60 per cent in 20 years (2030) largely driven by general\ndemographic change.\n\n \n\n\n·        \nPeople over 70 will be most affected with an 87 per cent\nincrease by 2030.\n\n \n\nFigures based on prevalence\nstatistics and the Centre for Disability Research, 2010 report:\nEstimating the Number of People with Co-Occurring Vision and\nHearing Impairments in the UK.\n\n \n\n\nThe terms of\nreference\n\n\nAs described above,\nwe cannot answer all the terms of reference, but have included\nrelevant terms of reference to make clear which point we are\nreferring to.\n\n\n \n\n-              \nthe\nprocess by which\nolder people enter residential care and the availability and\naccessibility of alternative community-based services, including\nreablement services and domiciliary\ncare.\n\n\n \n\n\nCare and Social\nServices Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW)\n\n\nDuring 2012-2014\nAction on Hearing Loss Cymru, RNIB Cymru and Sense Cymru will be\nworking with the CSSIW and the Care Forum Wales on how residential\ncare homes can better meet the needs of people with sensory\nloss.\n\n\nWe hope this\npartnership will include different strands of work including an\nexpert users group and help make sure that CSSIW are aware of the\nneeds of people with sensory loss in residential care in Wales. The\npaper submitted to CSSIW is attached to this document.\n\n\n \n\n\nPerson centred\nplanning\n\n\nWe believe that it\nis important to make sure that people with sensory loss are given\nchoice and control.  Service users need to be at the centre of\nthe Care Planning process from the beginning and they need to be\nprovided with clear information so they can make informed choices .\nThis will mean that not only are people?s needs catered for\nin terms of their sensory loss, but also in terms of their other\nneeds (eg. medical, cultural, social etc). We believe that everyone\nwith a sensory loss should be able to plan and be in control of the\nsupport they will receive.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Person Centred\nplan should be drawn up with the full involvement of the service\nuser. This is not possible unless you can establish meaningful\ncommunication. It must also be recorded in a format which is easily\naccessible to the service user.\n\n\n \n\nRegular eye and hearing\nchecks\n\nRegular checks should be part of\nthe individual's Personal Plan. This should be recorded and\nmonitored. This applies to all service users within residential\ncare, not just those with a previously diagnosed sensory loss.\nDiagnosis is essential in terms of ensuring the appropriate care\nand support.\n\n\n \n\n\nInformation\n\n\nInformation should\nbe made available in a range of formats, so that people are kept\ninformed and given a meaningful choice. Information should be\nproduced as standard in Clear Print, Plain English / Clir Cymraeg\nand be available in Braille, large print, audio, electronic,\nBritish Sign language (BSL) and Sign Supported English\n(SSE).\n\n\n \n\n\nIt is important this\ninformation is available in an appropriate format and in a timely\nfashion. It is also important to consider that friends and family\nwho are helping the individual to make a choice about residential\ncare, or may in some instances be taking that decision for them\n(for example, if they have Power of Attorney), may have sensory\nloss. Their needs must be considered along with the service\nuser.\n\n\n \n\n\nOne of the factors\ncausing people with sensory loss to enter residential care is the\nlack of adequate support in the community to meet specialist needs\nrelated to sensory loss, as illustrated by the example of Sheila in\nthe introduction to this response. Rapid identification of sensory\nloss and provision of adequate reablement and long term support\ncould reduce the need for residential care.\n\n\n \n\n-              \nthe capacity of\nthe residential care sector to meet the demand for services from\nolder people in terms of staffing resources, including the skills\nmix of staff and their access to training, and the number of places\nand facilities, and resource levels.\n\n\n \n\n\nGiven the prevalence\nof sensory loss amongst older people it is essential that any\nprovider of services to this group, including the residential care\nsector, has the skills and knowledge to meet their needs. The\nresearch quoted earlier indicates that staff have little training\nin this area.  Sense produced some guidance for care home and\nhome care providers on supporting people with dual sensory loss,\ncalled ?Seeing Me?.\n\n\n \n\n\nSensory loss will\naffect many aspects of a person?s life in residential\ncare:\n\n\n \n\n\nTraining and\nequipment\n\n\nTraining for staff\nis absolutely crucial to ensure that they are able to meet the\nneeds of people with sensory loss in residential care. This\nincludes communication techniques, understanding of sensory loss,\nhow to operate and maintain equipment, including hearing aids and\nloop systems.\n\n\n \n\n\nService users should\nhave the specialist equipment they require to maximise their\nindependence. For people with a dual sensory loss this will include\na range of high and low tech equipment. Loop systems can help\nanyone who uses a hearing aid to hear speech or the TV. Magnifiers\ncan help with reading. A specialist assessment may be necessary to\nidentify the best solutions, including tactile markers, vibrating\nalarm clocks, task lighting.\n\n\n \n\n\nAction on Hearing\nLoss Cymru has also worked with CSSIW and the University of\nManchester to create the attached report: ?Older people\nwho use BSL ? preferences for residential care provision in\nWales? (2010). This extract from the report makes the\ncase for deaf awareness training in residential care:\n\n\n \n\n\n?Deaf\nawareness within residential care homes\n\n\nWhilst being able to\ncommunicate in one?s own and preferred language within a\nresidential setting was the main concern of those interviewed, all\nin different ways also highlighted the importance of Deaf awareness\nwithin the living environment of residential care homes.\n\n\nWhen the one current\nresident we interviewed was asked what she enjoyed doing in the\nhome, she at first could not answer. When prompted that she might\nlike watching television with the other residents she said\n?no? because the subtitles on the TV were never\nswitched on and in fact the staff did not actually know how to do\nthis. Other respondents also raised the issue of inaccessible\ntelevision within the broader context of communication\nisolation.\n\n\n \n\n\nHowever, not all\nDeaf people of that generation would necessarily be good readers as\none respondent pointed out, thus further reinforcing the\nsignificance of face to face communication. Television as a proxy\nmeans of keeping up with what was going on in the world, or simply\nfor entertainment, was not for some Deaf people a viable option,\neven if subtitles were to be switched on.\n\n\nHowever, good Deaf\nawareness in residential care was also strongly linked by those we\ninterviewed, to supporting residents? independence and sense\nof control within their living environments. For example, several\nrespondents discussed the provision of vibrating pagers/alerters to\nresidents so they could be aware if there was an emergency or a\nfire alarm and so they could alert staff in a timely manner to\ntheir distress.?\n\n\n \n\nSocial contact and\nactivities\n\nKeeping active is vital to\nkeeping healthy as we get older. Enabling people to maintain\nleisure and social activities and cultural interests will require\nthought about what support the person needs to do this. People who\nappear to no longer be interested in activities they previously\nenjoyed may simply be finding them too difficult due to sensory\nloss and steps need to be taken to make these activities accessible\nagain.\n\n \n\nFood, meals and\nmealtimes\n\nFor people with sight loss,\neating can be difficult. Dining rooms can be noisy, making speech\ndifficult to understand. If a person?s hearing and sight loss\nis severe, it is essential that they know the food is\nthere.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe\nenvironment\n\n\nIt is critical that\nthe environment is suitable for people with sensory loss ?\ntaking into account the need for good colour contrast to help, for\nexample, identify doorways and preventing falls.\n\n\n \n\n\nGood environmental\ndesign aids independence and reduces the risk of falls. It has also\nbeen reported by a large Care provider in England that utilising\ngood design principles also reduced the levels of\nincontinence.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe environment must\nalso be suitable for someone with a hearing loss ? with loop\nsystems maintained to aid communication. Without this people may\nbecome isolated and unable to participate in group\nactivities.\n\n\n \n\nRNIB have also produced\nguidance \"Seeing\nit from their side\".\nA guide to recognising and\nsupporting sight loss in your care home, which is\nattached.\n\n\n \n\n\nRNIB Cymru have\ndesigned ?Visibly Better?, an accreditation scheme\ndeveloped to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of people\nwith sight problems who live in sheltered housing and extra care\nhomes. While RNIB assumes that tenants living in sheltered housing\nreceive a quality service in all aspects of life within their\nhousing environment, ?Visibly Better? is focused on\nimproving the service and equality of rights for clients who have\nsight loss.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis type of scheme\ncould be used in residential care to ensure they are meeting the\nneeds of people with sensory loss.\n\n\n \n\n-              \nthe quality of\nresidential care services and the experiences of service users and\ntheir families; the effectiveness of services at meeting the\ndiversity of need amongst older people; and the management of care\nhome closures.\n\n \n\nEquality Act 2010\n\nResidential care homes need to\ntake the needs of people with sensory loss into account. If due\nregard is not taken of residents? sensory loss, residential\ncare homes will be in breach of the Act by;\n\n\n·                    \nnot removing or\nminimising disadvantages experienced by people due to their\nprotected characteristics\n\n\n·                    \nnot taking steps to\nmeet the needs of people from protected groups where these are\ndifferent from the needs of other people\n\n \n\nCommissioning\n\nProviding for the sensory loss\nof an individual is not currently seen as a significant factor in\ncurrent commissioning processes.  Consequently services are\nbeing provided which may be totally unsuited to individual need,\nleading to unnecessary isolation and additional risks to the\nindividual, commissioner and the provider.\n\n\n \n\n\nBritish Sign\nLanguage residents\n\n\nThe\n?Older\npeople who use BSL ? preferences for residential care\nprovision in Wales? (2010) report calls for a specific\nprovision for BSL users in Wales in order to meet the needs of BSL\nusers in residential care.\n\n\n \n\n\nCurrently people who\nare deaf can either be placed in a care home where they are likely\nto be the sole resident who is a BSL user or sent to one of the few\nspecialist care homes in England ? away from their family, as\nhighlighted by the report: \n\n\n \n\n\n?Arguments for\nspecialist residential care\n\n\nThe establishment of\nspecialist residential care provision for Deaf older people was\nstrongly supported by those who participated in the research. It\nwas not regarded as the one size fits all solution, but the\nrequirement for it to be resourced and available was argued because\nof:\n\n\n \n\n               \n? inadequacies\nof current provision which do not meet Deaf people?s\nlinguistic and cultural needs that are fundamental to their well\nbeing, safety and basic human rights\n\n\n \n\n               \n? the potential\ngrowth in demand as a result of the ageing population in general\nwhich equally applies to Deaf people\n\n\n \n\n               \n? the long\nstanding lobbying by Deaf citizens themselves\n\n\n \n\n               \n? the clear\nadvantages for the maintenance of personal independence, mental\nwell being and happiness that a supportive signing care environment\ncould create with other Deaf people.?\n\n\n \n\n\nA copy of this\nreport is attached.\n\n\n \n\n-              \nthe\neffectiveness of\nthe regulation and inspection arrangements for residential care,\nincluding the scope for increased scrutiny of service\nproviders? financial viability.\n\n\n \n\n\nSee work with CSSIW,\ndescribed above.\n\n \n\nRecommendations\n\n \n\nAwareness\ntraining\n\nIt is essential\nthat social care staff be aware of how to communicate with people\nwho have sensory loss and that their needs are taken into account\nin the design and management of residential care services. \nSensory loss awareness training should be part of initial and\nregular staff training.\n\n \n\nTraining packages already\nexistthat\ncan quickly improve practice, both with staff in residential care\nand with those who commission such services in line with the\nmandatory requirements of the new Qualification and Credit\nFramework [QCF], operational from 01/01/11.\n\n \n\nAccess to\ninformation\n\nInformation\nshould be made available in a variety of formats and communication\nsupport should be available, where necessary, at all stages of a\nperson's dealings with social services. For instance, service users\nshould be able to make an appointment with social services via\nemail or SMS text. All written information should be produced as\nstandard in Plain English/ Clir Cymraeg in at least size 12 arial\nfont (Clear Print). Information should be made available in audio;\nelectronic, large print, BSL, SSE, Easy Read and Braille\nformats.\n\n \n\nThe environment\n\nThe environment needs to be\nappropriate for people with sensory loss, including colour and\ntonal contrast, appropriate lighting and noise insulation. As a\nminimum, loop systems and fire strobes need to be in all communal\nareas, kept in good working order and how to maintain them included\nin training.\n\n \n\nPolicy and procedure\n\nResidential care homes need to\ninclude sensory loss throughout their policies and procedures,\nwhich could be included in the contract from the commissioning\nbody. This would also ensure compliance with the Equality Act and\nshould be included in CSSIW inspections procedure.\n\n \n\nPerson centred plan\n\nService users should be central\nin the planning of their stay in residential care. The plan should\nbe drawn up with meaningful communication with the service user and\nmade available in their preferred format. This plan should be\nshared with all staff and people involved in the care and support\nof the service user as appropriate. \n\n \n\nSensory Champions\n\nThe development of a\n?Sensory Champion? in each home would have a very\npositive effect in motivating colleagues and keeping this on the\nestablishments/company?s agenda.\n\n \n\nAccessing external services and\nsupport\n\nCare Homes often do not access\nthe wide range of external organisations that could support\nresidents, e.g local Visual Impairment societies, Age Cymru and\nSense. This support could reduce isolation and help individuals to\nmaximise wellbeing. Care Home providers should be encouraged to\nengage with external organisations through individuals' Person\nCentred Plans.\n\n \n\nCSSIW Inspector Training /\nAwareness raising\n\nInspectors should undergo\ntraining / awareness raising on sensory loss issues. This has been\nagreed with the CSSIW for 2012.\n\n \n\nMaintenance of hearing\naids\n\nStaff should be trained in\nmaintenance of hearing aids and regular maintenance recorded and\nmonitored.\n\n \n\nRegular eye and hearing\nchecks\n\nRegular checks should be part of\nthe individual's Personal Plan. This should be recorded and\nmonitored.\n\n \n\nWales Low Vision\nService\n\nCare Homes should be expected to\nutilise the Wales Low Vision Service if appropriate to ensure that\nindividual's vision is maximised.\n\n \n\nContact details:\n\nMary van den\nHeuvel\n\nPolicy and Research\nOfficer\n\nAction on Hearing Loss\nCymru\n\n16 Cathedral Road\n\nCardiff\n\nCF11 9LJ\n\n02920 907 523\n\nmary.vandenheuvel@hearingloss.org.uk\n\n \n\nAnsley\nWorkman\n\nHead of Independent\nLiving Services\n\nRNIB\nCymru\n\nTrident\nCourt\n\nEast Moors\nRoad\n\nCardiff\n\nCF24 5TD\n\n029 2044\n9584\n\nansley.workman@rnib.org.uk\n\n \n\nWayne\nLewis\n\nHead of\nServices\n\nSense \nCymru\n\nT?\nPenderyn,\n\n26 High\nStreet,\n\nMerthyr\nTydfil,\n\nCF47 8DP\n\n0845 127\n0090\n\nWayne.lewis@sense.org.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Saito H,\nNishiwaki Y, Michikawa T, Kikuchi Y, Mizutari K, Takebayashi T,\nOgawa K ?Hearing handicap predicts the development\nof depressive symptoms after 3 years in older community-dwelling\nJapanese?

WALES\n\n \n\nINQUIRY INTO THE GRANTING OF POWERS\n\n \n\nTO WELSH MINISTERS IN UK LAW\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\t\n \n\n \n\n31st August 2011\n\n \n\nDaniel\nGreenberg\n\nParliamentary\nCounsel, BLP\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF DANIEL\nGREENBERG[1]\n\n \n\n1                 \nsummary\n\n1.1             \nDevolution has significantly increased the complexity of the\nstatute book, making it harder for the citizen to piece together a\ntext of the law as it applies to his or her circumstances.\n\n1.2             \nThe recent acquisition by the National Assembly of enhanced\nlegislative powers may suggest both a need and an opportunity for\nrationalisation of the existing processes.\n\n1.3             \nOne aspect of this may be a move for powers to be conferred on\nWelsh Ministers by legislation of the National Assembly wherever\npossible.\n\n1.4             \nBut where that is not possible, the National Assembly may still\nwish to have a formal voice in respect of the nature and extent of\npowers to be conferred on  Welsh Ministers by Westminster\nlegislation, whether or not the substance of the relevant area of\nlaw is devolved.\n\n1.5             \nThis could be achieved by building on the existing National\nAssembly?s Standing Order 30 process so as to establish a\nformal consultative process between Cardiff and Westminster where\nit is proposed that a Westminster Bill should confer powers\ndirectly on Welsh Ministers.\n\n2                 \nbackground\n\n2.1             \nThe arrangements for devolution are already contributing to the\nfactors making the statute book almost impossibly complicated for\ncitizens to follow.\n\n2.2             \nIn particular, the emergence of an increasing number of\n?parallel texts?, as UK-wide legislation is variously\namended with differing degrees of extent, is making it increasingly\ndifficult to establish a clear picture of the legislative text in\nrelation to each jurisdiction.\n\n2.3             \nThe expansion of the National Assembly for Wales? powers as a\nresult of the positive result of the referendum on its Act-making\npowers offers various opportunities for rationalisation and\nconsolidation.  The National Assembly may consider this an\nopportunity to consider generally whether the process of\nlegislating is as streamlined as possible, with a view to making\nthe result simpler and easier to use.\n\n2.4             \nIn particular, the National Assembly may feel that it is consistent\nwith the increase in its legislative competence to ensure that\npowers to be exercised by Welsh Ministers are conferred by\nlegislation of the National Assembly wherever possible.\n\n2.5             \nIt is inevitable, however, that Westminster legislation will\ncontinue to need to confer powers on Welsh Ministers in some\ncontexts and circumstances.\n\n2.6             \nIn some circumstances the National Assembly will in practice be\nrequired[2]\nto consent to the conferring of powers on the Welsh Ministers by\nWestminster legislation.  As discussed below, however, this\nwill not always be the case. \n\n2.7             \nIn all circumstances, however, the National Assembly may wish to\nhave a formal opportunity to express views about the form in which,\nand the extent to which, powers are conferred.  In particular,\nthe National Assembly may consider this an important method\nof?\n\n(a)          \nensuring as consistent an approach as possible to the delegation of\npowers, with the aim of enhancing the overall clarity and\nsimplicity of the statute book, and\n\n(b)          \nexercising some degree of control or influence over the extent to\nwhich powers are conferred on Welsh Ministers other than by the\nNational Assembly.\n\n3                 \nthe memorandum of understanding\n\n3.1             \nThe Inter-governmental Memorandum of Understanding as revised on\n8th June 2011 reserves to the Westminster Parliament\n?authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or\nnot?[3].\n\n3.2             \nThere is a distinction to be drawn, which the Memorandum does not\naddress, between the substantive policy of Westminster legislation\nand the mechanisms by which it is to be given effect.  The\nquestion of conferring powers on Welsh Ministers concerns the\nlatter issue.\n\n3.3             \nWestminster legislation could purport to confer powers on Welsh\nMinisters either in relation to devolved or non-devolved areas of\nlaw.  The Memorandum would give the National Assembly a\npresumption of involvement in the former case, but not the\nlatter.\n\n3.4             \nIn all cases, however, the National Assembly may wish to have a\nvoice in respect of the arrangements for powers to be conferred on\nWelsh Ministers.\n\n4                 \nstanding order 30\n\n4.1             \nThe paper Provisions about Welsh Ministers in UK\nActs[4]\ndescribes the arrangements under Standing Order 30 (Notification in\nrelation to UK Parliament Bills).\n\n4.2             \nThe essential deficiency of these arrangements, however, is that\nthey are confined to consideration within the National Assembly,\nand give the National Assembly no kind of voice within the\nWestminster Parliament on the issues under consideration.\n\n4.3             \nIn essence, the arrangements are a dialogue within Cardiff, rather\nthan a dialogue between Cardiff and Westminster.\n\n4.4             \nThat gives the National Assembly an opportunity to make\nrepresentations to the Welsh Government about, in effect, the\nrepresentations that it makes to the UK Government.  It does\nnot enable the views of the National Assembly to be communicated\ndirectly to Parliament.\n\n4.5             \nOf course, the National Assembly cannot, by its Standing Orders or\notherwise, compel the Westminster Parliament to talk or listen to\nthe National Assembly.  But while the Standing Order 30\narrangements continue to be entirely unilateral there must be a\nlimit to their effectiveness as a means of communicating the\nNational Assembly?s concerns and interests to those\nresponsible for passing Westminster legislation.\n\n5                 \na new procedure for discussion between westminster and\ncardiff?\n\n5.1             \nIn order to address the problem described in sections 3 and 4\nabove, the National Assembly may wish to consider encouraging the\nestablishment of new arrangements within Whitehall and Westminster\nthat would, in effect, ensure that the National Assembly has an\nopportunity formally to influence the process where it is proposed\nto confer powers directly on Welsh Ministers.\n\n5.2             \nIn essence, both the UK Government and Parliament could be\nencouraged to establish arrangements that build on the existing\nStanding Order 30 procedure, and enable its results to be\nconsidered by the Westminster Parliament.\n\n5.3             \nThis would be in accordance with the aim set out in paragraph 4 of\nthe Memorandum of Understanding ?to allow administrations to\nmake representations to each other in sufficient time for those\nrepresentations to be fully considered?.\n\n5.4             \nThe new arrangements could lead to the strengthening of the effect\nof the Standing Order 30 arrangements in their present form. \nBy adding a new dimension to the dialogue - between the National\nAssembly and Parliament - the Welsh government would approach\nStanding Order 30 in the knowledge that it was one part of a\ndiscussion that could be expanded, and referred to, by Westminster\nParliamentarians with interest in Welsh affairs as the Bill\nproceeded through Parliament.\n\n5.5             \nKey features of the arrangements might include, for\nexample?\n\n(a) a requirement for the Minister in Charge\nof any Bill that conferred powers directly on the Welsh Ministers\nto submit a memorandum to the National Assembly before the Second\nReading of the Bill in its first House[5];\n\n(b) consideration of the memorandum in the\nNational Assembly, possibly in Committee and with the possibility\nof hearing evidence from Welsh Government or Westminster\nofficials;\n\n(c) the option for the National Assembly to\nagree a response, possibly by taking note of a Committee report,\nwhich would be transmitted to the Minister in Charge of the Bill\nand laid by him or her before Parliament[6].\n\n5.6             \nThis would be separate from the consent mechanism discussed in\nparagraph 14 of the Memorandum of Understanding.  In\nparticular, this would be an opportunity to influence, not a\nrequirement for consent.\n\n5.7             \nIt would be possible, although not essential, for the new\narrangements to be partly accommodated within the arrangements for\nthe Welsh Grand Committee in the House of Commons[7].\n\n5.8             \nIt would also be possible, although again not essential, for the\narrangements to be established as an addition to the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding.\n\n5.9             \nThe proposed arrangements would have some similarities with the\narrangements according to which Bills are scrutinised by the House\nof Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory\nReform.  In particular, that Committee receives a memorandum\nfrom the Minister in Charge of each Bill and makes a report to the\nHouse, generally before the Committee Stage[8]. \nThe Committee also makes supplementary reports relating to\nsignificant amendments where time allows.\n\n5.10           \nThe proposed arrangements would not require legislation[9]. \nThey would involve a new process within Government Departments that\ncould be instigated entirely informally.  The Parliamentary\nside of the arrangements might be achieved through changes to the\nStanding Orders; but it could probably also be achieved entirely\ninformally.\n\n6                 \nconclusion\n\n6.1             \nArrangements along the lines adumbrated in section 5 could be\nestablished quickly and with little or no formality.\n\n6.2             \nThe aim of the arrangements would be to ensure that the National\nAssembly always had an opportunity to influence proposals to confer\nfunctions on Welsh Ministers.\n\n6.3             \nThis would include, but would not be limited to, an opportunity to\nexpress a view as to whether each proposal to confer powers\ndirectly was appropriate, or could better be achieved by\nlegislation of the National Assembly.\n\n \n\n\nDANIEL GREENBERG\n\n\n31st August 2011\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]\nParliamentary Counsel (UK) 1991-2010; Parliamentary Counsel, Berwin\nLeighton Paisner LLP, 2010->; Editor, Craies on\nLegislation, 2004, 2008, (2012); Editor, Stroud?s\nJudicial Dictionary, 2000, 2006, (2012); General Editor,\nJowitt?s Dictionary of English Law, 2010; General\nEditor, Annotated Statutes, Westlaw UK, 2008->. \nThis submission represents my personal views and not the views of\nBLP or any other organisation.\n\n\n\n\n[2]\nAs a matter of convention in accordance with the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding - but not as a matter of law or Parliamentary\nprocedure.\n\n\n\n\n[3]\nParagraph 14.\n\n\n\n\n[4]\nPrepared in August 2011 by the National Assembly for Wales?\nResearch Service for the Constitutional and Legal Affairs\nCommittee?s inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n[5]\nIn a case where the powers had been requested by the Welsh\nGovernment, the UK Government?s memorandum could either adopt\nor attach a memorandum produced by Welsh Ministers.\n\n\n\n\n[6]\nAs a result of which it would become a public document, and could\nbe included in the documents relating to the Bill made available on\nParliament?s website.\n\n\n\n\n[7]\nHouse of Commons Standing Orders, SO 102-108.\n\n\n\n\n[8]\nThe Companion to the Standing Orders in the House of Lords says\n(para.7.33): ?The committee aims to report before the\ncommittee stage begins, though the House is under no obligation to\ndelay proceedings if the committee has not reported by that\ntime.?\n\n\n\n\n[9]\nIn particular, the use of the Command Paper procedure allows\ndocuments to be laid before Parliament without any legislative\nrequirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Two hymns brought to a close our formal seminar series for this academic year. \n\nJames opens with a fantastic introduction, as we learn about these astonishing sources, and how they became held in the BFI. All the small anecdotes are included alongside the bigger picture. Then to the films. (It's not the same, but click on the links to watch on screen online (on campus only, I think). \n\nFirstly, Every Valley. I was moved by this remarkable film, and I'm still not sure why. Of course Handel always has that effect, but even so. Truly beautiful. A clich��, but what wonderful poetry.  Edgar Anstey, one of the great documentary makers, shows Wales at work. The buses and trains deliver people between work and home. Never has progress marched to such a wonderful tune. 'Messiah', no less. Yet pathos too: this is not the kind of celebration we could have now. We couldn't make the film, and we wouldn't give it the credence. There's no believable sense of progress as there was then. \n\nThen my birthday treat: Elizabethan Express. It's festival time, summer 1954, and we follow the progress of the express service, non-stopping, from King's Cross to Waverley. Set to verse, it looks at the nuts, bolts, seats, timetables, track, train, and restaurant carriages. With the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a boar, the This isn't the hard shock of Every Valley ? it's the froth on the cappuccino to the intense espresso of Every Valley, but no less hymnal. This is a celebration, to my mind, of these skills and crafts which so many working people had. More fool the wealthy passengers on this holiday special, if they can't see what a beautiful piece of art their journey was. \n\nIt comes to an end, and people struggle to find the words, somehow. The pictures and music and words were wonderful. Thanks so much James. \n\nAnd so our journey too is nearly at an end. There are still a few spaces for Peterborough ? I suggest you turn up at the Demontfort Hall entrance onto Victoria Park at 8:45 tomorrow if you haven't booked. Dropping me a line is a good idea. All that steam and coal and metal and light. See you tomorrow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMalcolm\n\n\nat\n12:03\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nFriday, 19 March 2010\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nElkes Memorial Lecture: 22/3/2010\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou are warmly invited to the seventeenth Elchanan & Miriam Elkes Memorial Lecture. William Parsons (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC) is going to give it on Remembering the Past for the Sake of the Future. Starting at 6.00 pm on Monday, 22 March 2010, in the Rattray Lecture Theatre, and there's a reception at 7:00pm in the Charles Wilson Building. The talk will focus on how perpetrators seem to learn from history that the world always has \"reasons\" for not preventing genocide and mass atrocities. Although we build effective memorials and we are seldom capable of prevention, individuals, groups, and nations can push back on mass hate and violence.\n\nA little more on the speaker: before becoming Chief of Staff, he served as the Museum's Director of Education and was responsible for developing educational programs both in Washington and throughout the nation. For the past thirty years, he has been involved in writing, speaking, and creating programs that advance public awareness and knowledge about the Holocaust and genocide and the implications of this history for the world we live in today. In 2002, he received the Distinguished Achievement Award from Cornell College for his career work in Holocaust and genocide education.\n\nHis published works include: Facing History and Ourselves: Holocaust and Human Behavior ( 1982); The Middle Passage (1986); A World of Difference: Teacher/Student Study Guide (1987); The African Meeting House: A Sourcebook (co-author, 1988); Everyone's Not Here: Families of the Armenian Genocide, A Study Guide (1989); and Century of Genocide: Eyewitness Accounts and Critical Views (co-editor, revised for 2004 publication under a new title: Century of Genocide: Essays and Eyewitness Accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMalcolm\n\n\nat\n23:50\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink words:\nEvents,\nHolocaust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nMonday, 15 March 2010\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nIn our lab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell I hope you enjoyed Friday. What an occasion! Some thanks need to be given, first of all. To the wonderful music provided by Pete Allen, to the various bakers, the ticket inspectors, and many others. And of course to Lord Bragg for entertaining and informing us in his customary style. We'll have the Labcast up as soon as possible. In the meantime, why not read this piece from the Mercury\n    about the event? It was on page two of Saturday's print edition.  \n\nWho could follow Mel B? I hear you ask. Only James Patterson, is the answer. This Friday, 19th March at 4:30pm (refreshments) for a 5:00pm start, a film screening of some treats from the British Transport Film Unit. Looking at utility, at their history and accession (James was responsible for this when he was a curator at the BFI), and enjoying them too! Popcorn and soda provided in this warm up to...\n\nSunday, 21st March. Take a bus to Peterborough, and then ride around on steam trains, with tea and cake, and the opportunity to get off and have a meander around Peterborough, go for lunch and view it's beautiful Cathedral. Steam and Gothic. What more do you want? Doing history with your hands. History what you can smell, what you can touch. To book your place on this, please give �10 to Lucy Byrne (lb77@le.ac.uk) sharpish ? spaces are filling rapidly.

Lord Bragg is a veteran broadcaster, whose programming is of the highest intellectual standard, and draws huge audiences. The South Bank Show is perhaps the nation's best-loved cultural programme, and In Our Time is listened to by one in thirty of the UK's adult population. \n\nMelvyn is also an accomplished historian, who has worked extensively on the history of the English, with The Routes of English and Adventures of English. And if all that weren't enough, he is also a respected novelist, with previous works including The Maid of Buttermere, Autumn Manoeuvres, and most recently Remember Me. \n\nAs you'd expect from the Lab, the format is both familiar and a departure from the norm at the same time. Melvyn has interviewed a host of people: from prominent academics to Coldplay and other popular entertainers. To turn this on its head, he will be subjected to extensive grilling and discussion with Rob, before the whole thing is opened up to the floor. So get your questions historical in order for this extraordinary and exceptional opportunity. We are planning to record the session as a Labcast, so if you ask a question or contribute to the discussion, your voice will be included in this. \n\nI always say it: but I think this really may be the best lab yet! \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This session will run a little earlier to accommodate Melvyn's other commitments. We will start tea and cake at 15:45, and the talk will begin at 16:45. We will be in the pub roughly one hour after this, unless we get carried away. \n\nNote: Admission is strictly by ticket only. All are presently allocated, but you may email Lucy Byrne (lb77@le.ac.uk) to be placed on a waiting list. If you have one, and can't come, please return your ticket to Lucy so that it can be reissued. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMalcolm\n\n\nat\n12:00\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink words:\nLabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n          \n\n          \n        \nWednesday, 10 March 2010\n\n\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\nIt?s a sell-out lecture!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday's lecture is now full!

Peter said that no Remploy factory would close without proper scrutiny by Ministers. He also promised to see how procurement opportunities in government could be opened up for Remploy factories.\n\nThe Labour-led Assembly government is already encouraging public bodies to use Remploy factories, and the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust, for example, will be working with the Remploy factory in Dinas. The Dinas factory is of course staying open ? it operates in the field of recycling computers ? removing confidential data to the highest standards ? and in the recycling of white goods. These are both good businesses to be in for the long-term, given the new laws on recycling of computers and white goods.

The print shows the hustings set up in front of St Paul's church, Covent Garden in 1796. Westminster elections, with their very large electorate of around 12,000, were notorious for their potential for radicalism and violent disturbance: however, after a run of very fierce contests in the 1780s costing both sides a huge amount of money, the government and opposition came to an agreement in the 1790 election to divide the two seats between them.  In the 1796 election, however, the agreement came close to breaking down.  The main candidates were, for the opposition, the leader of the Whig party, Charles James Fox. He is shown on the platform, in the centre of the picture with his arm around a post. For the government, Sir Alan Gardner, an admiral. He is shown in uniform, with his arms folded. The radical reformer, John Horne Tooke is stood between Fox and Gardner, holding his hat. Tooke had been tried and acquitted on a charge of high treason in 1794 connected to his contacts with French revolutionaries. He mounted a challenge to Gardner, and gathered 2,819 votes, against Gardner's 4,814 and Fox's 5,160. Tooke eventually found a seat in the Commons in 1801, although due to ill health, he did not return to the House after the dissolution of 1802.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Copyright: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Full copyright information\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n        \n\t    \n\t        \n\t    \n        \n    \n\t\t\t\t\n    \n\n\t    \n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t        \n\t\t        \n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Footer links\n\n\t\n        \tA-Z index\n\tGlossary\n\tContact us\n\tFreedom of Information\n\tJobs\n\tUsing this website\n\tCopyright\n\tCookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n        \n    ",

If you are new here, you might want to subscribe to the RSS feed for updates on this topic.\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\nMany thanks to VB reader General Synposis for this interesting contribution â Ed.\n\nWith the weather being like it has for what seems like months, one silver lining is supposed to be the Â£25-a-week cold weather payments the government makes to the elderly and people on certain benefits. The payments, not to be confused with the lump-sum winter fuel allowance, are triggered when the average temperature falls below freezing for seven consecutive days.\n\nSo whatâs happened to them this winter in our part of the Island?\n\nSouth, Central & West wasnât cold?\n\nThe Directgov website  has a very useful page where you enter your postcode and it tells you how many of these payments are supposed to have been made since November 1. But enter any poscode for PO38 (Ventnor, Niton, Whitwell, Godshill etc) and the message comes up: âThe Met Office have notified the Department for Work and Pensions that no periods of very cold weather have occurred in the PO38 postcode area between 1 November 2010 and 22 December 2010 that would trigger a Cold Weather Payment. No Cold Weather Payments are due to be made.â The same thing happens for PO30 (Newport and surrounding areas), and PO39, 40 and 41 (the West Wight).\n\nâ¦ but Sandown, Shanklin and the North was?\n\nNow the really puzzling bit. Sandown and Shanklinâs postcode is PO36. Enter that on the website and this is what you get: âThe Met Office have notified the Department for Work and Pensions that 3 periods of very cold weather have occurred in the PO36 postcode area between 1 November 2010 and 22 December 2010, triggering Cold Weather Payments. If you have qualified for Cold Weather Payments since 1 November 2010 and live in this postcode area, you are due to receive 3 Cold Weather Payments.â \n\nThe rest of the Island (PO31 to PO37) gets the same result. Â£75 a head so far then for the winners in this postcode lottery, not a fortune but worth having all the same.\n\nSo whatâs the explanation?\n\nHave the men from the ministry been out in your street with their thermometers? Have they found the Ventnor Riviera basking in its usual year-round balminess? We think not.\n\nThe fact is that we owe this particular financial misfortune to St Catherineâs Lighthouse. In the lighthouse grounds is a Met Office weather station, and itâs from this stationâs readings that the DWP allocate, or in this case withhold, cold weather payments. The north and east of the Island are, for reasons not entirely clear, covered by the weather station on Thorney Island, just across from Portsmouth.\n\nThe case against using St Catherineâs \n\nNow, before anyone (especially some DWP jobsworth looking for ways to save money) suggests that the whole Island be covered from the lighthouse, letâs consider whether this would be scientifically sound.\n\nSt Catherineâs is in a very exposed, south-facing, coastal position. Itâs a very good place for a lighthouse but not such a clever place for measuring temperatures which are then used as typical for the neighbouring towns and villages. \n\nSea is warmer than land in Winter\n\nItâs surrounded by the sea on three sides, and in cold winter weather the sea is always warmer than the land. That warmth influences the land temperature on a very narrow coastal strip, but as soon as you get even half a mile inland, that influence decreases. \n\nEven in Niton village, winter temperatures are regularly a full degree Centigrade lower than those at St Catherineâs â easily enough to make the difference between seven days of frost and six. In Newport the difference can be several degrees. \n\nIn short, St Catherineâs is highly likely to be the warmest place on the entire island, with the possible exception of locations right on the beach on the south coast. Thorney Island would give a truer reflection for nearly all of us.\n\nTime for a rethink?\n\nThe DWP and Met Office will, weâre sure, say they canât have weather stations in every village. True enough. But shouldnât they make sure that the ones they do use are fit for purpose?\n\nImage: radioedit under CC BY 2.0\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t6 readers' comments to the âSouth Wight Shortchanged On Cold Weather Payments?â story\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t Dawn watson says:\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t29, December 2010 at 1:00 pm\t\t\n\n\n\t\tI think itâs disgusting that we wasnât paid this as my house isnât the warmest and I have three little children living with me and pregnant with my fourth.

The temperature variation from the coast to inland is huge, it can be -5C inland and still not freezing on the coast.

These are called dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and giant cell fibroblastoma (GCF).\n\n\nDoctors usually remove DFSP and GCF with surgery. But sometimes they are not able to remove the whole area of sarcoma, or the cancer may start to grow again after the operation. These sarcomas can sometimes spread to another part of the body, although this is rare. If cancer continues to grow or spreads to another area of the body, it is often more difficult to treat.\n\n\nImatinib (Glivec) is a type of treatment called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This means it blocks enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which are part of the system that tells the cell to grow. If TKs could be stopped from working in cancer cells, then the cells should stop growing and dividing.\n\n\nThe research team hoped that imatinib would work on cells that contain a specific protein. This protein, called COL1A1/PGDF, is found in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and giant cell fibroblastoma cells.\n\n\nImatinib has been shown to work well for some other cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma (GIST) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). But the researchers were not sure how well it would work for these rare types of sarcoma of the skin.\n\n\nThe aims of this trial were to find out\n\n\n\tHow well imatinib worked for DFSP and GCF\n\tMore about the side effects\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRecruitment\n\n\t\t\tStart 27/04/2004\n\n\t\t\tEnd 01/04/2007\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPhase\n\n\t\t\tPhase 2\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSummary of results\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen the trial closed, it had recruited only people with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). The trial team found that DFPS responded well to imatinib.\n\n\nThis trial recruited 16 people. Everyone had imatinib.\n\n\nAfter 14 weeks treatment, the researchers were able to assess how the cancer had responded in 14 of the 16 people. Of these people their cancer had\n\n\n\tShrunk in 5\n\tStayed the same in 6\n\tContinued to grow in 3\n\n\n\nThe average amount of time it took for the DFSP to start growing again was over 1 and a half years.\n\n\nThe most common side effects were\n\n\n\tA drop in blood cells\n\tTiredness\n\tDiarrhoea\n\tFeeling or being sick\n\n\n\nThe trial team concluded that imatinib worked well for people with DFSP.\n\n\nWe have based this summary on information from the team who ran the trial.
