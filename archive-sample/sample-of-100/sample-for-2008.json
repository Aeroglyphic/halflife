          "Darlleniadau’r Sul - Pentecost 4 (A) : Eglwys y Santes Fair\n\n\n\n\n\tEglwys y Santes Fair\n\n\tCynulleidfa Gymraeg Plwyf Aberystwyth\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tDarlleniadau’r Sul - Pentecost 4 (A)\n\n\tHosea 5.15–6.6\n\nDychwelaf drachefn i’m lle, nes iddynt weld eu bai, a chwilio amdanaf, a’m ceisio yn eu hadfyd. Dewch, dychwelwn drachefn at yr ARGLWYDD; fe’n drylliodd, ac fe’n hiachâ; fe’n trawodd, ac fe’n meddyginiaetha. Fe’n hadfywia ar ôl deuddydd, a’n codi ar y trydydd dydd, inni fyw yn ei ŵydd. Gadewch inni adnabod, ymdrechu i adnabod, yr ARGLWYDD; y mae ei ddyfodiad mor sicr â’r wawr; daw fel glaw atom, fel glaw gwanwyn sy’n dyfrhau’r ddaear. Beth a wnaf i ti, Effraim? Beth a wnaf i ti, Jwda? Y mae dy ffyddlondeb fel tarth y bore, fel gwlith sy’n codi’n gynnar. Am hynny, fe’u drylliais trwy’r proffwydi, fe’u lleddais â geiriau fy ngenau, a daw fy marn allan fel goleuni. Oherwydd ffyddlondeb a geisiaf, ac nid aberth, gwybodaeth o Dduw yn hytrach na phoethoffrymau.\n\nRhufeiniaid 4.13-25\n\nY mae’r addewid i Abraham, neu i’w ddisgynyddion, y byddai yn etifedd y byd, wedi ei rhoi, nid trwy’r Gyfraith ond trwy’r cyfiawnder a geir trwy ffydd. Oherwydd, os y rhai sy’n byw yn ôl y Gyfraith yw’r etifeddion, yna gwagedd yw ffydd, a diddim yw’r addewid. Digofaint yw cynnyrch y Gyfraith, ond lle nad oes cyfraith, nid oes trosedd yn ei herbyn chwaith. Am hynny, rhoddwyd yr addewid trwy ffydd er mwyn iddi fod yn ôl gras, fel y byddai yn ddilys i bawb o ddisgynyddion Abraham, nid yn unig i’r rhai sy’n byw yn ôl y Gyfraith, ond hefyd i’r rhai sy’n byw yn ôl ffydd Abraham. Y mae Abraham yn dad i ni i gyd; fel y mae’n ysgrifenedig: “Yr wyf yn dy benodi yn dad cenhedloedd lawer.” Yn y Duw a ddywedodd hyn y credodd Abraham, y Duw sy’n gwneud y meirw’n fyw, ac yn galw i fod yr hyn nad yw’n bod. A’r credu hwn, â gobaith y tu hwnt i obaith, a’i gwnaeth yn dad cenhedloedd lawer, yn ôl yr hyn a lefarwyd: “Felly y bydd dy ddisgynyddion.” Er ei fod tua chant oed, ni wanychodd yn ei ffydd, wrth ystyried cyflwr marw ei gorff ei hun a marweidd-dra croth Sara. Nid amheuodd ddim ynglŷn ag addewid Duw, na diffygio mewn ffydd, ond yn hytrach grymusodd yn ei ffydd a rhoi gogoniant i Dduw, yn llawn hyder fod Duw yn abl i gyflawni’r hyn yr oedd wedi ei addo. Dyma pam y cyfrifwyd ei ffydd iddo yn gyfiawnder. Ond ysgrifennwyd y geiriau, “fe’i cyfrifwyd iddo”, nid ar gyfer Abraham yn unig, ond ar ein cyfer ni hefyd. Y mae cyfiawnder i’w gyfrif i ni, sydd â ffydd gennym yn yr hwn a gyfododd Iesu ein Harglwydd oddi wrth y meirw. Cafodd ef ei draddodi i farwolaeth am ein camweddau, a’i gyfodi i’n cyfiawnhau ni.\n\nSalm 50.7-15\n\n‘Gwrandewch, O fy mhobl, a llefaraf:\n\nmyfi yw Duw, dy Dduw di,\n\n\tac fe ddygaf dystiolaeth yn dy erbyn, O Israel.\n\n‘Ni cheryddaf di am dy aberthau:\n\noherwydd y mae dy offrymau’n wastad ger fy mron.\n\n‘Ni chymeraf fustach o’th dŷ:\n\nna bychod geifr o’th gorlannau.\n\n‘Oherwydd eiddof fi holl fwystfilod y goedwig:\n\na’r gwartheg ar fil o fryniau.\n\n‘Yr wyf yn adnabod holl adar yr awyr:\n\nac eiddof fi holl ymlusgiaid y maes.\n\n‘Pe bawn yn newynu, ni ddywedwn wrthyt ti:\n\noherwydd eiddof fi’r byd a’r hyn sydd ynddo.\n\n‘A fwytâf gig eich teirw:\n\nneu yfed gwaed eich bychod?\n\n‘Rhowch i Dduw offrymau diolchgarwch:\n\na thalwch eich addunedau i’r Goruchaf.\n\n‘Os gelwi arnaf yn nydd cyfyngder:\n\nfe’th waredaf a byddi yn fy anrhydeddu.’\n\nMathew 9.9-13, 18-26\n\nWrth fynd heibio oddi yno gwelodd Iesu ddyn a elwid Mathew yn eistedd wrth y dollfa, a dywedodd wrtho, “Canlyn fi.” Cododd yntau a chanlynodd ef. Ac yr oedd wrth bryd bwyd yn ei dŷ, a dyma lawer o gasglwyr trethi ac o bechaduriaid yn dod a chydfwyta gyda Iesu a’i ddisgyblion. A phan welodd y Phariseaid, dywedasant wrth ei ddisgyblion, “Pam y mae eich athro yn bwyta gyda chasglwyr trethi a phechaduriaid?” Clywodd Iesu, a dywedodd, “Nid ar y cryfion ond ar y cleifion y mae angen meddyg. Ond ewch a dysgwch beth yw ystyr hyn, ‘Trugaredd a ddymunaf, nid aberth’. Oherwydd i alw pechaduriaid, nid rhai cyfiawn, yr wyf fi wedi dod.”\n\nTra oedd ef yn siarad fel hyn â hwy, dyma ryw lywodraethwr yn dod ato ac ymgrymu iddo a dweud, “Y mae fy merch newydd farw; ond tyrd a rho dy law arni, ac fe fydd fyw.” A chododd Iesu a dilynodd ef gyda’i ddisgyblion. A dyma wraig ac arni waedlif ers deuddeng mlynedd yn dod ato o’r tu ôl ac yn cyffwrdd ag ymyl ei fantell. Oherwydd yr oedd hi wedi dweud ynddi ei hun, “Dim ond imi gyffwrdd â’i fantell, fe gaf fy iacháu.” A throes Iesu, a gwelodd hi, ac meddai, “Cod dy galon, fy merch; y mae dy ffydd wedi dy iacháu di.” Ac iachawyd y wraig o’r munud hwnnw. Pan ddaeth Iesu i dŷ’r llywodraethwr, a gweld y pibyddion a’r dyrfa mewn cynnwrf, dywedodd, “Ewch ymaith, oherwydd nid yw’r eneth wedi marw; cysgu y mae.” Dechreusant chwerthin am ei ben. Ac wedi i’r dyrfa gael ei gyrru allan, aeth ef i mewn a gafael yn ei llaw, a chododd yr eneth. Ac aeth yr hanes am hyn allan i’r holl ardal honno.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDarlleniadau’r Sul - Pentecost 2 (A)\n\n\tLefiticus 19.1-2, 9-18\n\nLlefarodd yr ARGLWYDD wrth Moses, “Dywed wrth holl gynulleidfa pobl Israel, ‘Byddwch sanctaidd, oherwydd yr wyf fi, yr ARGLWYDD eich Duw, yn sanctaidd.\n\n“‘Pan fyddi’n medi cynhaeaf dy dir, nid wyt i fedi at ymylon y maes na chasglu lloffion dy gynhaeaf. Nid wyt i ddinoethi dy winllan yn llwyr na chasglu’r grawnwin a syrthiodd; gad hwy i’r tlawd a’r estron. Myfi yw’r ARGLWYDD dy Dduw. Nid ydych i ladrata, na dweud celwydd, na thwyllo eich gilydd. Nid ydych i dyngu’n dwyllodrus yn fy enw, a halogi enw eich Duw. Myfi yw’r ARGLWYDD. Nid wyt i wneud cam â’th gymydog na dwyn oddi arno. Nid wyt i ddal yn ôl hyd y bore gyflog dy weithiwr. Nid wyt i felltithio’r byddar na rhoi rhwystr ar ffordd y dall; ond ofna dy Dduw. Myfi yw’r ARGLWYDD. Nid wyt i wyro barn, na bod yn bleidiol tuag at y tlawd na dangos ffafriaeth at y mawr, ond yr wyt i farnu dy gymydog yn deg. Nid wyt i fynd o amgylch yn enllibio ymysg dy bobl na pheryglu bywyd dy gymydog. Myfi yw’r ARGLWYDD. Nid wyt i gasáu dy frawd a’th chwaer yn dy galon, ond yr wyt i geryddu dy gymydog rhag iti fod yn gyfrifol am ei drosedd. Nid wyt i geisio dial ar un o’th bobl, na dal dig tuag ato, ond yr wyt i garu dy gymydog fel ti dy hun. Myfi yw’r ARGLWYDD.’”\n\nSalm 119.33-40\n\nO Arglwydd, dysg fi yn ffordd dy ddeddfau:\n\nac o’i chadw fe gaf wobr.\n\nRho imi ddeall, er mwyn imi ufuddhau i’th gyfraith:\n\na’i chadw â’m holl galon.\n\nGwna imi gerdded yn llwybr dy orchmynion:\n\noherwydd yr wyf yn ymhyfrydu ynddo.\n\nTro fy nghalon at dy farnedigaethau:\n\nyn hytrach nag at elw.\n\nTro ymaith fy llygaid rhag gweled gwagedd:\n\nadfywia fi â’th air.\n\nCyflawna i’th was yr addewid:\n\na roddaist i’r rhai sy’n dy ofni.\n\nTro ymaith y gwaradwydd yr wyf yn ei ofni:\n\noherwydd y mae dy farnau’n dda.\n\nYr wyf yn dyheu am dy ofynion:\n\nadfywia fi â’th gyfiawnder.\n\n1 Corinthiaid 3.10-11, 16-23\n\nYn ôl y gorchwyl a roddodd Duw i mi o’i ras, mi osodais sylfaen, fel prifadeiladydd celfydd, ac y mae rhywun arall yn adeiladu arni. Gwylied pob un pa fodd y mae’n adeiladu arni. Ni all neb osod sylfaen arall yn lle’r un sydd wedi ei gosod, ac Iesu Grist yw honno.\n\nOni wyddoch mai teml Duw ydych, a bod Ysbryd Duw yn trigo ynoch? Os bydd rhywun yn dinistrio teml Duw, bydd Duw’n ei ddinistrio yntau, oherwydd y mae teml Duw yn sanctaidd, a chwi yw’r deml honno. Peidied neb â’i dwyllo’i hunan; os oes rhywun yn eich plith yn tybio ei fod yn ddoeth yn ôl safonau’r oes hon, bydded ffôl, er mwyn dod yn ddoeth. Oherwydd y mae doethineb y byd hwn yn ffolineb yng ngolwg Duw. Y mae’n ysgrifenedig: “Y mae ef yn dal y doethion yn eu cyfrwystra”, ac eto: “Y mae’r Arglwydd yn gwybod meddyliau’r doethion, mai ofer ydynt.” Felly peidied neb ag ymffrostio mewn arweinwyr dynol. Oherwydd y mae pob peth yn eiddo i chwi — Paul, Apolos, Ceffas, y byd, bywyd, angau, y presennol, y dyfodol — pob peth yn eiddo i chwi, a chwithau yn eiddo Crist, a Christ yn eiddo Duw.\n\nMathew 5.38-48\n\nDywedodd Iesu, “Clywsoch fel y dywedwyd, ‘Llygad am lygad, a dant am ddant.’ Ond ‘rwyf fi’n dweud wrthych: peidiwch â gwrthsefyll y sawl sy’n gwneud drwg i chwi. Os bydd rhywun yn dy daro ar dy foch dde, tro’r llall ato hefyd. Ac os bydd rhywun am fynd â thi i gyfraith a chymryd dy grys, gad iddo gael dy fantell hefyd. Ac os bydd rhywun yn dy orfodi i’w ddanfon am un cilomedr, dos gydag ef ddwy. Rho i’r sawl sy’n gofyn gennyt, a phaid â throi i ffwrdd oddi wrth y sawl sydd am fenthyca gennyt. Clywsoch fel y dywedwyd, ‘Câr dy gymydog, a chasâ dy elyn.’ Ond ‘rwyf fi’n dweud wrthych: carwch eich gelynion, a gweddïwch dros y rhai sy’n eich erlid; felly fe fyddwch yn blant i’ch Tad sydd yn y nefoedd, oherwydd y mae ef yn peri i’w haul godi ar y drwg a’r da, ac yn rhoi glaw i’r cyfiawn a’r anghyfiawn. Os carwch y rhai sy’n eich caru chwi, pa wobr sydd i chwi? Onid yw hyd yn oed y casglwyr trethi yn gwneud cymaint â hynny? Ac os cyfarchwch eich cydnabod yn unig, pa ragoriaeth sydd yn hynny? Onid yw’r Cenhedloedd hyd yn oed yn gwneud cymaint â hynny? Felly byddwch chwi’n berffaith fel y mae eich Tad nefol yn berffaith.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDarlleniadau’r Sul - Pentecost (A)\n\n\tActau 2.1-21\n\nAr ddydd cyflawni cyfnod y Pentecost yr oeddent oll ynghyd yn yr un lle, ac yn sydyn fe ddaeth o’r nef s?n fel gwynt grymus yn rhuthro, ac fe lanwodd yr holl dŷ lle’r oeddent yn eistedd. Ymddangosodd iddynt dafodau fel o dân yn ymrannu ac yn eistedd un ar bob un ohonynt; a llanwyd hwy oll â’r Ysbryd Glân, a dechreusant lefaru â thafodau dieithr, fel yr oedd yr Ysbryd yn rhoi lleferydd iddynt. Yr oedd yn preswylio yn Jerwsalem Iddewon, pobl dduwiol o bob cenedl dan y nef; ac wrth glywed y sŵn hwn fe ymgasglodd tyrfa ohonynt, ac yr oeddent wedi drysu’n lân am fod pob un ohonynt yn eu clywed hwy yn siarad yn ei iaith ei hun. Yr oeddent yn synnu a rhyfeddu, ac meddent, “Onid Galileaid yw’r rhain oll sy’n llefaru? A sut yr ydym ni yn eu clywed bob un ohonom yn ei iaith ei hun, iaith ei fam? Parthiaid a Mediaid ac Elamitiaid, a thrigolion Mesopotamia, Jwdea a Capadocia, Pontus ac Asia, Phrygia a Pamffylia, yr Aifft a pharthau Libya tua Cyrene, a’r ymwelwyr o Rufain, yn Iddewon a phroselytiaid, Cretiaid ac Arabiaid, yr ydym yn eu clywed hwy yn llefaru yn ein hieithoedd ni am fawrion weithredoedd Duw.” Yr oedd pawb yn synnu mewn penbleth, gan ddweud y naill wrth y llall, “Beth yw ystyr hyn?” Ond yr oedd eraill yn dweud yn wawdlyd, “Wedi meddwi y maent.” Safodd Pedr ynghyd â’r un ar ddeg, a chododd ei lais a’u hannerch: “Chwi Iddewon, a thrigolion Jerwsalem oll, bydded hyn yn hysbys i chwi; gwrandewch ar fy ngeiriau. Nid yw’r rhain wedi meddwi, fel yr ydych chwi’n tybio, oherwydd dim ond naw o’r gloch y bore yw hi. Eithr dyma’r hyn a ddywedwyd drwy’r proffwyd Joel: ‘A hyn a fydd yn y dyddiau olaf, medd Duw: tywalltaf o’m Hysbryd ar bawb; a bydd eich meibion a’ch merched yn proffwydo; bydd eich gwŷr ifainc yn cael gweledigaethau, a’ch hynafgwyr yn gweld breuddwydion; hyd yn oed ar fy nghaethweision a’m caethforynion, yn y dyddiau hynny, fe dywalltaf o’m Hysbryd, ac fe broffwydant. A rhof ryfeddodau yn y nef uchod ac arwyddion ar y ddaear isod, gwaed a thân a tharth mwg; troir yr haul yn dywyllwch, a’r lleuad yn waed, cyn i ddydd mawr a disglair yr Arglwydd ddod; a bydd pob un sy’n galw ar enw’r Arglwydd yn cael ei achub.’\n\nSalm 104.24-34,35b\n\nMor niferus yw dy weithredoedd, O Arglwydd!:\n\ngwnaethost y cyfan mewn doethineb\n\nac y mae’r ddaear yn llawn o’th greaduriaid.\n\nDyma’r môr mawr a llydan:\n\ngydag ymlusgiaid dirifedi\n\na chreaduriaid bach a mawr.\n\nArno y mae’r llongau yn tramwyo:\n\na Lefiathan a greaist er difyrrwch.\n\nY mae’r cyfan ohonynt yn dibynnu arnat ti:\n\ni roi iddynt eu bwyd yn ei bryd.\n\nPan roddi iddynt y maent yn ei gasglu ynghyd:\n\npan agori dy law cânt eu diwallu’n llwyr.\n\nOnd pan guddi dy wyneb fe’u drysir:\n\npan gymeri eu hanadl\n\nfe ddarfyddant a dychwelyd i’r llwch.\n\nPan anfoni dy Ysbryd cânt eu hadfywio:\n\nac yr wyt yn adnewyddu wyneb y ddaear.\n\nBydded gogoniant yr Arglwydd dros byth:\n\na bydded iddo lawenhau yn ei weithredoedd.\n\nPan yw’n edrych ar y ddaear y mae’n crynu:\n\npan yw’n cyffwrdd â’r mynyddoedd y maent yn mygu.\n\nCanaf i’r Arglwydd tra byddaf byw:\n\nrhof foliant i Dduw tra byddaf.\n\nBydded fy myfyrdod yn gymeradwy ganddo:\n\nyr wyf yn llawenhau yn yr Arglwydd.\n\nFy enaid, bendithia’r Arglwydd,\n\nmolwch yr Arglwydd.\n\n1 Corinthiaid 3b-13\n\nNi all neb ddweud, “Iesu yw’r Arglwydd!” ond trwy yr Ysbryd Glân. Y mae amrywiaeth doniau, ond yr un Ysbryd sy’n eu rhoi; ac y mae amrywiaeth gweinidogaethau, ond yr un Arglwydd sy’n eu rhoi; ac y mae amrywiaeth gweithrediadau, ond yr un Duw sydd yn gweithredu pob peth ym mhawb. Rhoddir amlygiad o’r Ysbryd i bob un, er lles pawb. Oherwydd fe roddir i un, trwy’r Ysbryd, lefaru doethineb; i un arall, lefaru gwybodaeth, yn ôl yr un Ysbryd; i un arall rhoddir ffydd, trwy’r un Ysbryd; i un arall ddoniau iacháu, trwy’r un Ysbryd; i un arall gyflawni gwyrthiau, i un arall broffwydo, i un arall wahaniaethu rhwng ysbrydoedd, i un arall lefaru â thafodau, i un arall ddehongli tafodau. A’r holl bethau hyn, yr un a’r unrhyw Ysbryd sydd yn eu gweithredu, gan rannu, yn ôl ei ewyllys, i bob un ar wahân. Oherwydd fel y mae’r corff yn un, a chanddo lawer o aelodau, a’r rheini oll, er eu bod yn llawer, yn un corff, fel hyn y mae Crist hefyd. Oherwydd mewn un Ysbryd y cawsom i gyd ein bedyddio i un corff, boed yn Iddewon neu yn Roegiaid, yn gaethweision neu yn rhyddion, a rhoddwyd i bawb ohonom un Ysbryd i’w yfed.\n\nIoan 20.19-23\n\nGyda’r nos ar y dydd cyntaf hwnnw o’r wythnos, yr oedd y drysau wedi eu cloi lle’r oedd y disgyblion, oherwydd eu bod yn ofni’r Iddewon. A dyma Iesu’n dod ac yn sefyll yn eu canol, ac yn dweud wrthynt, “Tangnefedd i chwi!” Wedi dweud hyn, dangosodd ei ddwylo a’i ystlys iddynt. Pan welsant yr Arglwydd, llawenychodd y disgyblion. Meddai Iesu wrthynt eilwaith, “Tangnefedd i chwi! Fel y mae’r Tad wedi fy anfon i, yr wyf fi hefyd yn eich anfon chwi.” Ac wedi dweud hyn, anadlodd arnynt a dweud: “Derbyniwch yr Ysbryd Glân.

Ond fe dderbyniwch nerth wedi i’r Ysbryd Glân ddod arnoch, a byddwch yn dystion i mi yn Jerwsalem, ac yn holl Jwdea a Samaria, a hyd eithaf y ddaear.” Wedi iddo ddweud hyn, a hwythau’n edrych, fe’i dyrchafwyd, a chipiodd cwmwl ef o’u golwg. Fel yr oeddent yn syllu tua’r nef, ac yntau’n mynd, dyma ddau ŵr yn sefyll yn eu hymyl mewn dillad gwyn, ac meddai’r rhain, “Wŷr Galilea, pam yr ydych yn sefyll yn edrych tua’r nef? Yr Iesu hwn, sydd wedi ei gymryd i fyny oddi wrthych i’r nef, bydd yn dod yn yr un modd ag y gwelsoch ef yn mynd i’r nef.” Yna dychwelsant i Jerwsalem o’r mynydd a elwir Olewydd, sydd yn agos i Jerwsalem, daith Saboth oddi yno.

Oherwydd wrth fynd o gwmpas ac edrych ar eich pethau cysegredig, cefais yn eu plith allor ac arni’n ysgrifenedig, ‘I Dduw nid adwaenir’. Yr hyn, ynteu, yr ydych chwi’n ei addoli heb ei adnabod, dyna’r hyn yr wyf fi’n ei gyhoeddi i chwi. Y Duw a wnaeth y byd a phopeth sydd ynddo, nid yw ef, ac yntau’n Arglwydd nef a daear, yn preswylio mewn temlau o waith llaw. Ni wasanaethir ef chwaith â dwylo dynol, fel pe bai arno angen rhywbeth, gan mai ef ei hun sy’n rhoi i bawb fywyd ac anadl a’r cwbl oll. Gwnaeth ef hefyd o un dyn yr holl genhedloedd, i breswylio ar holl wyneb y ddaear, gan osod cyfnodau penodedig a therfynau eu preswylfod. Yr oeddent i geisio Duw, yn y gobaith y gallent rywfodd ymbalfalu amdano a’i ddarganfod; ac eto nid yw ef nepell oddi wrth yr un ohonom. ‘Oherwydd ynddo ef yr ydym yn byw ac yn symud ac yn bod’, fel, yn wir, y dywedodd rhai o’ch beirdd chwi: ‘Canys ei hiliogaeth ef hefyd ydym ni.’ Os ydym ni, felly, yn hiliogaeth Duw, ni ddylem dybio fod y Duwdod yn debyg i aur neu arian neu faen, gwaith nadd celfyddyd a dychymyg dyn. Edrychodd Duw heibio, yn wir, i amserau anwybodaeth; ond yn awr y mae’n gorchymyn i bawb ym mhob man edifarhau, oblegid gosododd ddiwrnod pryd y bydd yn barnu’r byd mewn cyfiawnder, trwy ?r a benododd, ac fe roes sicrwydd o hyn i bawb trwy ei atgyfodi ef oddi wrth y meirw.”\n\nSalm 66.8-20\n\nBendithiwch ein Duw, O chwi bobloedd:\n\na seiniwch ei fawl yn glywadwy.\n\nEf a roes le i ni ymysg y byw:\n\nac ni adawodd i’n troed lithro.\n\nOherwydd buost yn ein profi, O Dduw:\n\nac yn ein coethi ni fel arian.\n\nDygaist ni i’r rhwyd:\n\nrhoist rwymau tynn amdanom.\n\nGadewaist i ddynion farchogaeth dros ein pennau,\n\naethom trwy dân a dyfroedd:\n\nond dygaist ni allan i ryddid.\n\nDof i’th deml â phoethoffrymau:\n\ntalaf i ti fy addunedau,\n\nYr addunedau a wneuthum â’m gwefusau:\n\nac a lefarodd fy ngenau pan oedd yn gyfyng arnaf.\n\nAberthaf i ti basgedigion yn boethoffrymau\n\na hefyd hyrddod yn arogldarth:\n\ndarparaf aberth ychen a buchod.\n\nDewch i wrando chwi oll sy’n ofni Duw:\n\nac adroddaf yr hyn wnaeth Duw i mi.\n\nGwaeddais â’m genau arno:\n\nac yr oedd ei foliant ar fy nhafod.\n\nPe byddai drygioni yn fy nghalon:\n\nni fuasai’r Arglwydd wedi gwrando.\n\nOnd yn wir gwrandawodd Duw arnaf:\n\na rhoes sylw i lef fy ngweddi.\n\nBendigedig fyddo Duw:\n\nam na throdd fy ngweddi oddi wrtho\n\nna’i ffyddlondeb oddi wrthyf.\n\n1 Pedr 3.13-22\n\nFelly, pwy a wna niwed ichwi os byddwch yn selog tros ddaioni? Ond hyd yn oed pe digwyddai ichwi ddioddef o achos cyfiawnder, gwyn eich byd! Peidiwch â’u hofni hwy, a pheidiwch â chymryd eich tarfu, ond sancteiddiwch Grist yn Arglwydd yn eich calonnau. Byddwch yn barod bob amser i roi ateb i bob un fydd yn ceisio gennych gyfrif am y gobaith sydd ynoch. Ond gwnewch hynny gydag addfwynder a pharchedig ofn, gan gadw eich cydwybod yn lân; ac yna, lle’r ydych yn awr yn cael eich sarhau, fe godir cywilydd ar y rhai sy’n dilorni eich ymarweddiad da yng Nghrist. Oherwydd gwell yw dioddef, os dyna ewyllys Duw, am wneud da nag am wneud drwg. Oherwydd dioddefodd Crist yntau un waith am byth dros bechodau, y cyfiawn dros yr anghyfiawn, i’ch dwyn chwi at Dduw. Er ei roi i farwolaeth o ran y cnawd, fe’i gwnaed yn fyw o ran yr ysbryd, ac felly yr aeth a chyhoeddi ei genadwri i’r ysbrydion yng ngharchar. Yr oedd y rheini wedi bod yn anufudd gynt, pan oedd Duw yn ei amynedd yn dal i ddisgwyl, yn nyddiau Noa ac adeiladu’r arch. Yn yr arch fe achubwyd ychydig, sef wyth enaid, trwy dd?r, ac y mae’r hyn sy’n cyfateb i hynny, sef bedydd, yn eich achub chwi yn awr, nid fel modd i fwrw ymaith fudreddi’r cnawd, ond fel ernes o gydwybod dda tuag at Dduw, trwy atgyfodiad Iesu Grist. Y mae ef, ar ôl mynd i mewn i’r nef, ar ddeheulaw Duw, a’r angylion a’r awdurdodau a’r galluoedd wedi eu darostwng iddo.\n\nIoan 14.15-21\n\nDywedodd Iesu: “Os ydych yn fy ngharu i, fe gadwch fy ngorchmynion i. Ac fe ofynnaf finnau i’m Tad, ac fe rydd ef i chwi Eiriolwr arall i fod gyda chwi am byth, Ysbryd y Gwirionedd. Ni all y byd ei dderbyn ef, am nad yw’r byd yn ei weld nac yn ei adnabod ef; yr ydych chwi yn ei adnabod, oherwydd gyda chwi y mae’n aros ac ynoch chwi y bydd. Ni adawaf chwi’n amddifad; fe ddof yn ôl atoch chwi. Ymhen ychydig amser, ni bydd y byd yn fy ngweld i ddim mwy, ond byddwch chwi’n fy ngweld, fy mod yn fyw; a byw fyddwch chwithau hefyd.

Ac os af a pharatoi lle i chwi, fe ddof yn ôl, a’ch cymryd chwi ataf fy hun, er mwyn i chwithau fod lle’r wyf fi. Fe wyddoch y ffordd i’r lle’r wyf fi’n mynd.” Meddai Thomas wrtho, “Arglwydd, ni wyddom i ble’r wyt yn mynd. Sut y gallwn wybod y ffordd?” Dywedodd Iesu wrtho, “Myfi yw’r ffordd a’r gwirionedd a’r bywyd. Nid yw neb yn dod at y Tad ond trwof fi. Os ydych wedi f’adnabod i, byddwch yn adnabod y Tad hefyd. Yn wir, yr ydych bellach yn ei adnabod ef ac wedi ei weld ef.” Meddai Philip wrtho, “Arglwydd, dangos i ni y Tad, a bydd hynny’n ddigon inni.” Atebodd Iesu ef, “A wyf wedi bod gyda chwi cyhyd heb i ti fy adnabod, Philip? Y mae’r sawl sydd wedi fy ngweld i wedi gweld y Tad. Sut y medri di ddweud, ‘Dangos i ni y Tad’? Onid wyt yn credu fy mod i yn y Tad, a’r Tad ynof fi? Y geiriau yr wyf fi’n eu dweud wrthych, nid ohonof fy hun yr wyf yn eu llefaru; y Tad sy’n aros ynof fi sydd yn gwneud ei weithredoedd ei hun. Credwch fi pan ddywedaf fy mod i yn y Tad, a’r Tad ynof fi; neu ynteu credwch ar sail y gweithredoedd eu hunain. Yn wir, yn wir, rwy’n dweud wrthych, bydd pwy bynnag sy’n credu ynof fi hefyd yn gwneud y gweithredoedd yr wyf fi’n eu gwneud; yn wir, bydd yn gwneud rhai mwy na’r rheini, oherwydd fy mod i’n mynd at y Tad. Beth bynnag a ofynnwch yn fy enw i, fe’i gwnaf, er mwyn i’r Tad gael ei ogoneddu yn y Mab. Os gofynnwch unrhyw beth i mi yn fy enw i, fe’i gwnaf.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOriel\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDarlleniadau’r Sul – Pasg 3 (A)\n\n\tActau 2. 14a, 36-41\n\nSafodd Pedr ynghyd â’r un ar ddeg, a chododd ei lais a’u hannerch: Felly gwybydded holl dŷ Israel yn sicr fod Duw wedi ei wneud ef yn Arglwydd ac yn Feseia, yr Iesu hwn a groeshoeliasoch chwi.” Pan glywsant hyn, fe’u dwysbigwyd yn eu calon, a dywedasant wrth Pedr a’r apostolion eraill, “Beth a wnawn ni, gyfeillion?” Meddai Pedr wrthynt, “Edifarhewch, a bedyddier pob un ohonoch yn enw Iesu Grist er maddeuant eich pechodau, ac fe dderbyniwch yr Ysbryd Glân yn rhodd. Oherwydd i chwi y mae’r addewid, ac i’ch plant ac i bawb sydd ymhell, pob un y bydd i’r Arglwydd ein Duw ni ei alw ato.” Ac â geiriau eraill lawer y tystiolaethodd ger eu bron, a’u hannog, “Dihangwch rhag y genhedlaeth wyrgam hon.” Felly bedyddiwyd y rhai a dderbyniodd ei air, ac ychwanegwyd atynt y diwrnod hwnnw tua thair mil o bersonau.\n\nSalm 116.1-4,12-19\n\nYr wyf yn caru’r Arglwydd am iddo wrando fy llais:\n\nac ar lef fy ngweddi;\n\nAm iddo droi ei glust ataf:\n\ny dydd y gwaeddais arno.\n\nYr oedd clymau angau wedi tynhau amdanaf\n\n     a gefynnau Sheol wedi fy nal:\n\na minnau’n dioddef adfyd ac ing.\n\nYna gelwais ar Enw’r Arglwydd:\n\n‘Yr wyf yn erfyn, Arglwydd, gwared fi!’\n\nSut y gallaf dalu i’r Arglwydd:\n\nam ei holl haelioni tuag ataf?\n\nDyrchafaf gwpan iachawdwriaeth:\n\na galw ar Enw’r Arglwydd.\n\nTalaf fy addunedau i’r Arglwydd:\n\nym mhresenoldeb ei holl bobl.\n\nPwysig yng ngolwg yr Arglwydd:\n\nyw marwolaeth ei ffyddloniaid.\n\nO Arglwydd, dy was yn wir wyf fi,\n\n     gwas o hil gweision:\n\nyr wyt wedi datod fy rhwymau.\n\nRhof i ti aberth diolch:\n\na galw ar Enw’r Arglwydd.\n\nTalaf fy addunedau i’r Arglwydd:\n\nym mhresenoldeb ei holl bobl,\n\nYng nghynteddau tŷ’r Arglwydd:\n\nyn dy ganol di, O Jerwsalem.\n\n     Molwch yr Arglwydd!\n\n1 Pedr 1. 17-23\n\nOs fel Tad yr ydych yn galw ar yr hwn sydd yn barnu’n ddidderbynwyneb yn ôl gwaith pob un, ymddygwch mewn parchedig ofn dros amser eich alltudiaeth.

Yr ydych wedi eich geni o’r newydd, nid o had llygradwy, ond anllygradwy, trwy air Duw, sydd yn fyw ac yn aros.\n\nLuc 24. 13-35\n\nYn awr, yr un dydd, yr oedd dau ohonynt ar eu ffordd i bentref, oddeutu un cilomedr ar ddeg o Jerwsalem, o’r enw Emaus. Yr oeddent yn ymddiddan â’i gilydd am yr holl ddigwyddiadau hyn. Yn ystod yr ymddiddan a’r trafod, nesaodd Iesu ei hun atynt a dechrau cerdded gyda hwy, ond rhwystrwyd eu llygaid rhag ei adnabod ef. Meddai wrthynt, “Beth yw’r sylwadau hyn yr ydych yn eu cyfnewid wrth gerdded?” Safasant hwy, a’u digalondid yn eu hwynebau. Atebodd yr un o’r enw Cleopas, “Rhaid mai ti yw’r unig ymwelydd â Jerwsalem nad yw’n gwybod am y pethau sydd wedi digwydd yno y dyddiau diwethaf hyn.” “Pa bethau?” meddai wrthynt. Atebasant hwythau, “Y pethau sydd wedi digwydd i Iesu o Nasareth, dyn oedd yn broffwyd nerthol ei weithredoedd a’i eiriau yng ngŵydd Duw a’r holl bobl. Traddododd ein prif offeiriaid ac aelodau ein Cyngor ef i’w ddedfrydu i farwolaeth, ac fe’i croeshoeliasant. Ein gobaith ni oedd mai ef oedd yr un oedd yn mynd i brynu Israel i ryddid, ond at hyn oll, heddiw yw’r trydydd dydd er pan ddigwyddodd y pethau hyn. Er hynny, fe’n syfrdanwyd gan rai gwragedd o’n plith; aethant yn y bore bach at y bedd, a methasant gael ei gorff, ond dychwelsant gan daeru eu bod wedi gweld angylion yn ymddangos, a bod y rheini’n dweud ei fod ef yn fyw. Aeth rhai o’n cwmni allan at y bedd, a’i gael yn union fel y dywedodd y gwragedd, ond ni welsant mohono ef.” Meddai Iesu wrthynt, “Mor ddiddeall ydych, a mor araf yw eich calonnau i gredu’r cwbl a lefarodd y proffwydi! Onid oedd yn rhaid i’r Meseia ddioddef y pethau hyn, a mynd i mewn i’w ogoniant?” A chan ddechrau gyda Moses a’r holl broffwydi, dehonglodd iddynt y pethau a ysgrifennwyd amdano ef ei hun yn yr holl Ysgrythurau. Wedi iddynt nesáu at y pentref yr oeddent ar eu ffordd iddo, cymerodd ef arno ei fod yn mynd ymhellach. Ond meddent wrtho, gan bwyso arno, “Aros gyda ni, oherwydd y mae hi’n nosi, a’r dydd yn dirwyn i ben.” Yna aeth i mewn i aros gyda hwy. Wedi cymryd ei le wrth y bwrdd gyda hwy, cymerodd y bara a bendithio, a’i dorri a’i roi iddynt. Agorwyd eu llygaid hwy, ac adnabuasant ef. A diflannodd ef o’u golwg. Meddent wrth ei gilydd, “Onid oedd ein calonnau ar dân ynom wrth iddo siarad â ni ar y ffordd, pan oedd yn egluro’r Ysgrythurau inni?” Codasant ar unwaith a dychwelyd i Jerwsalem. Cawsant yr un ar ddeg a’u dilynwyr wedi ymgynnull ynghyd ac yn dweud fod yr Arglwydd yn wir wedi ei gyfodi, ac wedi ymddangos i Simon. Adroddasant hwythau yr hanes am eu taith, ac fel yr oeddent wedi ei adnabod ef ar doriad y bara.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDarlleniadau’r Sul – Pasg 2 (A)\n\n\t\n\nActau 2.14a, 22-32\n\nSafodd Pedr ynghyd â’r un ar ddeg, a chododd ei lais a’u hannerch: “Bobl Israel, clywch hyn: sôn yr wyf am Iesu o Nasareth, gŵr y mae ei benodi gan Dduw wedi ei amlygu i chwi trwy wyrthiau a rhyfeddodau ac arwyddion a gyflawnodd Duw trwyddo ef yn eich mysg chwi, fel y gwyddoch chwi eich hunain. Yr oedd hwn wedi ei draddodi trwy fwriad penodedig a rhagwybodaeth Duw, ac fe groeshoeliasoch chwi ef drwy law estroniaid, a’i ladd. Ond cyfododd Duw ef, gan ei ryddhau o wewyr angau, oherwydd nid oedd dichon i angau ei ddal yn ei afael. Oherwydd y mae Dafydd yn dweud amdano: ‘Yr oeddwn yn gweld yr Arglwydd o’m blaen yn wastad, canys ar fy neheulaw y mae, fel na’m hysgydwer. Am hynny llawenychodd fy nghalon a gorfoleddodd fy nhafod, ie, a bydd fy nghnawd hefyd yn preswylio mewn gobaith; oherwydd ni fyddi’n gadael fy enaid yn Hades, nac yn gadael i’th Sanct weld llygredigaeth. Hysbysaist imi ffyrdd bywyd; byddi’n fy llenwi â llawenydd yn dy bresenoldeb.’ Gyfeillion, gallaf siarad yn hy wrthych am y patriarch Dafydd, iddo farw a chael ei gladdu, ac y mae ei fedd gyda ni hyd y dydd hwn. Felly, ac yntau’n broffwyd ac yn gwybod i Dduw dyngu iddo ar lw y gosodai un o’i linach ar ei orsedd, rhagweld atgyfodiad y Meseia yr oedd pan ddywedodd: ‘Ni adawyd ef yn Hades, ac ni welodd ei gnawd lygredigaeth.’ Yr Iesu hwn, fe gyfododd Duw ef, peth yr ydym ni oll yn dystion ohono.”\n\nSalm 16\n\nMichtam. I Ddafydd.\n\nCadw fi, O Dduw, oherwydd llochesaf ynot ti.\n\nDywedais wrth yr ARGLWYDD, “Ti yw f’arglwydd, nid oes imi ddaioni ond ynot ti.”\n\nAc am y duwiau sanctaidd sydd yn y wlad, melltith ar bob un sy’n ymhyfrydu ynddynt.\n\nAmlhau gofidiau y mae’r un sy’n blysio duwiau eraill; ni chynigiaf fi waed iddynt yn ddiodoffrwm, na chymryd eu henwau ar fy ngwefusau.\n\nTi, ARGLWYDD, yw fy nghyfran a’m cwpan, ti sy’n diogelu fy rhan;\n\nsyrthiodd y llinynnau i mi mewn mannau dymunol, ac y mae gennyf etifeddiaeth ragorol.\n\nBendithiaf yr ARGLWYDD a roddodd gyngor i mi; yn y nos y mae fy meddyliau’n fy hyfforddi.\n\nGosodais yr ARGLWYDD o’m blaen yn wastad; am ei fod ar fy neheulaw, ni’m symudir.\n\nAm hynny, llawenha fy nghalon a gorfoledda f’ysbryd, a chaiff fy nghnawd fyw’n ddiogel;\n\noherwydd ni fyddi’n gadael fy enaid i Sheol, ac ni chaiff yr un teyrngar i ti weld Pwll Distryw.\n\nDangosi i mi lwybr bywyd; yn dy bresenoldeb di y mae digonedd o lawenydd, ac yn dy ddeheulaw fwyniant bythol.\n\n1 Pedr 1.3-9\n\nBendigedig fyddo Duw a Thad ein Harglwydd Iesu Grist! O’i fawr drugaredd, fe barodd ef ein geni ni o’r newydd i obaith bywiol trwy atgyfodiad Iesu Grist oddi wrth y meirw, i etifeddiaeth na ellir na’i difrodi, na’i difwyno, na’i difa. Saif hon ynghadw yn y nefoedd i chwi, chwi sydd trwy ffydd dan warchod gallu Duw hyd nes y daw iachawdwriaeth, yr iachawdwriaeth sydd yn barod i’w datguddio yn yr amser diwethaf. Yn wyneb hyn yr ydych yn gorfoleddu, er eich bod, fe ddichon, yn awr yn profi blinder dros dro dan amrywiol brofedigaethau. Y mae hyn wedi digwydd er mwyn i ddilysrwydd eich ffydd chwi, sy’n fwy gwerthfawr na’r aur sy’n darfod — ac y mae hwnnw’n cael ei brofi trwy dân — gael ei amlygu er mawl a gogoniant ac anrhydedd pan ddatguddir Iesu Grist. Yr ydych yn ei garu ef, er na welsoch mohono; ac am eich bod yn awr yn credu ynddo heb ei weld, yr ydych yn gorfoleddu â llawenydd anhraethadwy a gogoneddus wrth ichwi fedi ffrwyth eich ffydd, sef iachawdwriaeth eich eneidiau.\n\nIoan 20.19-31\n\nGyda’r nos ar y dydd cyntaf hwnnw o’r wythnos, yr oedd y drysau wedi eu cloi lle’r oedd y disgyblion, oherwydd eu bod yn ofni’r Iddewon. A dyma Iesu’n dod ac yn sefyll yn eu canol, ac yn dweud wrthynt, “Tangnefedd i chwi!” Wedi dweud hyn, dangosodd ei ddwylo a’i ystlys iddynt. Pan welsant yr Arglwydd, llawenychodd y disgyblion. Meddai Iesu wrthynt eilwaith, “Tangnefedd i chwi! Fel y mae’r Tad wedi fy anfon i, yr wyf fi hefyd yn eich anfon chwi.” Ac wedi dweud hyn, anadlodd arnynt a dweud: “Derbyniwch yr Ysbryd Glân. Os maddeuwch bechodau rhywun, y maent wedi eu maddau; os peidiwch â’u maddau, y maent heb eu maddau.” Nid oedd Thomas, a elwir Didymus, un o’r Deuddeg, gyda hwy pan ddaeth Iesu atynt. Ac felly dywedodd y disgyblion eraill wrtho, “Yr ydym wedi gweld yr Arglwydd.” Ond meddai ef wrthynt, “Os na welaf ôl yr hoelion yn ei ddwylo, a rhoi fy mys yn ôl yr hoelion, a’m llaw yn ei ystlys, ni chredaf fi byth.” Ac ymhen wythnos, yr oedd y disgyblion unwaith eto yn y tŷ, a Thomas gyda hwy. A dyma Iesu’n dod, er bod y drysau wedi eu cloi, ac yn sefyll yn y canol a dweud, “Tangnefedd i chwi!” Yna meddai wrth Thomas, “Estyn dy fys yma. Edrych ar fy nwylo. Estyn dy law a’i rhoi yn fy ystlys. A phaid â bod yn anghredadun, bydd yn gredadun.” Atebodd Thomas ef, “Fy Arglwydd a’m Duw!” Dywedodd Iesu wrtho, “Ai am i ti fy ngweld i yr wyt ti wedi credu? Gwyn eu byd y rhai a gredodd heb iddynt weld.” Yr oedd llawer o arwyddion eraill, yn wir, a wnaeth Iesu yng ngŵydd ei ddisgyblion, nad ydynt wedi eu cofnodi yn y llyfr hwn. Ond y mae’r rhain wedi eu cofnodi er mwyn i chwi gredu mai Iesu yw’r Meseia, Mab Duw, ac er mwyn i chwi trwy gredu gael bywyd yn ei enw ef.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHanes yr eglwys\n\n\tCodwyd Eglwys y Santes Fair yn yr 1860au er mwyn rhoi cartref i gynulleidfa Gymraeg plwyf Aberystwyth. Ond mae ei hanes yn mynd yn ôl cyn hynny.\n\nCyn codi Eglwys y Santes Fair\n\nNi chafodd Aberystwyth ei sefydlu fel plwyf annibynnol tan 1861; tan yr amser hwnnw roedd yn rhan o blwyf Llanbadarn Fawr. Roedd i Lanbadarn hanes a thraddodiad hir yn mynd yn ôl i’r canol oesoedd hyd at yr eglwys Geltaidd gynnar pan oedd y clas, y gymuned o glerigwyr o dan awdurdod abad, a sefydlwyd yno yn un o brif ganolfannau Cristnogaeth yn ein gwlad. Roedd y plwyf yn un enfawr yn cynnwys y rhan fwyaf o ogledd Ceredigion. Yn raddol dechreuwyd rhannu’r plwyf mawr hwn yn blwyfi llai. Un o’r rhain oedd Aberystwyth.\n\nPan sefydlwyd y plwyf daeth Eglwys S. Mihangel yn eglwys y plwyf ond doedd dim cartref penodol i’r gynulleidfa Gymraeg. Cynhelid gwasanaethau Cymraeg mewn ysgoldy a safai lle mae Neuadd y Plwyf heddiw.\n\n\n\nYmdrechion yr 1850au\n\nMor gynnar ag 1851 cafodd pwyllgor ei sefydlu er mwyn dod o hyd i gartref oedd yn fwy addas ar gyfer y Cymry na’r ysgoldy. Roedd hwnnw’n llawer rhy fach ar gyfer cynulleidfa a oedd yn cynyddu fel yr oedd y dref yn tyfu’n gyflym. Cadeiriwyd y pwyllgor hwnnw gan ficer Llanbadarn Fawr, a chyn-gurad Eglwys S. Mihangel, y Parchg John Hughes (1787-1860), dyn rhyfeddol o egnïol yng ngwasanaeth ei Arglwydd a’i Waredwr a ddaeth yn ddiweddarach yn Archddiacon Ceredigion. Casglwyd arian ar gyfer y gwaith a phenodwyd y pensaer Richard Kyrke Penson (1815-1885) i lunio cynlluniau er mwyn ceisio denu cymorth ariannol pellach oddi wrth yr Incorpoated Church Building Society er mwyn dechrau ar y gwaith. Gwrthodwyd grant iddynt yn 1854 ac mae’n ymddangos fod hynny wedi bod yn siom oherwydd fe dawelodd y sôn am eglwys Gymraeg am dipyn.\n\n\n\nSefydlu plwyf Aberystwyth a chodi Eglwys y Santes Fair\n\nWedi sefydlu Aberystwyth yn blwyf ar wahân gyda’r Parchg Evan Owen Phillips (1825-1897) yn ficer fe aed o’r newydd i geisio codi eglwys ar gyfer y gynulleidfa Gymraeg. Mae’n amlwg nad oedd ofn gwaith ar y ficer gan ei fod ar yr un pryd wedi mynd ati i godi arian er mwyn ail-adeiladu eglwys y plwyf.\n\nCasglwyd digon o arian i ddechrau ar y gwaith, a’r tro hwn y pensaer a ddewiswyd gan Phillips oedd un o’r mwyaf amlwg yn ei gyfnod, sef William Butterfield (1814-1900). Roedd Butterfield yn perthyn i’r mudiad ‘eglwysigol’, neu ecclesiological, a oedd yn adlewyrchiad pensaernïol o nifer o ddyheadau ac egwyddorion Mudiad Rhydychen. Credai Butterfield y dylai adeilad fod yn gyfan gwbwl yng ngwasanaeth addoliad yr eglwys gyda’r ysbrydol yn cael ei adlewyrchu mewn defod a sacrament. Gwaith y pensaer oedd darparu’r gofod oedd ei angen ar gyfer hynny. Roedd Butterfield yn bendant iawn ei farn ar lawer o bethau. Buasai’r clustogau pen-glin a’n carpedi ni heddiw yn anathema i Butterfield a ddywedodd eu bod yn perthyn i “the rich man’s tradition, and they usually mean appropriation. A hassock is a stumbling block, even to the youngest and most agile…”\n\n\n\nFelly nid un i gyfaddawdu oedd Butterfield, na Phillips ychwaith, ac fe arweiniodd hynny at dipyn o anghydweld rhwng y ddau ac fe ddaeth eu perthynas i ben cyn gorffen adeiladau Eglwys y Santes Fair ac fe aeth sôn am unrhyw gydweithio pellach rhyngddynt i’r gwellt. Ond fe lwyddwyd i godi Eglwys y Santes Fair yn 1865-1866 ac fe’i hagorwyd yn wreiddiol fel ‘capel gorffwys’. Trwyddedwyd yr adeilad ar gyfer cynnal gwasanaethau fis Awst 1867. Bu’n rhaid aros am bron i chwe blynedd cyn i’r adeilad gael ei gysegru. Gwnaed hynny ar 2 Mehefin 1873 gan esgob Tyddewi, y Gwir Barchg Connop Thirlwall.\n\nNid un i orffwys oedd Phillips oherwydd yn 1886 agorwyd eglwys arall yn y dref, sef Eglwys y Drindod, a ffurfiwyd plwyf newydd arall allan o ran o Lanbadarn Fawr, sef plwyf y Drindod Sanctaidd, Aberystwyth.\n\nYn 1910 agorwyd Eglwys S. Anne, ym mhlwyf S. Mihangel, Aberystwyth, er mwyn gwasanaethu pentref Penparcau a oedd yn datblygu’n gyflym.\n\nSefydlu plwyf rheithorol Aberystwyth\n\nYn 1969 gwelwyd newid yn nhrefniadau eglwysig Aberystwyth pan unwyd y ddau blwyf i greu un plwyf newydd, a hwnnw’n dwyn y teitl plwyf rheithorol – hynny yw plwyf gyda rheithor yn arwain a nifer o ficeriaid yn gwasanaethu ynddo; dyma’r tro cyntaf i drefniant o’r fath ddigwydd yn esgobaeth Tyddewi. Erbyn heddiw y mae plwyf Llanychaearn wedi dod yn rhan o blwyf Aberystwyth, sy’n golygu fod pump eglwys yn y plwyf, ac o’r rheiny yn Eglwys y Santes Fair yn unig y cynhelir gwasanaethau Cymraeg.\n\nNewidiadau \n\nYn gyffredinol gellid dweud fod adeiladwaith ac addurn Eglwys y Santes Fair yn syml, ond mae nodweddion y mudiad eglwysigol i’w weld fan hyn a fan draw fel y disgwylid mewn eglwys gan William Butterfield ac mae hynny’n arbennig o wir yn yr addurn aml-liwiog, neu’r polychromatic, a welir yn yr adeilad. Yn Eglwys y Santes Fair paent ar garreg yw’r addurn, ond yn nifer o eglwysi mae’r addurn aml-liwiog wedi’i adeiladu i fewn i furiau brics yr adeilad ei hun, fel sydd i’w weld yn un arall o eglwysi Butterfiels, Eglwys S. Awstin, Penarth, a gwblhawyd yn yr un flwyddyn ag Eglwys y Santes Fair.\n\n\n\nNid fu newidiadau mawr iawn i’r adeilad ers ei godi. Gosodwyd sustem wresogi yn 1906 a defnyddiwyd hynny fel cyfle i wneud peth addurno ac adnewyddu. Dros y blynyddoedd bu gofal gweinidog a chynulleidfa yn fawr o’r adeilad. Yn ystod yr 1980au ail-baentiwyd yr adeilad oddi fewn gan adfer llawer o’r gwaith lliw oedd wedi diflannu o dan wyngalch dros y blynyddoedd; yn arbennig y reredos y tu ôl i’r bwrdd sanctaidd. Yn y 1990au cafwyd nifer o fân newidiadau eraill. Yn gyntaf ychwanegwyd cegin a thŷ bach yng nghefn yr eglwys. Wedyn gosodwyd sustem wresogi ychwanegol a thua’r un adeg tynnwyd nifer o’r corau o gefn yr eglwys. Gwnaed hynny er mwyn creu ardal lle’r oedd hi’n bosib cynnal gweithgareddau ar gyfer plant yr ysgol Sul ac er mwyn rhoi gofod i bobol gymdeithasu yn dilyn y gwasanaethau.\n\nDodrefn ‘ail-law’\n\n\n\nUn o hynodion yr eglwys yw fod peth o’r dodrefn a’r addurniadau ynddi wedi dod o eglwys arall, sef eglwys y plwyf, ac felly yn hŷn na’r adeilad ei hun. Wrth i’r adeilad hwnnw gael ei ail-adeiladu a’i adnewyddu roedd rhai eitemau ar gael i’r ‘chwaer fach’. O fan hynny daeth y gwydr lliw ar gyfer ffenest ddwyreiniol. Mae honno yn dyddio o 1861 ac yn waith y cwmni enwog Heaton, Butler & Bayne a fu’n gyfrifol am greu miloedd o ffenestri lliw ar gyfer eglwysi ar hyd Cymru a Lloegr. Sefydlwyd y cwmni yn 1852 gan Clement Heaton (1824–1882); ymunodd James Butler (1830-1913) yn 1857, yn 1862 daeth Robert Bayne (1837-1915) yn rhan o’r bartneriaeth. Mae hon felly yn ffenestr gynnar ganddynt – ac felly nid yw’n waith gan crefftwyr ac artistiaid profiadol – ac mae’n dangos ymdrech Crist yng Ngethsemane, ei groeshoelio ar Galfaria, a’i atgyfodiad buddugoliaethus fore’r trydydd dydd.\n\nO eglwys y plwyf hefyd hefyd y daeth yr organ.

Roedd Mair Magdalen a’r Fair arall wedi bod yno yn eistedd gyferbyn â’r bedd yn gwylio’r cwbl. Y diwrnod wedyn, hynny ydy y dydd Saboth, dyma’r prif offeiriaid a’r Phariseaid yn mynd i weld Peilat. “Syr,” medden nhw wrtho, “un peth ddwedodd y twyllwr yna pan oedd e’n dal yn fyw oedd, ‘Bydda i’n dod yn ôl yn fyw ymhen deuddydd.’ Felly wnei di orchymyn i’r bedd gael ei wneud yn ddiogel hyd drennydd. Bydd hynny’n rhwystro’i ddisgyblion rhag dod a dwyn y corff, a mynd o gwmpas wedyn yn dweud wrth bobl ei fod wedi dod yn ôl yn fyw. Byddai’r twyll yna’n waeth na’r twyll cyntaf!” “Cymerwch filwyr,” meddai Peilat, “ac ewch i wneud y bedd mor ddiogel ag y gallwch chi.” Felly dyma nhw’n mynd a gosod sêl ar y garreg oedd dros geg y bedd, a rhoi milwyr ar ddyletswydd i’w gwarchod.

Fel Eglwyswyr, neu Anglicaniaid, yr ydym yn datgan ein ffydd yn wythnosol gan ddefnyddio ffurfiau traddodiadol yr eglwys Gatholig, neu’r eglwys gyffredinol, sef Credo’r Apostolion a Chredo Nicea. Crynodebau o brif elfennau cred y Cristion yw’r datganiadau yma; fe’u lluniwyd gan yr eglwys yn seiliedig ar y Beibl mewn ymateb i sefyllfaoedd arbennig.\n\nFel arfer defnyddiwn Gredo’r Apostolion yng ngwasanaethau’r Foreol a’r Hwyrol Weddi a Chredo Nicea yng ngwasanaeth y Cymun Bendigaid.\n\nCredo’r Apostolion\n\nYn wahanol i’r enw nid yr apostolion, disgyblion gwreiddiol Iesu, yw awduron y credo hwn. Ond y mae’r credo yn ddatganiad cynnar iawn o’r hyn yr oedd Cristnogion yn ei gredu ac fe’i lluniwyd yn ystod canrifoedd cynnar Cristnogaeth fel cyfres o ddatganiadau mewn iaith syml er mwyn ateb rhai o gamsyniadau Gnosticiaeth, mudiad a dyfodd o fewn i Gristnogaeth gynnar a oedd yn gwadu fod Iesu yn fod dynol mewn gwirionedd. Yn ddiweddarach daeth Credo’r Apostolion i’w gysylltu gyda bedydd ac fe’i defnyddiwyd gan ymgeiswyr fel dull cryno o ddatgan eu cred cyn derbyn y sacrament hwnnw.\n\nMae’r llyfr Ffydd i fyw: y credo Cristnogol a’i ystyr (Cyhoeddiadau’r Gair, 1998) yn esboniad cryno a hawdd i’w ddeall ar Gredo’r Apostolion.\n\nCredaf yn Nuw, y Tad hollalluog,\n\ncreadwr nefoedd a daear.\n\nCredaf yn Iesu Grist, ei unig Fab, ein Harglwydd ni.\n\nFe’i cenhedlwyd trwy rym yr Ysbryd Glân\n\na’i eni o’r Wyryf Mair.\n\nDioddefodd dan Pontius Pilat,\n\nfe’i croeshoeliwyd, bu farw, ac fe’i claddwyd.\n\nDisgynnodd i blith y meirw.\n\nAr y trydydd dydd fe atgyfododd.\n\nFe esgynnodd i’r nefoedd,\n\nac y mae’n eistedd ar ddeheulaw’r Tad.\n\nFe ddaw drachefn i farnu’r byw a’r meirw.\n\nCredaf yn yr Ysbryd Glân,\n\nyr Eglwys Lân Gatholig,\n\ncymundeb y saint,\n\nmaddeuant pechodau,\n\natgyfodiad y corff\n\na’r bywyd tragwyddol. Amen.\n\n\nCredo Nicea\n\nOs yw Credo’r Apostolion yn defnyddio iaith syml mae Credo Nicea yn defnyddio iaith dechnegol er mwyn trin a thrafod rhai o bynciau diwinyddol mwyaf llosg y bedwaredd ganrif. Mae’r credo yn llawnach na Chredo’r Apostolion ac yn adlewyrchu trafodaethau dau gyngor cyffredinol o arweinwyr yr eglwys a gyfarfu yn Nicea (dinas İznik yn Nhwrci heddiw) yn 325 ac yng Nghaergystennin (dinas Istanbul heddiw) yn 381. Weithiau caiff ei alw yn Gredo Nicea-Caergystennin oherwydd hyn. Fe’i lluniwyd yn wreiddiol i ateb rhai oedd am newid neu wrthod yr hyn a oedd yn cael ei gredu’n gyffredinol yn yr eglwys, yn bennaf dysgeidiaeth henuriad (presbyter) o Alexandria yn yr Aifft, sef Arius. Roedd yr hyn yr oedd yntau yn ei ddysgu am berthynas Duw y Tad ac Iesu yn wahanol i’r hyn yr oedd yr eglwys wedi’i gredu a’i ddysgu am y Drindod. Er mwyn deall y Credo yn llawn rhaid ceisio deall peth o’r drafodaeth hon.\n\n\n\nPorth Lefke, İznik (Nicea). Ffoto: Utuku Bayram\n\nGydag amser daeth Credo Nicea yn ffon fesur ar gyfer y ffydd Gristnogol ac o ganlyniad yn arwydd o uniongrededd. Caiff ei dderbyn bellach gan eglwysi Catholig Rhufeinig, Lutheraidd, Anglicanaidd, Methodistaidd a Diwygiedig fel ei gilydd. Golyga hyn ei fod o bwys fel dull o fynegi undod ffydd y gymuned Gristnogol dros y canrifoedd.

Yn y Beibl, a roddwyd i ni trwy’r Ysbryd Glân, yr ydym yn darllen hanes Duw yn datguddio ei hun trwy ei bobl Israel ac yn bennaf oll yn ei Fab. Ymateb i Dduw yn datguddio ei gariad a’i drugaredd wrth ymddired ynddo yw’r cam cyntaf ar daith ffydd. Eto i gyd mae’n bwysig dweud nad ffeithiau yw calon ein ffydd, yn hytrach y ffeithiau yw’r rheswm dros ymddiried, neu roi ein ffydd yn Nuw, a’r ymddiried hynny yw dechrau ein perthynas ag ef.\n\nOnd mae ein ffydd yn cychwyn nid gyda ni ond gyda Duw, ac yntau yn dod yn ddyn er ein mwyn ni. Dyna fyddwn ni yn ei ddathlu yn nhymor y Nadolig.\n\nDanfonodd y Tad ei Fab, ac fe ddaeth yn ddyn, er mwyn cymodi’r byd ag ef ei hun. Bu farw ar y groes dros ein pechodau; atgyfodwyd ef mewn buddugoliaeth ar angau a’i ddyrchafu i orsedd Duw fel yr un sy’n eiriol trosom. Dyna fyddwn yn ei ddathlu yn nhymor y Pasg.\n\nAddawodd y Mab anfon yr Ysbryd Glân i ddod â bywyd. Wrth droi oddi wrth ein pechodau a chredu yn Iesu Grist daw yr Ysbryd i fyw ynom. Ei bresenoldeb ef yn ein bywydau ni, ac ym mywyd yr eglwys, sydd yn ein galluogi i ddilyn Iesu ac i dyfu’n debyg iddo. Dyna fyddwn yn ei ddathlu yn nhymor y Pentecost.\n\nMae’n perthynas â Duw yn esgor ar berthynas newydd gydag eraill wrth inni ddod yn gyd-aelodau o gorff Crist, sef yr Eglwys. Yr ydym yn ymateb i gariad Duw mewn addoliad yn nheulu’r Eglwys trwy weddi, darllen ei Air sanctaidd, a thrwy sacrament y bedydd sanctaidd a’r cymun bendigaid. Yr ydym yn ymateb hefyd trwy ei arddel yn Arglwydd ar ein bywydau a gweithio er ei anrhydedd a’i ogoniant.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDydd Gwener y Groglith\n\n\tRoedd mam Iesu yn sefyll wrth ymyl ei groes, a hefyd ei fodryb, a Mair gwraig Clopas a Mair Magdalen. Pan welodd Iesu ei fam yn sefyll yno, a’r disgybl oedd Iesu’n ei garu’n fawr yn sefyll gyda hi, meddai wrth ei fam, “Mam annwyl, cymer e fel mab i ti,” ac meddai wrth y disgybl, “Gofala amdani hi fel petai’n fam i ti.” Felly o hynny ymlaen aeth mam Iesu i fyw gyda’r disgybl hwnnw. Roedd Iesu’n gwybod ei fod wedi gwneud popeth oedd gofyn iddo’i wneud. “Dw i’n sychedig,” meddai, gan gyflawni beth oedd yr ysgrifau sanctaidd yn ei ddweud. Roedd jwg o win chwerw rhad wrth ymyl, felly dyma nhw’n trochi ysbwng yn y gwin a’i rwymo ar goesyn isop i’w godi i fyny at wefusau Iesu. Ar ôl cael diod, dyma Iesu’n dweud, “Mae’r cwbl wedi ei wneud.” Yna plygodd ei ben a marw. (Ioan 19.25-30, allan o beibl.net)\n\n\n\nY croeshoelio gyda Mair ac Ioan, gan Antonello da Messina, 1475.

Aleliwia!\n\n\tYna’n gynnar fore Sul, pan oedd y Saboth Iddewig drosodd, a hithau’n dechrau gwawrio, dyma Mair Magdalen a’r Fair arall yn mynd i edrych ar y bedd. Yn sydyn roedd daeargryn mawr. Dyma angel yr Arglwydd yn dod i lawr o’r nefoedd a rholio’r garreg oddi ar geg y bedd ac eistedd arni. Roedd wyneb yr angel yn disgleirio’n llachar fel mellten, a’i ddillad yn wyn fel eira. Roedd y milwyr yn crynu gan ofn a dyma nhw’n llewygu. Yna dyma’r angel yn dweud wrth y gwragedd, “Peidiwch bod ag ofn. Dw i’n gwybod eich bod chi’n edrych am Iesu, yr un gafodd ei groeshoelio. Dydy e ddim yma; mae wedi dod yn ôl yn fyw! Dyna’n union beth ddwedodd fyddai’n digwydd. Dewch yma i weld lle bu’n gorwedd. Yna ewch ar frys a dweud hyn wrth ei ddisgyblion: ‘Mae Iesu wedi dod yn ôl yn fyw, ac mae’n mynd o’ch blaen chi i Galilea. Cewch ei weld yno.’ Edrychwch, fi sydd wedi dweud wrthoch chi.” Felly dyma’r gwragedd yn rhedeg i ffwrdd ar frys i ddweud wrth y disgyblion. Roedden nhw wedi dychryn, ac eto roedden nhw’n teimlo rhyw wefr. Yna’n sydyn dyma Iesu’n eu cyfarfod nhw. “Helo,” meddai. Dyma nhw’n rhedeg ato ac yn gafael yn ei draed a’i addoli. “Peidiwch bod ag ofn,” meddai Iesu wrthyn nhw, “Ewch i ddweud wrth fy mrodyr i am fynd i Galilea; byddan nhw’n cael fy ngweld i yno.” (Mathew 28.1-10, allan o beibl.net)\n\n\n\nY Crist atgyfodedig, gan Fra Angelico, 1450.

Bydd gwasanaeth y Cymun Bendigaid a’r Foreol a’r Hwyrol Weddi yn dilyn trefn o’r fath. Offeiriad fydd yn llywyddu yng ngwasanaetha y Cymun Bendigaid ond bydd aelodau eraill o’r gynulleidfa yn cymryd rhan trwy arwain y gweddïau neu ddarllen y llithoedd. Yn yr Hwyrol Weddi mae’n arferol i ddarllenydd lleyg arwain y gwasanaeth a phrgethu.\n\nAr adegau eraill, fel yng ngwasanaeth Grym Mawl a’r Gwasanaeth i deulu’r eglwys, byddwn ni’n dilyn trefn sy’n fwy anffurfiol.\n\nFel arfer bydd ein holl wasanaethau yn cynnwys gweddïau, caneuon ac emynau, a darlleniadau o’r Beibl.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCysylltu gyda ni\n\n\tOs ydych chi am gysylltu gyda ni fe fe allwch wneud hynny trwy’r Rheithor, y Parchg Ganon Stuart Bell, yn y Rheithordy, Maes Lowri, Aberystwyth, SY23 2AU.

Mae plwyf Aberystwyth yn cynnwys y dref ei hun, Penparcau a phentref Llanfarian (Llanychaearn) ac mae pedair eglwys arall yn y plwyf: Eglwys S. Mihangel a Eglwys y Drindod yn Aberystwyth, Eglwys S. Anne ym Mhenparcau, ac Eglwys S. Llwchaearn ger Llanfarian. Gwasanaethau Saesneg a gynhelir yn yr eglwysi hyn i gyd.\n\nMae’r plwyf yn rhan o Esgobaeth Tyddewi, sydd yn ei thro yn rhan o’r Eglwys yng Nghymru. Rydym felly yn perthyn i deulu’r Cymundeb Anglicanaidd o eglwysi ar draws y byd.\n\nCynhelir holl weithgaredd Eglwys y Santes Fair yn Gymraeg a chredwn ei bod wedi’n galw i weinidogaethau i siaradwyr brodorol a dysgwyr fel ei gilydd. Ar hyn o bryd y mae rhyw 30-40 o oedolion a rhyw 15-20 o blant a phobol ifainc yn rhan o deulu’r eglwys.\n\nMae dau weinidog llawn amser yn rhannu eu hamser rhwng Eglwys y Santes Fair ac Eglwys S. Mihangel: rheithor y plwyf, sef y Parchg Ganon Stuart Bell, a’r ficer, y Parchg Andy Herrick. Yn ogystal mae Ann McKnight yn gweithio fel cynorthwyydd bugeiliol gwirfoddol rhan-amser.\n\nOnd nid hwy sy’n gwneud y gwaith i gyd yn Eglwys y Santes Fair. Ceir pob math o weithwyr eraill: darllenwyr (pregethwyr) lleyg, darllenwyr llithoedd, glanhawyr, rhai sy’n gwneud coffi, organyddion, aelodau’r gr?p cerdd, arweinwyr gweddïau, trysorydd, rhai sy’n gosod blodau. Fel hyn y disgrifiodd yr apostol Paul y peth yn ei lythyr at Gristnogion Corinth: “Mae gwahanol ddoniau, ond yr un Ysbryd sy’n rhoi pob un.   Mae ffyrdd gwahanol o wasanaethu, ond dim ond un Arglwydd sydd. Mae Duw yn gweithio mewn ffyrdd gwahanol drwy wahanol bobl, ond yr un Duw sy’n cyflawni’r cwbl ynddyn nhw i gyd. Ac mae’r Ysbryd i’w weld yn gweithio ym mywyd pob unigolyn er lles pawb arall.” (1 Corinthiaid 12.4-7, allan o beibl.net)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBle mae Eglwys y Santes Fair?\n\n\tMae Eglwys y Santes Fair yn sefyll yn Y Lôn Gefn (neu Gray’s Inn Road) yn Aberystwyth.

It will explore in detail the entire process of submission and handling from examination entry form through to the upload of the final thesis. The project will chart the varied workflows of students, of examiners and of the Examinations Office, school offices and the Bibliographic Services team. \n\nAims and Objectives \n\nThe project has a number of related aims: \n\n\tTo build an institutional e-theses repository within an existing FEDORA environment \n\n\tTo develop an e-theses policy and procedures \n\n\tTo implement an efficient, streamlined workflow for e-theses creation, submission, management and description \n\n\tTo share expertise with the wider sector and develop useful models and tools to support e-theses work at other HEIs \n\n\tTo expand and enhance the EThOS Toolkit \n\n\n\nThe project will draft an institutional solution to managing e-theses within the EThOS framework that is effective on three levels: \n\n\tTechnical â€“ creating a repository that is fully compliant with EThOS requirements \n\n\tProcedural â€“ taking an approach that supports academic regulations and legal and security requirements \n\n\tCultural â€“ reflecting the Collegeâ€™s standards of quality assurance and the expectations of staff and students \n\n\n\nProject Methodology \n\nThe Project will engage with a range of stake-holders across College including students, academics, the College Board of Examiners, the Examinations Office and school level administration. Staff from Information Services and Systems (ISS) will be actively and consistently involved including the Bibliographic Services team, Research Support teams, technical ITS staff and the College Web Team. \n\nThe project is structured into six work packages: \n\n\tPreparation & recruitment \n\n\tSpecification \n\n\tWorkflow (analysis and tool development) \n\n\tRepository (specify, build, develop) \n\n\tSupporting resources (develop, deliver) \n\n\tReporting and dissemination (project outputs and events) \n\n\nAnticipated Outputs and Outcomes \n\nIn terms of outcomes the project will: \n\n\tPromote e-theses and support cultural change at Kingâ€™s \n\n\tProvide an exemplar for the sector. Despite local differences the examinations process is broadly similar everywhere. Forms for research students, submission rules and handling procedures are largely the same \n\n\tSupport and enhance the EThOS Toolkit with a worked institutional implementation that deals in detail with issues that are only currently covered in outline \n\n\nPractical outputs will include: \n\n\tWorkflow models and workflow tools to support students, examiners and administrators through the tasks of creating, submitting, processing, describing and publishing e-theses \n\n\tA model institutional policy for e-theses along with supporting procedures and forms \n\n\tGuidance notes to support the implementation of an e-theses policy \n\n\tAn EThOS compliant repository that meets required standards in terms of format, structure, metadata and so on \n\n\nThe project will run from September 2007. By the end of the project the e-theses workflow will be fully implemented by the College and will be wholly integrated into the normal work of the College. \n\nThe benefits of the project will be shared with the wider sector through direct interaction with EThOSnet, professional bodies and other institutions. \n\nTechnology/Standards Used \n\nThese will include: \n\n\tFedora (Flexible Extensible Digital Object and Repository Architecture) \n\n\tQualified Dublin Core \n\n\tOAI-PMH \n\n\tXML and HTML \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\tproject staff\n\n\t\tProject Managers \n\n\tRussell Burke, Electronic Resources Co-ordinator, ISS russell.burke@kcl.ac.uk \n\n\tCatriona Cannon, Bibliographic Services Manager, ISS catriona.cannon@kcl.ac.uk \n\n\nProject team \n\n\tVikas Deora, Project Researcher, ISS, vikas.deora@kcl.ac.uk, Tel: 020 7848 3845\n\n\nrelated projects\n\tAIR (Automated Archiving for an Institutional Repository)\n\tAn institutional repository for Nottingham Trent University\n\tBradford University Repository Project â€“ BURP!\n\tBridging the interoperability divide (BID)\n\tBucks Knowledge Archive\n\tCommon Institutional Repositories for Collaborative Learning Environments (CIRCLE)\n\tCoventry University repository validation & enhancement (CURVE)\n\tCTREP - Cambridge Tetra Repositories Enhancement Project\n\tDeveloping repositories at Worcester repository service (DRAW)\n\tDISC-UK DataShare\n\teCrystals Federation\n\tEmbed\n\tEmbedding repositories & consortial enhancement SHERPA-LEAP (EMBRACE)\n\tEThOSnet\n\tFaroes: Repositories for Sharing Learning Resources in Distributed Social Spaces\n\tFedorazon\n\tImplementing an institutional repository for Leeds Metropolitan University\n\tIncreasing repository content through automation and services (IncReASe)\n\tInstitutional research repository for the University of Salford\n\tJazzhub\n\tKCL Committee Zone\n\tKULTUR\n\tLincoln Repository of Learning Materials (LIROLEM)\n\tMathematics Question Bank\n\tMoodle Repository Create, Upload, Tag and Embed (MR-CUTE)\n\tNECTAR â€“ Northampton Electronic Collection of Theses And Research\n\tOpen Access Repository System for Forced Migration Online (OARS)\n\tOverlay journal infrastructure for Meteorological Sciences (OJIMS)\n\tPractice-as-Research in Music Online (PRIMO)\n\tProject on Open Content for Knowledge Exposition and Teaching (POCKET)\n\tRepository of AG Collaborative Events (RACE)\n\tRE-space - Repository Enhancement for e-space, the digital e-prints repository at Manchester Metropolitan University\n\tROAR@UEL\n\tSocial Networking Extensions for Eprints (SNEEP)\n\tSound Archives Film Images Repository (SAFIR)\n\tStart-up and Enhancement Projects Training (SUETr)\n\tStorage space\n\tUniversity of Bolton institutional repository\n\tUniversity of Hertfordshire Research Archive (UHRA)\n\tUPlaCe\n\twALTer\n\tWarwick Research Archive Project (WRAP)\n\tWelsh Repository Network\n\tYSJ Digirep\n\n\n\ndocuments and multimedia\n\tFrom Entry to EThOS Project Plan\nMicrosoft Word Document 200 Kb\n\tFrom Entry to EThOS Work Packages\nMicrosoft Word Document 130 Kb\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t© 2007 HEFCE,\n\t\ton behalf of JISC\n\tPrivacy statement\n\tJob vacancies\n\tFreedom of information\n\tJISC Involve blogs\n\tLast updated on 25/06/08 by Kerry Ann Down\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFontsize disabled - Your browser does not support JavaScript\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n",

In an environment that is becoming increasingly gender neutral, we seek to facilitate an engaging session where women can share their expertise, experience and ideas with each other\n\t\n\t support the articulation of strong, clear arguments about the value of the women's sector, and the importance of women-only and women-led services. These articulations are increasingly vital to funders/policy makers working with no gender analysis as a framework.\n\n\n\n\nWRC are launching their Why Women campaign in March 2006, to highlight the need for a strong and sustainable women's voluntary and community sector. We will use the material that comes out of these sessions as part of our research about the women's sector, in order to write a briefing about the value and importance of women-only and women-led services.\n\n\t To book a place please email info@wrc.org.uk, download a booking form from http://www.wrc.org.uk or call WRC on 020 7324 3040\n\t\n\t For more information you can read descriptions in the WRC training calendar at http://www.wrc.org.uk or call Darlene at WRC on 020 7324 3036.\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the top of these page\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n",

Nodwyd i’r Comisiwn ofyn i Gyngor Bwrdeistref Sirol Pen-y-bont ar Ogwr am y ffigurau, \nond ni chafwyd ymateb hyd yma. \n \n3.2.3 Cytunwyd y byddai’r Comisiwn yn cysylltu â Chyngor Bwrdeistref Sirol Pen-y-bont ar \nOgwr eto yn gofyn am y ffigurau. \n \n3.2.4 Petai ffigurau’n dod i law, cytunwyd y byddai paragraff diwygiedig yn cael ei ddosbarthu \ndros yr e-bost i’w glirio, ac ar ôl ei gymeradwyo, byddai’r Comisiwn yn mynd ymlaen i \ngyhoeddi cynigion drafft.. \n \n \n4.

Dymunai’r Comisiynwyr gofnodi eu diolchiadau i Mr Chapman am ei gefnogaeth a’r \ncymorth a roddodd iddynt yn ystod ei amser yn y Comisiwn. \n \n11.2.3 Er bod y Comisiwn yn chwilio am rywun i gymryd lle Mr Chapman, nodwyd ei bod hi’n \ndebygol y byddai goblygiadau o ran gwahanu’r dyletswyddau mewn perthynas â phrynu a \nchael nwyddau a gwasanaethau. \n \n11.2.4. Cytunwyd y byddai cymorth Adran LGM2, Adran noddi’r Comisiwn, yn cael ei geisio yn \nystod y cyfnod pontio hwn, y gobeithid y byddai’n fyr. \n \n11.2.5 Nodwyd bod hysbyseb mewn perthynas â swydd Mr Chapman wedi ei osod o fewn y \nCynulliad fel cyfle am secondiad. \n \n11.3 Y Pwyllgor Llywodraeth Leol a Gwasanaethau Cyhoeddus. \n \n11.3.1 Nodwyd mewn cyfarfod diweddar y Pwyllgor Llywodraeth Leol a Gwasanaethau \nCyhoeddus, fod y Gweinidog wedi adrodd ei bod hi wedi mynychu ac wedi annerch \nCyfarfod Cyffredinol Agored Blynyddol y Comisiwn, a’i bod yn dymuno achub ar y cyfle i \nddiolch i’r Comisiwn am ei waith. \n \n11.4 Cynhadledd Llywodraethu Cymru \n \n11.4.1 Mynychodd y Comisiynydd Dennis Roberts Gynhadledd “Llywodraethu Cymru : Deall \nPerthnasoedd Allweddol” a gynhaliwyd 18 Tachwedd 2004 yng Nghaerdydd, a rhoddodd \nyr adroddiad canlynol: \n“Roedd hi’n gynhadledd ddiddorol ac eithaf addysgiadol.  Y prif siom oedd nad \nymddangosodd dau o’r siaradwyr.  Y siaradwyr hyn oedd Elizabeth Raikes o ELWa a Lyn \nLlewelyn o Un Llais Cymru.  Y siom i mi oedd nad oedd y drafodaeth am Gyrff Cyhoeddus \na Noddir gan y Cynulliad mor gynhwysfawr ag y gallai wedi bod. \n \nRoedd y siaradwyr eraill o’r radd flaenaf ac yn cynnwys:- \nJohn Osmond Cyfarwyddwr y Sefydliad Materion Cymreig \nChris Freeguard Rheolwr Gyfarwyddwr Cyngor Dinas Casnewydd \nLaura McAllister Aelod o Gomisiwn Richard \nGweler isod rai eitemau o’r cyflwyniadau a oedd yn ddiddorol. \nJohn Osmond \nRhoddwyd arolwg cynhwysfawr o waith Comisiwn [Richard] a’i gasgliadau.  Esboniwyd \nymateb y Blaid Lafur, gan gynnwys diffinio grymoedd Harri VIII ac Adran 13.2+.  \nDywedodd hefyd, o dan yr amodau mwyaf ffafriol, yn y trefniant presennol, doedd Llafur \nond yn gallu cael hanner y seddau yn y Cynulliad yn eu hetholiad diwethaf.  Roedd hi’n \ndebygol yn yr etholiad nesaf felly, y byddai’n bosibl mai Llafur fyddai’r brif blaid ond gyda \nlleiafrif o’r seddau yn unig, a’i bod yn bosibl y byddai’r pleidiau eraill yn ffurfio clymblaid i \ngadw Llafur rhag cael p ŵer. \nChris Freeguard Lgbc7m/2004 \nAr ôl cael profiad o Lywodraeth Leol yng Nghymru ac yn Lloegr, nododd fod y berthynas \nyn hollol wahanol yn y ddwy wlad, a bod yr ymagwedd partneriaeth gydweithredol yng \nNghymru yn well o lawer ar gyfer datblygu gwasanaethau lleol.  Trafododd hyfywedd y 22 \nAwdurdod presennol, a phwysleisiodd yr angen i fanteisio i’r eithaf ar adnoddau yn y \ndyfodol agos drwy ystwytho gwasanaethau cymorth a gweithio’n agosach â gwasanaethau \nlleol eraill. \n \nYn ogystal, gwelodd y canlynol fel datblygiadau i’r dyfodol agos \n(i) gosod lefel sylfaenol o wasanaethau ar gyfer awdurdodau, \n(ii) rôl arweinyddiaeth leol, \n(iii) a sut gallai’r Awdurdodau Lleol ail-rymuso democratiaeth leol. \n \nLaura McAllister \nDisgrifiodd y cefndir i Gomisiwn Richard, sut roedd yn gweithio a’i brif gasgliadau.  Gan \nfod llawer o newidiadau cyfansoddiadol yn cael eu gwneud ar hap, roedd hi’n braf cael y \ncyfle i gasglu tystiolaeth am y sefyllfa bresennol a mapio ffordd bosibl ymlaen.  Roedd yn \nadroddiad unfrydol (safbwynt un aelod wedi ei amodi mewn adroddiad wedi’i atodi) ac \nroedd hi o’r farn mai newid graddol ydoedd ac nid ymagwedd newydd radical.  Y \nweledigaeth oedd os oes gennych gynulliad, rhowch iddo’r arfau, yna esboniodd y symud o \ngynulliad i senedd a phwysigrwydd archwilio yn y broses.  Pwysleisiodd fod angen yr \naelodau ychwanegol er mwyn cyflawni’r swyddogaethau, yn enwedig archwilio, yn \nbriodol.  Nid oedd dyddiad ar yr adroddiad ac os oes problemau o ran ei weithredu ar hyn o \nbryd, roedd hi’n hyderus y byddid yn ailedrych ar ei argymhellion dros y blynyddoedd i \nddod.” \n \n12. DYDDIAD Y CYFARFOD NESAF \n \n12.1  Rhoddir gwybod am ddyddiad y cyfarfod nesaf yn nes ymlaen. \n",

When I say 'find myself', that's exactly what I mean, since in those days I didn't used to frequent such shelves. I will have been looking at the Philosophy, History, Social Science. Anyway, I see books about cricket and leaf through a few of them. They remind me of the small collection I had as a teenager - 20 titles that I can remember, and therefore (I would guess) between 20 and 30 books in all - which I left at home when I came to England in 1962. At some point my Mom will have asked me what I wanted done with them; I must have said I wasn't bothered, and she gave them to the local primary school - save for two that were autographed by famous guys: you know, Godfrey Evans, Richie Benaud, that sort of famous guys.\n\n\nLooking at the books on McGill's shelves now, 15 years later, I'm tempted to buy some. They're only a quid each, and they remind me of what I loved about cricket books as a boy: apart from the main content, the writing both good and bad, also the smell of them, the pictures, the scorecards. I hesitate - and think, no, this isn't serious stuff, it's just sport. I walk out of the shop. And then I stop. 'Bugger it, why not? Who's to say it's not serious enough?' I go back to the shelves, choose 12 of the titles there, pay for them and I'm away. \n\n\nWhen I get home WotN - or Adèle, as she then was - is just waking up from a snooze. She's slightly less than three weeks away from the birth of our second daughter. 'I've bought a few cricket books,' I tell her. Without being as interested in them as I am, she's fine with it. Within a few days I'm on my bike, touring the second-hand book shops of Manchester and Stockport. Whenever I'm in London for a meeting of the New Left Review editorial committee, I try to get some time in the Charing Cross Road.

Yet Labour and Tories agree: the state must continue to grow. Indeed, they even agree, in effect, on the rate at which that growth should take place...\n\n\nThe consensus does not stop with public-sector growth and the need to redistribute income. It goes much further. Cameron has put an end to any hope that \"patients' passports\" might provide an escape from the toils of the NHS; Letwin makes it clear that the Tories will not propose the introduction of tuition vouchers that help parents to pay for private-school tuition; the welfare of asylum seekers is to be given priority over national security - no surprise, since the Tories (only a handful shamefacedly) trooped into the lobby to deny the security services the 90-day detention period needed to gather evidence on suspected terrorists.\n\nThe list goes on. David Cameron has at the top of his priority list consensus with the Liberal Democrats, so he favours the greening of Christmas by encouraging the recycling of cards and wrapping paper; consensus with the feminist movement is to be achieved by introducing all-female lists to force local parties to choose women, rather than the candidates whom they deem most able to represent them; and consensus with New Labour is to extend to a host of \"lifestyle\" measures that, in practice, transfer to businesses and the state costs once assumed to be the responsibility of individuals.\"\n\nIn the The Telegraph Jeff Randall, business editor, is excoriating about Mr Cameron's attacks on big business:\n\"Business, especially when preceded by \"big\", will always be a convenient target for vote-starved politicians. Simply by saying the B word with the right kind of sneer on their faces, ministers can make it sound like an unsavoury activity. If all else fails (and for the Tories in the past three elections, all else did fail), tell the people that they are victims and then create culprits for them to blame. In the search for demons, successful free enterprise fits the bill nicely.  Never mind the jobs it creates, the taxes it pays, the pensions it funds, all that money-making can't be right, can it? So let's stand up to big business.  Better still, let's go the whole nine yards and stand up to big bad business. Hallelujah, brothers!\"\n\nMr Randall ends his column with strong criticism of Mr Cameron's role in the £1.2 billion OnDigital disaster.\n\n\nSimon Heffer completes today's barrage of criticism by noting the moves to the centre on education, healthcare and immigration and concludes that Mr Cameron is a follower, not a leader.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 09:05 in Right-wing press  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComments\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIs it really so 'right wing' to question the propriety of rejecting so many long-held policies and manifesto commitments?

Perhaps we could start a competition - for instance, who's going to be the first to resign from the shadow cabinet?\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael Smith |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 09:45\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nQuite so, Mike.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tSean Fear |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:27\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Mr Randall ends his column with strong criticism of Mr Cameron's role in the £1.2 billion OnDigital disaster.\"\n\n\nBoris Johnson's wrote an article for the Telegraph not long ago, which lambasted businessmen who use bancruptcy laws to pick themselves up after a fall and go on to make millions without a thought for the little people their ventures hurt.  \n\n\nI wonder if he feels this way about the directors who ran ITV Digital?  They threw a billion pounds of shareholders' money into the project -  including £100k at the PR people who designed BA's muti-ethnic tail fins to come up with 'On Digital' (which they later dropped in favour of ITV Digital - seriously devaluing the ITV brand).\n\n\nThen they liquidated the company, ruining many lower football league clubs, whom they had negociated a contract with.  Finally the liquidators, Grant Thornton, insisted the people who had been given free set-top boxes should pay £40 for them, despite the service having been cancelled.\n\n\nSurely the directors at Carlton and Granada who instigated the project shouldn't just walk away to better fortunes? \n\n\nAnd who was the Executive Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton at this time?\n\n\nDavid Cameron.\n\n\nStill, I expect consistency is beyond some people. \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:31\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWhilst some of Cameron's pronouncements might, superficially, seem to be directed towards fixing what Liam Fox identified as our \"broken society\", I can't believe that the good Doctor is entirely happy with the early signs of DC's economic 'policy'.\n\n\nDr. Fox is speaking at a Burns Supper, run by Leominster CA, on 27th January - so I'll take the opportunity to ask him.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRichard Weatherill |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:32\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Cameron will be happy to take criticism from these three  I think.

I am sure that Labour will be revisiting this area.  It's a much more fruitful seam to mine than the old stuff about Black Wednesday.\n\n\nThe crux of the Cameron strategy is to assume that you can stick two fingers up to your core vote who have nowhere else to go; and just rely on wooing the (by definition volatile) floating vote to get you over the line. To a degree, but only to a degree, this is what Blair did.  The problem for DC is that the assumptions underpinning Blair's strategy don't work for DC. The Conservative \"core\" vote is much less solid than Labour's especially as (a) a lot of them will be ushered offstage by the Grim Reaper between now and 2009; (b) there are fewer \"tribal\" Tories than \"tribal\" Labour voters; and (c) Tory heartland constituencies have lower incumbent majorities because they are bigger than their Labour equivalents. UKIP and the Lib Dems know all of this very well. I can see Cameron getting up to the high thirties but this is nowhere near good enough to oust Labour. If he makes any further headway, then Labour and the Lib Dems will do a deal on PR......at which point, to use a technical term, the Tories are well and truly f*****.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael McGowan |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:35\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nIt's fine to address issues which we have rarely addressed before if you can actually apply  good Conservative policies to them (such as domestic and international poverty).\n\n\nIt's not so fine when you junk perfectly good Conservative policies (such as the Patients' Passport, or restrictions on immigration).\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tSean Fear |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:36\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAs far as I can see DC is taking every aspect of Tory policy that the media and the other parties have used to bash Tories and changing it for the better.\n\n\nYou know what I mean tax cuts over public service investment, don't care for the environment, only care about the rich.\n\n\nHow many new voters are there going to be by the next election that will look at the old Labour party and the new fresh Tories and will make their voting decision on that not on what Thatcher did.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tsteve e |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:42\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCameron is playing for the 2009 election.

So DCs approach is to show we care about the soft issues.\n\n\nI'm happy with that but am concerned we don't lose the core conservative approach to the position of the individual and the state - recognising that while we help it's about helping people back towards self reliance, self respect, self empowerment off dependency where possible.\n\n\nIt's all down to how the policy forums enact a more positive, people friendly approach which isn't about more tax payers cash, more social engineering driven from the centre, more government .\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\t Ted |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 12:07\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSimon Heffer is right to attack Michael Gove for his pro-immigration comments.

Surely if we are to convince voters who vote Labour, Lib Dem or dont vote at all to vote Conservative we must offer them a different vision of the UK. No one is complaining that Cameron has focused on issues such as the environment or global poverty. Its the fact that he is failing to make a true free market case on these issues. Make the case for free trade, not say how free trade should be made fair. It is long overdue that the Conservatives start talking about helping the poorest in society, but 'standing up to big business' and redistribution is no way to do it. Cameron is doing some things right, but he has a long way to go before winning over the rest of us.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRob |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 12:57\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt is almost exactly seven months since we lost the last General Election.  We lost that election on a manifesto created by David Cameron, now surely he believed all that stuff he wrote?  Now only seven months later he is saying he was all wrong.  This must be the shortest political journey in history.  Or did he really not believe any of it and just wrote what he thought Michael Howard would want?  Either way it doesn't look good for David Cameron.\n\n\nThe Conservative Party was slaughtered in 1997 formally sound people took defeat badly, particularly those who lost their seats.  The best example being Michael Portillo.  They took defeat personally and asked themselves difficult questions, “why don’t they like me/us?”  They came to the simple conclusion that the Conservative Party was “nasty” and that large chunks of what happened between 1979 and 1997 were just wrong.  Other examples of this include John Bercow, former immigration secretary of the Monday Club now arch moderniser.\n\n\nFor the Conservative Party to regain power they thought we should make cosmetic changes such as ditching ties and packing the candidates list with as many minority candidates as possible by what ever means necessary.  They then set to task on policy, section 28 wrong, cutting taxes wrong, tough stance on immigration wrong and so on.  These policies should be replaced by more “voter friendly” policies such as commitment to the NHS, abolition of section 28 etc.  Now it has taken them three leaders but finally the modernisers have got there way and we are now seeing the fruits of their efforts.\n\n\nWhat really happened in 1997?  Yes we lost, but why?  Was it because we were seen as nasty and that the public really didn’t like us?  I would suggest that the public have never liked the Tory Party, their attitude to us has been “you do the job for have the price of the other lot and we can rely on you to get the job done on time, but don’t take the p*ss” Based on this notion they happily voted us in four times in a row.  Come 1997 we were well and truly taking the p*ss, Black Wednesday, brown envelopes, sex etc etc.  Faced with a reformed Labour Party they opted for similar policies with a promise not to take the p*ss.\n\n\nSo the policy wasn’t wrong it was the fact that we picked some pretty poor people to front them and these pretty poor people got up to some pretty awful things when in power.  Hence come 1997 the public give us a good kicking.\n\n\nThe scale of defeat suffered in 1997 could not be overturned in one election so come 2001 we lost. Again not down to policy, the task was just too great and if we are honest we did have a pretty poor leader.  However by 2005 we had a better leader and the policies were still broadly similar, what happened? We gained 33 seats on May 5, three in Wales and one in Scotland!  We are now the largest party in local government, with more councillors and running more councils than any other party, chairing the influential Local Government Association and we have more members than Labour and the Liberal Democrats combined, we are also the largest party in the European Parliament.  Had Michael Howard been leader since 2001 the result could have been even better.\n\n\nThe conclusion.  The policy was never wrong, we won.  Thatcherism triumphed and in 1992 Socialism in this country died.  We lost so badly in 1997 that it was going to take several elections to come back and a bl**dy good leader to do the job.  We messed around on the leader front and therefore the comeback has been slower, but it has begun and in many seats in 2005 we came close to winning.  The modernisers were wrong and will be proved wrong in 2009 when we loose again, but this time it will be the policy!\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRichard |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 13:13\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThere is no substitute for a fully thought through political philosophy. Margaret Thatcher had one: improvements to public services can only come from a successful economy; a successful economy can only be created by reducing taxes, reducing the interference of the state and librating the forces of private enterprise. It was a clear and consistent policy, articulated with cogent reasoning, and you know she believed it in her heart and tried to put it into practice in her policies. It won her three elections and even those who disagreed with her respected her for the courage of her convictions.  I voted for \n\nDavid Cameron in the recent leadership election because I felt he genuinely believed in social and economic liberalism.\n\nI felt he had the intelligence and persuasive abilities to regain the political initiative and start to set the agenda. I was heartened by his attack on Christian Aid's anti-capitalist propaganda. I was prepared to go along with his social liberalism on drugs policy and civil partnerships etc, which I do not share, because I felt that it was part of a consistent political stance. Have I misjudged him ?  I think it is too soon to say. I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill. I think what we would all be glad of is a politician who can articulate persuasively a coherent and attractive vision, and who does not seem to be at the mercy of the latest media opinion or party faction.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tjohnC |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 13:47\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTo fix the problem we need to give Cameron the heave-ho and re-run leadership elections until we get Liam Fox.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMark Fulford |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:02\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLike many commentators here, I'm slightly concerned at the direction in which Cameron is taking the party.

Certainly there were a lot of poor, inept 'spokesmen' presenting Conservative policies in the 92 to 97 government, and a lot of the trouble was just down to that. I mean, if someone like Mellor, or Selwyn-Bummer, came knocking at the door of your house, offering to sort your garden out, you wouldn't give them five seconds. And, ironically enough, it was always the least impressive people who seemed also the most arrogant and oblivious to criticism.\n\nBut personalities and policies inevitably become intertwined (and are deliberately confused by the BBC and other hostile media), so I think DC has had to make a visibly clear break with certain perceived past policies, to complete the work that the passage of time has wrought on our prominent past personalities (Lord knows why, then, he has resuscitated Gummer - that must be the most bizarre appointment of the new century). \n\nI, too, think the 'modernisers' are essentially wrong, but there are little grains of truth among the rubbish they have come out with, and DC evidently judges that the likeliest route back to power is to tack that way. It is rather like a military campaign. These early months are, I believe, essentially about winning over the media. If DC stands on a soapbox and clearly enunciates true conservative arguments, the media will, however unfairly, go on the attack, as they always do; if he tacks towards positions favoured in the media, and away from positions which are not favoured, then they will find it next to impossible to attack him, and he will become established in the centre of public life as 'a decent chap'. Having then established this secure base-camp, he will then, I should think, move on to winning over the Great British Public, in the wider world beyond the media. I appreciate that the fear is that he will by then be trapped, because of these earlier policy decisions, in useless and difficult policy terrain; but things may not be that bad. The world will by then have moved on a little bit, and unpredictable events will have intervened which may well alter the terms of public discourse, and to which DC may be able to react profitably, in getting across his message. Such transitory and unpredictable factors often make the difference between political success and failure, rather more than the possession of perfect policies at the outset.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tDeckchair of despair |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:23\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill.\"\n\n\nReading them doesn't mean Cameron understands or agreees with them!\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:39\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tI agree with JohnC on the need for clear, thought, through philosophy.\n\n\nThe problem with Thatchers approach was that the public perception was that we never got the improvements in public services - Mrs T never stood up and said \"as a result of my policies I'm now going to spend more on the NHS\" - her government did spend more but seemed ashamed to admit it. The rhetoric was that of Dracula, the talk of tax cuts rather than using the benefits of growth to improve education, to improve health, improve policing. We did all those things but message was always about controlling expenditure,  capping profligate local authorities and cutting taxes.\n\n\nAnd then under Major we got tax increases, more control of public expenditure. Can you blame to voters for saying \"we've been promised better public services... when?\" and voting for the party which said they would follow tory economic policy but deliver the improvements we'd been promising for 18 years?\n\n\nWhat's DC said thats so awful? That we need to concentrate on improving the lot of  the poor? that we need to concentrate on improving the NHS for everybody not just those (who like me) have private medical insurance? That the quality of life is important  and we should care for our environment? That he believes in a lower tax economy but not in open ended tax cuts irrespective of social needs?\n\n\nHe's changed the tone of our discourse with our electorate to show that Concervatism is about improving the lot of everyone.  I trust that when we have policies developed they will be developed from the conservative principles but their objectives must be seen to reach out to the disadvantaged, to those pushed into Labour's dependency culture as well as to the well off middle classes.\n\n\nThe article in The Scotsman shows the failure of  decades of Labour control in Glasgow - lower life expectancy, high social damage. We need to show we can deal with those failures.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\t Ted |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:47\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill.\"\n\n\nAs part of my degree I had to read works by the likes of Marx, Lenin, Engels and Chomsky.

First, I don't know whether some of the forgetfulness is down to the aforementioned grim reaper preparing for collections, but are we not forgetting that Labour moved considerably to the right to get elected. The point of Cameron is that he is not moving even further to the right 'just to be different'. He is fighting off Labour in the centre, who will then lurk to the left, leaving us lots of room for policies like the 'Patients Passport' in years to come. Politics is about the long haul now, not quick fixes; look what has happened to us over the last few elections. This is what Cameron and the younger generation like myself see. We need room to breathe. Forming right-wing policies in the current climate will not get us elected whilst Labour has the centre ground. Cameron is assuming (wrongly it seems) that the so-called 'core vote' is intelligent enough to understand this process.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMatthew |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 15:38\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe problem, Matthew, is that we have been here before and look what that led to?  The Butskellites' \"great idea\" was to position themselves one cigarette paper to the right of Labour and then fall back on good old-fashioned deference to get out the vote. They were always implying that they would do great things which surprise surprise never came to pass. Those other great scions of Eton and Oxford, Eden and MacMillan, plus Ted Heath, simply helped the Labour Party bed down the post-war consensus that social justice = collectivised mediocrity. At least the Butskellites could fall back on deference and the figurehead of Winston Churchill. He is well and truly dead and the deference has now, thankfully, gone. There is no longer a role for another left-leaning party which is anti-meritocratic, protects vested social interests and has only a lukewarm enthusiasm for liberal economics. If you want that cocktail, Labour and the Lib Dems already provide poverty of aspiration by the boatload.  \n\n\nTo pick up a point made by Malcolm earlier, it is not my views on Cameron's tenure at Carlton which ultimately matter. It is what the public and Labour will make of them and it is not a very happy tale. Add to that the fact that his spin doctor role at Carlton was Cameron's ONLY position of responsibility outside the closed incestuous world of Tory politics at Westminster. \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael McGowan |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 16:04\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFair point, however there is a difference.

The political differences between Blair and Brown are actually rather small (remember that Brown is the co-architect of New Labour). The only real differences are that Brown sees less scope for subscontracting to the private sector.\n\n\nAnd as for this Labour has moved to the right nonsense, giving up nationalising the means of production and distribution does not mean they have moved in other areas!  \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 16:30\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Nice to see Simple Simon up to his usual tricks again. What made me laugh was the opening to his article along the lines of 'people are expecting me to rant about Cameron and co, but their antics are not worthy of any comment from an intellectual god like myself', which was followed by the rest of his article, which was, quelle surprise, a rant about Cameron and co. Classic.\"\n\n\nI'm sorry, Daniel, but Heffer is just not that stupid (though it is convenient for you to pretend he is). \n\n\nIf you would like me to translate what he was saying...\n\n\nCameron expects the likes of Heffer to respond with bile at every pronouncement he makes, i.e. to take them at face value and scream at the abandonment of traditional conservative policies. \n\n\nInstead, Heffer is looking at the bigger picture -- the tactic Cameron is pursuing -- of *wanting* the likes of Heffer to scream at each policy announcement, each vacuous Labour-lite statement. \n\n\nIn other words, he is *not* taking Cameron's pronouncements at face value as indications of where Cameron is going, but is responding to Cameron's overall tactical approach.\n\n\nDo you get it?\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJohn Hustings |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 17:02\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tI read somewhere that Norman Lamont, DC's former boss, doesn't think that DC's political direction is fully formed.

Not bad for a month. So this is not the time for us members to start laying into him.\n\n\nBut articles by commentators like Stelzer, Randall and Heffer are v helpful in drip-drip-dripping on public consciousness.

Roedd mam Iesu yno, 2 ac roedd Iesu a'i ddisgyblion wedi derbyn y gwahoddiad i'r briodas hefyd.  3 Pan doedd dim gwin ar ôl, dyma fam Iesu’n dweud wrtho, \"Does ganddyn nhw ddim mwy o win.\" \n\n 4 Atebodd Iesu, \"Mam annwyl, gad lonydd i mi.  Dydy e ddim o'n busnes ni.  Dydy fy amser i ddim wedi dod eto.\" \n\n 5 Ond dwedodd ei fam wrth y gweision, \"Gwnewch beth bynnag fydd yn ei ddweud wrthoch chi.\" \n\n 6 Roedd chwech ystên garreg wrth ymyl (y math sy'n cael eu defnyddio gan yr Iddewon i ddal dŵr ar gyfer y ddefod o ymolchi seremonïol). Roedd pob un ohonyn nhw’n dal rhwng wyth deg a chant dau ddeg litr. \n\n 7 Dwedodd Iesu wrth y gweision, \"Llanwch yr ystenau yma gyda dŵr.\"  Felly dyma nhw'n eu llenwi i'r top. \n\n 8 Yna dwedodd wrthyn nhw, \"Cymerwch beth ohono a mynd ag e i lywydd y wledd.\" \n\nDyma nhw’n gwneud hynny,  9 a dyma llywydd y wledd yn blasu'r dŵr oedd wedi ei droi'n win.  Doedd ganddo ddim syniad o ble roedd wedi dod (ond roedd y gweision oedd wedi codi'r dŵr yn gwybod).  Yna galwodd y priodfab ato 10 ac meddai wrtho, \"Mae pobl fel arfer yn dod â'r gwin gorau allan gyntaf a'r gwin rhad yn nes ymlaen ar ôl i'r gwesteion gael gormod i'w yfed. Pam wyt ti wedi cadw'r gorau i’r diwedd?\" \n\n 11 Y wyrth hon yn Cana Galilea oedd y gyntaf wnaeth Iesu fel arwydd o pwy oedd.  Roedd yn dangos ei ysblander, a dyma’i ddisgyblion yn credu ynddo. \n\n 12 Ar ôl y briodas aeth Iesu i lawr i Capernaum gyda'i fam a'i frodyr a'i ddisgyblion, ac aros yno am ychydig ddyddiau.\n\n\n\nIesu'n clirio'r Deml\n\n\n\n 13 Roedd yn amser Gŵyl y Pasg (un o wyliau’r Iddewon), a dyma Iesu’n mynd i Jerwsalem.  14 Yng nghwrt y deml gwelodd bobl yn gwerthu ychen, defaid a colomennod, ac eraill yn eistedd wrth fyrddau yn cyfnewid arian.  15 Felly gwnaeth chwip o reffynnau, a’u gyrru nhw i gyd allan o'r deml gyda’r defaid a'r ychen.  Chwalodd holl arian y rhai oedd yn cyfnewid arian, a throi eu byrddau drosodd.  16 Yna meddai wrth y rhai oedd yn gwerthu colomennod \"Ewch â'r rhain allan oddi yma!  Stopiwch droi tŷ fy Nhad i yn farchnad!\" \n\n 17 Yna cofiodd ei ddisgyblion fod yr ysgrifau sanctaidd yn dweud: \"Bydd fy sêl dros dy dŷ di yn fy meddiannu i.\"\n\n 18 Ond dyma'r arweinwyr Iddewig yn ei herio,  \"Pa arwydd gwyrthiol wnei di i brofi i ni fod gen ti hawl i wneud hyn i gyd?\" \n\n 19 Atebodd Iesu nhw, \"Dinistriwch y deml hon, a gwna i ei hadeiladu hi eto o fewn tri diwrnod.\" \n\n 20 Atebodd yr arweinwyr Iddewig, \"Mae’r deml wedi bod yn cael ei hadeiladu ers pedwar deg chwech mlynedd!  Wyt ti'n mynd i'w hadeiladu mewn tri diwrnod?\"  21 (Ond y deml oedd Iesu'n sôn amdani oedd ei gorff.  22 Ar ôl i Iesu ddod yn ôl yn fyw, cofiodd ei ddisgyblion ei fod wedi dweud hyn, a dyma nhw'n credu'r ysgrifau sanctaidd a beth ddwedodd Iesu.) \n\n 23 Tra roedd Iesu yn Jerwsalem yn ystod Gŵyl y Pasg, daeth llawer o bobl i gredu ynddo am eu bod nhw wedi ei weld e'n gwneud arwyddion gwyrthiol.  24 Ond doedd Iesu ddim yn eu trystio nhw - roedd e'n deall pobl i’r dim.  25 Doedd dim angen neb i esbonio iddo, am ei fod e'n gwybod yn iawn sut mae’r meddwl dynol yn gweithio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawlfraint © Gobaith i Gymru 2008, ar ran y Golygydd.

They're raising some money which they'd like to donate to a worthwhile kidney research related cause, and they're interested in ideas anyone might have about where they might best direct it.

It is an umbrella organisation representing women and women's organisations in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to ensure women's views are taken into account by the government and are heard in public debate.\nThe WNC is based alongside the Government Equalities Office, which was formed from the Women and Equality unit established in 1997 as the Women's Unit, to support the Ministers for Women.\nThe WNC is an advisory Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB), meaning it is fully funded by government but able to comment freely on government policy. In its unique role, the WNC liaises with, and is consulted by, the Government Equalities Office, as well as other government departments.\nBaroness Anita Gale, speaking at an event in Cardiff, outlined the role and structure of the WNC.

So please keep a large bag of salt handy and be prepared to read between the lines!\n\n\nIf you disagree with a comment, or information is out of date, please submit an update! The contributors come from all walks of life, and their opinions are bound to be subjective, so if your view isn't represented, please speak up and contribute to the balance of the Guide. See below in the 'Have Your Say' section for how to add your voice.\n\n\n\n \nHave Your Say...\n\nThe Knowhere Guide depends entirely on real users for information. Please feel free to join in. \nYou can tell us more about Frinton. \nThis is also the method to use if you want to correct some of the information already here. \n(But please remember you're not mailing the person who actually wrote whatever-it-is.) \n\n\nYou can use the add an event form to tell us about events happening in Frinton.\n\n\nIf you are unhappy with any of the content on this page, turn on the flags.\n\n\nOr, if you'd just like to leave a message for other users of this site, take a look at The Knowhere Board (handy if you're just trying to get in touch with someone). \n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nAll the information in the Knowhere Guide has been contributed by users over the years.

\nThe boom in house prices over the past ten years has fuelled an unprecedented demand  \n  \nfor social housing, with 1.6 million households now on the waiting list in England,  \n \nrepresenting an estimated 4 million people, or 1 person in 13.  \n \n \n \nThe unexpected severity of the global credit crunch and the real possibility of a housing  \n \ncrash has prompted serious concerns that demand for social housing will exceed all \n \nexpectations and could reach 2 million households by 2010, or one in ten people.  \n \n \n \nCouncils are already struggling to cope and are calling for a review of existing government  \n \npolicy to give local government greater freedom to invest in house-building. \n \n \nThis report briefly outlines the challenges posed by the credit crunch by examining the \nnature of previous recessions and the impact on the housing market. It also identifies the \nrisks and issues that will be presented to local government over the coming months as \nmortgage lenders continue to tighten their lending criteria, house prices drop and what \nhappens if repossessions start to gain pace. \n \nThe report also examines the effect on new build of affordable property, as developers \nrecognise the slowdown in demand for new developments, which in turn, will restrict the \nnumber of new affordable homes being built. It also looks at the difficulty housing \nassociations and other Registered Social Landlords could have when seeking out new lines \n3 of credit or borrowing facilities as they, just like individual homeowners or potential \nhomeowners, see increasing restrictions placed on the amount they can borrow. \n \nWhen the credit crunch began last August, many policy-makers believed that the \ndisruption to financial markets was likely to be short-lived and have only a small effect on \nthe housing market and the wider economy.  \n \nNow it is becoming clear that the credit crunch is likely to last longer, hit economic growth \nmore deeply and spread more widely than previously believed.  \n \nThe housing market is already showing signs of being seriously affected. House prices have \nrecorded their first year-on-year  fall for 12 years and new mortgage approvals have fallen \nto their lowest level since records began in 1990. Persimmon, Britain’s biggest house \nbuilder, has shelved the building of new homes until the mortgage market improves. And \nsubstantial house price falls are now being predicted, leading to large numbers of people \nfacing the prospect of negative equity and repossessions. \n  \nCash-strapped banks have been bailed out to the tune of £50 billion, prompting Mervyn \nKing, the Governor of the Bank of England, to warn them to learn from their mistakes and \nnot to return to the “hubris and excessive lending” seen in the run up to the credit \nsqueeze.  The days of 100 per cent lending and risk-taking may be over, but consumers \nhave yet to see the £50 billion filter down to mean lower borrowing rates for potential \nhomeowners. \n \n \n \n \n \n4  \n \n \n \n \nSummary \n \nThe impacts of a housing crash are in short:  \n \n• lower consumer confidence  \n \n• precautionary saving \n \n• curtailed ability to borrow \n \n• finance for property development harder to source  \n \n• lenders face losses  \n \n• weaker economic environment \n \n• higher unemployment \n  \n• slowdown in the economy \n  \n• increase in bankruptcies and individual voluntary agreements and mortgage \nrepossessions \n \n• increased demand on rental property \n  \n• lack of confidence in long-term investments \n \n• negative equity \n \n• potential reduction in private sector house building and land value \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Potential impacts for local government : \n \n• Debt – a number of individuals could end up in debt, and therefore fail to pay \ncouncil tax. People in debt may also seek advice, as directed by the FSA  \n \n• Labour market – there could be an increase in those turning to benefits as they \ncan’t find work \n \n• Housing – individuals found homeless could be in need of social housing \n \n• Equity – many retired people will rely on the equity of the house as provision for \ncare/care homes.  If this decreases, this may place more demand on social care \nservices.  This may also impact take up of benefits, and state pension provision \n \n• Housing stock – the number of homes built by the private sector may fall, thus \naffecting house building targets and putting pressure on social housing provision.  \nThere could also be a drop in land value, potentially allowing housing associations \nto acquire land more cheaply. \n \n \n \nQuestion \n \nThis paper is designed to discuss some of the issues that could arise for local authorities \nshould there be a housing crash. \n \n6  \n \n \n \nMethod \n \nA number of sources were covered including academic papers, JRF papers, and advice web \npages for home owners and buyers. \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n1\nThe JRF  (2007) comment that “In the past, local authorities’ assessments of housing \nmarkets rarely went beyond rather formulaic exercises calculating the ‘backlog’ of demand \nand future trends in the need for housing outside private provision. More sophisticated \nappraisals are now necessary” \n \nThe research question above has two complexities, firstly the complexity of the housing \nmarket and all those factors linked into the system.  Secondly the affects of a housing \ncrash are unlikely to be universal but vary across the county and vary dependent on \ngeography (sub regional, district and neighbourhood levels).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 A summary of the housing market system is found in Williams and Holman’s (1997) book:  \n \n \n \n2\nBefore analysing the implications of a housing crash it is important to understand :  \n \n• The housing market is multi-layered – different factors influence demand at sub-\nregional, district and neighbourhood levels. \n \n• Patterns of investment vary increasingly from one area to the next, due to different \narrangements for stock-transfer and arm’s-length-management. \n \n• ‘Spill-over effects’ from one tenure to another, e.g. affordability pressures in owner-\noccupation can have an impact on the demand for social or private rented housing. \n \n• Housing needs and housing aspirations are different things and need to be \nrecognised accordingly.  \n \n \n8 A housing market crash will affect different people in different ways, and will therefore \n3\nhave different implications for local government.  The JRF in its paper   “Understanding \nand responding to housing market change” (May 2007) classifies households into 9 \ngroups: \n \n• Students – investment in purpose-build accommodation and renting. \n \n• Recent graduates – quality of place factors, not housing, will be a concern for \nretaining recent graduates. \n \n• New urbanists – not economic reasons, but wishing to be close to the “buzz” of \nthe city. \n \n• Long-distance movers – often retired, semi-retired or home workers, less concerned \nabout the quality of the properties but more about transport links. \n \n• International economic in-migrants – not well understood, but can be single men, \noften clubbing together to form households. \n \n• Established minority ethnic communities – emerging generation produces high rates \nof household formation and therefore pressure on already densely populated areas. \n \n• Family builders – priority is placed on relative affordability, and the quality of local \nschools is likely to be a strong influence. They will often move to small market \ntowns or suburbs.  \n \n9 • Empty nesters - groups moving for the benefits of owning property to fund \nretirement or children through higher education etc. \n \n• The asset- and income-poor – this group are most vulnerable to market fragility, \nhave least opportunity to seek other options and are most likely to be pushed into \nmore concentrated areas if affordability problems elsewhere bring new pressures on \nareas where prices have previously been low.  \n \nThe current housing market context \n \n4\nAccording to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors  accessibility and affordability are \nboth worsening.  \n \nAn accessibility index (calculated by looking at the up-front costs of purchasing a home as \ncompared to combined take-home pay), developed by RICS has found that the cost of \nbecoming a home purchaser in Great Britain has worsened by 351% since the most \naccessible point in 1996, after hitting a high of over 500% in 2005.  \n \nThey comment that “a first-time buyer couple, both on lower quartile earnings (totalling \n£26,595 after taxes), will now have to save up to the equivalent of 104% of joint take-\nhome pay, to build up the £27,729 needed for up front buying costs on a typical home \nincluding the deposit, fees and stamp duty. This equates to a substantial rise from the low \npoint of 23% required in 1996.”  However, it is important to note that the current first \ntime buyer cohort may have access to family wealth, which may not always be the case.  \n \n10 The RICS attribute the worsening in accessibility to rising costs of buying a home, stamp \nduty and slight reductions in loan-to-value ratios that lenders have been offering first time \nbuyers. \n \nThe article also highlights problems with affordability (calculated by looking at mortgage \ninterest payments compared to combined take-home pay).  They state “a couple on lower \nquartile income now has to spend 40.3% (down slightly from 40.8% in Q3 2007) of their \ncombined take-home pay to service their mortgage, 8% below the all time high of 47.8% \nin Q1 1990.” Whilst there appears to be a slight improvement, attributable to stable \ninterest rates in Q4 and rising earnings, the trend is still generally of worsening \naffordability.  This is particularly the case in London and the South East. The RICS comment \nthat in London, the South East and the South West a couple would have to save 100% of \ntheir combined take-home pay to be able to afford a property, and in London a first-time \nbuyer household would be likely to spend 51% of their after-tax income  on mortgage \npayments compared to 29% in the North East.  \n \nIn addition to worsening affordability and accessibility, the RICS comment that \nrepossession levels are also likely to rise estimating that “123 houses will be repossessed \n 5\nper day in 2008.”  \n \n \nThe 1990s housing crash \n \n6\nA recent paper by the GLA  considers the differences between the current economic \nclimate and that of the early 1990s and the 1970s.  They comment that “Historically, \nsudden drops in house prices have only occurred in an environment of rapidly rising \n11 unemployment and/or interest rates, as for example in the early 1990s. Current \nemployment forecasts for London and the UK do not suggest rapidly rising unemployment, \nand an interest rate trigger is absent. A house price crash therefore seems less likely than \nin the early 1990s.” \n \nThe following table from this GLA paper summarises the changing economic picture: \n \n

 provides an overview of what could happen to both \nindustry and individuals should there be a drop in residential and/or commercial property \nprices.   \n \nThe FSA reports that housing assets constitute about 45% of personal wealth in the UK, \nwhich means a sharp fall in house prices could have a number of knock-on effects.  For the \nindividual, household spending could be vulnerable to changes in house prices.  A fall may \nlead to a drop in consumer confidence, reduced spending and an increase in precautionary \nsaving.  If happening quickly, all three impacts could lead to increased unemployment and \na slow down in the economy. \n \nIn the short-term there could also be an impact on individuals’ ability to borrow against the \nvalue of their homes.    Lenders would be likely to reduce the percentage of the value that \nthey are prepared to lend in order to mitigate this risk.  A combination of reduced \nspending, slower economic growth and a weaker labour market could increase the \nnumbers of individuals facing financial hardship and falling into debt.  This is particularly \nproblematic if individuals cannot consolidate debts through further borrowing against their \nproperty. This could result in personal bankruptcies or individual voluntary arrangements \n(IVAs) and increased mortgage repossessions. \n13  \nThe affects above (pressure on house prices, tighter credit conditions, lower consumer \nconfidence and high levels of personal debt) could lead to a decline in both demand and \nsupply of mortgages, thus affecting the mortgage intermediary industry. \n \nThe FSA warn that a lack of confidence in long-term investments and pensions (following \nmis-selling cases of both personal pensions and mortgage endowments) at a time of \nrapidly rising house prices has caused some individuals to forego investment in a pension \nin favour of relying on the increase in equity in their homes for their long-term financial \nprovision, therefore storing up a potential problem should equity drop.   \n \nIn addition to impacts on individuals, a drop in property prices will have wider impacts.  A \nfall in commercial property could mean that finance for property developments or \nsecuritisation deals become increasingly difficult to obtain.  For financial firms with a large \nreliance on this type of lending there could be a significant impact on profits. As values in \nproperty decrease and the economic outlook deteriorates equity markets could come \nunder pressure, impacting upon the life-insurance industry and other financial service \nsectors.  A fall in investor confidence could also result in commercial property-backed \ninvestment funds being forced to sell properties to maintain liquidity. The FSA warn that \nfurther restrictions on withdrawals by consumers could lead to a further drop in \nconfidence and slow down of the economy.  \n \n9\nAn article in Housing Market  (August 2007) comments that if house prices fall sharply \nthen a rush by weak buy-to-let investors to cut losses could hasten the decline in UK house \nprices during 2008. It also makes the point that a credit crunch can suppress bonuses and \n14 thus lead to a depression of London house prices and send a negative ripple through the \nwhole UK housing market.  \n \nIndividuals \n \n10\nDorling and Cornford  looked at how house price falls in 1993 affected different groups  \nof homebuyers by examining the distribution of negative equity between different  \n \ncategories of borrowers in Britain by the third quarter of 1993. The major findings are:  \n \n \n• negative equity was disproportionately held by borrowers with properties in the \nSouth East (although there are very significant micro-spatial variations).  \n \n• only in the northern regions of Britain were people with mortgage advances of \nmore than 90% of purchase price unlikely to have negative equity. \n \n• negative equity was disproportionately held by those who purchased their property \nbetween 1988 and 1991. \n  \n• negative equity is disproportionately held by those on lower incomes. \n  \n• negative equity is disproportionately held by younger borrowers. In every region it is \nborrowers who were under 25 at the time of purchase who held the largest \nproportions of negative equity in 1993. \n  \n• Negative equity is disproportionately held by those who purchased properties at the \nlower end of the market (in every region it was 1988-91 borrowers whose property \nwas purchased for less than £40 000 who were most likely to have negative equity).  \n15  \n• Negative equity was disproportionately held by borrowers whose occupations at the \ntime of purchase were in clerical or manual work. Some of the implications of these \nfindings are discussed.  \n \n \nHouse building \n \n11\nA recent paper by the GLA  comments that if there is a drop in house prices, homes in the  \nplanning pipeline may slow down and this could affect whether housing targets (i.e. the  \nGB target of 3 million new homes by 2020) are met. They expect in the short term that \nnew starts levels in 2008 will be lower than 2007, although homes currently under \nconstruction will complete.   \n \nDevelopers’ sales expectations have declined recently.  “For virtually the whole of the past \ndecade house price growth substantially exceeded growth in building costs. In contrast, if \nhouse price growth slows, it may only match the rate of increase in build costs over the \nnext five years. The tightening in supply of new build homes will be exacerbated if input \ncosts (including labour, plant and materials) begin to increase more rapidly than in the past \n(for example, if imported materials become more expensive on the back of a falling \npound).”  This could in turn affect land values.   \n \nThe 1990s house crash led to both a decrease in private sector house building and land \nvalue. The number of permanent private enterprise completed dwellings fell from a peak in \n12\n1988 of 176, 018 to 116,634 in 1993 before increasing again .  The land price index \n13\n(where 1985=100) fell from 216 in 1990 to 169 in 1993, before increasing again . \n \n \n16  \nLocal government \n \nThe JRF comment that there is a limit to how local government can influence the housing \nmarket. Formerly the council was “landlord, investor, allocater,  manager, rent setter and \nin many cases developer”.  \n                        \n• Debt – a number of individuals could end up in debt, and therefore fail to pay \ncouncil tax. People in debt may also seek advice, as directed by the FSA.  \n \n• Labour market – there could be an increase in those turning to benefits as they \ncan’t find work. \n \n• Housing – individuals found homeless could be in need of social housing. \n \n• Equity – many retired people will rely on the equity of the house as provision for \ncare/care homes.  If this decreases, this may place more demand on social care \nservices.  This may also impact take up of benefits, and state pension provision. \n \n• Housing stock – the number of homes built by the private sector may fall, thus \naffecting house building targets and putting pressure on social housing provision.  \nThere could also be a drop in land value, potentially allowing housing associations \nto acquire land more cheaply. \n \n \n \n17  \nLGA Heads of Housing Survey \n \nAn LGA Heads of Housing Survey found that 80 per cent of councils reported an increase \nin demand for social housing in the last two years, with 66 per cent blaming the high level \nof house prices. Nearly half  (47 per cent) said their current allocations policy is not coping \nwith the increase.  \n \nLack of housing stock was named as the biggest challenge.           \n                                                 \nBibliography

Yet Labour and Tories agree: the state must continue to grow. Indeed, they even agree, in effect, on the rate at which that growth should take place...\n\n\nThe consensus does not stop with public-sector growth and the need to redistribute income. It goes much further. Cameron has put an end to any hope that \"patients' passports\" might provide an escape from the toils of the NHS; Letwin makes it clear that the Tories will not propose the introduction of tuition vouchers that help parents to pay for private-school tuition; the welfare of asylum seekers is to be given priority over national security - no surprise, since the Tories (only a handful shamefacedly) trooped into the lobby to deny the security services the 90-day detention period needed to gather evidence on suspected terrorists.\n\nThe list goes on. David Cameron has at the top of his priority list consensus with the Liberal Democrats, so he favours the greening of Christmas by encouraging the recycling of cards and wrapping paper; consensus with the feminist movement is to be achieved by introducing all-female lists to force local parties to choose women, rather than the candidates whom they deem most able to represent them; and consensus with New Labour is to extend to a host of \"lifestyle\" measures that, in practice, transfer to businesses and the state costs once assumed to be the responsibility of individuals.\"\n\nIn the The Telegraph Jeff Randall, business editor, is excoriating about Mr Cameron's attacks on big business:\n\"Business, especially when preceded by \"big\", will always be a convenient target for vote-starved politicians. Simply by saying the B word with the right kind of sneer on their faces, ministers can make it sound like an unsavoury activity. If all else fails (and for the Tories in the past three elections, all else did fail), tell the people that they are victims and then create culprits for them to blame. In the search for demons, successful free enterprise fits the bill nicely.  Never mind the jobs it creates, the taxes it pays, the pensions it funds, all that money-making can't be right, can it? So let's stand up to big business.  Better still, let's go the whole nine yards and stand up to big bad business. Hallelujah, brothers!\"\n\nMr Randall ends his column with strong criticism of Mr Cameron's role in the £1.2 billion OnDigital disaster.\n\n\nSimon Heffer completes today's barrage of criticism by noting the moves to the centre on education, healthcare and immigration and concludes that Mr Cameron is a follower, not a leader.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 09:05 in Right-wing press  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComments\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIs it really so 'right wing' to question the propriety of rejecting so many long-held policies and manifesto commitments? Or is it just, well, Conservative?\n\n\nI'm surprised that - unless I've missed it, which  is possible - no member of the parliamentary party has yet had the courage to speak up against Cameron's odder notions. Perhaps we could start a competition - for instance, who's going to be the first to resign from the shadow cabinet?\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael Smith |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 09:45\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nQuite so, Mike.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tSean Fear |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:27\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Mr Randall ends his column with strong criticism of Mr Cameron's role in the £1.2 billion OnDigital disaster.\"\n\n\nBoris Johnson's wrote an article for the Telegraph not long ago, which lambasted businessmen who use bancruptcy laws to pick themselves up after a fall and go on to make millions without a thought for the little people their ventures hurt.  \n\n\nI wonder if he feels this way about the directors who ran ITV Digital?  They threw a billion pounds of shareholders' money into the project -  including £100k at the PR people who designed BA's muti-ethnic tail fins to come up with 'On Digital' (which they later dropped in favour of ITV Digital - seriously devaluing the ITV brand).\n\n\nThen they liquidated the company, ruining many lower football league clubs, whom they had negociated a contract with.  Finally the liquidators, Grant Thornton, insisted the people who had been given free set-top boxes should pay £40 for them, despite the service having been cancelled.\n\n\nSurely the directors at Carlton and Granada who instigated the project shouldn't just walk away to better fortunes? \n\n\nAnd who was the Executive Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton at this time?\n\n\nDavid Cameron.\n\n\nStill, I expect consistency is beyond some people. \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:31\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWhilst some of Cameron's pronouncements might, superficially, seem to be directed towards fixing what Liam Fox identified as our \"broken society\", I can't believe that the good Doctor is entirely happy with the early signs of DC's economic 'policy'.\n\n\nDr. Fox is speaking at a Burns Supper, run by Leominster CA, on 27th January - so I'll take the opportunity to ask him.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRichard Weatherill |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 10:32\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Cameron will be happy to take criticism from these three  I think.

I am sure that Labour will be revisiting this area.  It's a much more fruitful seam to mine than the old stuff about Black Wednesday.\n\n\nThe crux of the Cameron strategy is to assume that you can stick two fingers up to your core vote who have nowhere else to go; and just rely on wooing the (by definition volatile) floating vote to get you over the line. To a degree, but only to a degree, this is what Blair did.  The problem for DC is that the assumptions underpinning Blair's strategy don't work for DC. The Conservative \"core\" vote is much less solid than Labour's especially as (a) a lot of them will be ushered offstage by the Grim Reaper between now and 2009; (b) there are fewer \"tribal\" Tories than \"tribal\" Labour voters; and (c) Tory heartland constituencies have lower incumbent majorities because they are bigger than their Labour equivalents. UKIP and the Lib Dems know all of this very well. I can see Cameron getting up to the high thirties but this is nowhere near good enough to oust Labour. If he makes any further headway, then Labour and the Lib Dems will do a deal on PR......at which point, to use a technical term, the Tories are well and truly f*****.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael McGowan |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:35\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nIt's fine to address issues which we have rarely addressed before if you can actually apply  good Conservative policies to them (such as domestic and international poverty).\n\n\nIt's not so fine when you junk perfectly good Conservative policies (such as the Patients' Passport, or restrictions on immigration).\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tSean Fear |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:36\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAs far as I can see DC is taking every aspect of Tory policy that the media and the other parties have used to bash Tories and changing it for the better.\n\n\nYou know what I mean tax cuts over public service investment, don't care for the environment, only care about the rich.\n\n\nHow many new voters are there going to be by the next election that will look at the old Labour party and the new fresh Tories and will make their voting decision on that not on what Thatcher did.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tsteve e |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 11:42\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCameron is playing for the 2009 election.

So DCs approach is to show we care about the soft issues.\n\n\nI'm happy with that but am concerned we don't lose the core conservative approach to the position of the individual and the state - recognising that while we help it's about helping people back towards self reliance, self respect, self empowerment off dependency where possible.\n\n\nIt's all down to how the policy forums enact a more positive, people friendly approach which isn't about more tax payers cash, more social engineering driven from the centre, more government .\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\t Ted |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 12:07\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSimon Heffer is right to attack Michael Gove for his pro-immigration comments.

Surely if we are to convince voters who vote Labour, Lib Dem or dont vote at all to vote Conservative we must offer them a different vision of the UK. No one is complaining that Cameron has focused on issues such as the environment or global poverty. Its the fact that he is failing to make a true free market case on these issues. Make the case for free trade, not say how free trade should be made fair. It is long overdue that the Conservatives start talking about helping the poorest in society, but 'standing up to big business' and redistribution is no way to do it. Cameron is doing some things right, but he has a long way to go before winning over the rest of us.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRob |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 12:57\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt is almost exactly seven months since we lost the last General Election.  We lost that election on a manifesto created by David Cameron, now surely he believed all that stuff he wrote?  Now only seven months later he is saying he was all wrong.  This must be the shortest political journey in history.  Or did he really not believe any of it and just wrote what he thought Michael Howard would want?  Either way it doesn't look good for David Cameron.\n\n\nThe Conservative Party was slaughtered in 1997 formally sound people took defeat badly, particularly those who lost their seats.  The best example being Michael Portillo.  They took defeat personally and asked themselves difficult questions, “why don’t they like me/us?”  They came to the simple conclusion that the Conservative Party was “nasty” and that large chunks of what happened between 1979 and 1997 were just wrong.  Other examples of this include John Bercow, former immigration secretary of the Monday Club now arch moderniser.\n\n\nFor the Conservative Party to regain power they thought we should make cosmetic changes such as ditching ties and packing the candidates list with as many minority candidates as possible by what ever means necessary.  They then set to task on policy, section 28 wrong, cutting taxes wrong, tough stance on immigration wrong and so on.  These policies should be replaced by more “voter friendly” policies such as commitment to the NHS, abolition of section 28 etc.  Now it has taken them three leaders but finally the modernisers have got there way and we are now seeing the fruits of their efforts.\n\n\nWhat really happened in 1997?  Yes we lost, but why?  Was it because we were seen as nasty and that the public really didn’t like us?  I would suggest that the public have never liked the Tory Party, their attitude to us has been “you do the job for have the price of the other lot and we can rely on you to get the job done on time, but don’t take the p*ss” Based on this notion they happily voted us in four times in a row.  Come 1997 we were well and truly taking the p*ss, Black Wednesday, brown envelopes, sex etc etc.  Faced with a reformed Labour Party they opted for similar policies with a promise not to take the p*ss.\n\n\nSo the policy wasn’t wrong it was the fact that we picked some pretty poor people to front them and these pretty poor people got up to some pretty awful things when in power.  Hence come 1997 the public give us a good kicking.\n\n\nThe scale of defeat suffered in 1997 could not be overturned in one election so come 2001 we lost. Again not down to policy, the task was just too great and if we are honest we did have a pretty poor leader.  However by 2005 we had a better leader and the policies were still broadly similar, what happened? We gained 33 seats on May 5, three in Wales and one in Scotland!  We are now the largest party in local government, with more councillors and running more councils than any other party, chairing the influential Local Government Association and we have more members than Labour and the Liberal Democrats combined, we are also the largest party in the European Parliament.  Had Michael Howard been leader since 2001 the result could have been even better.\n\n\nThe conclusion.  The policy was never wrong, we won.  Thatcherism triumphed and in 1992 Socialism in this country died.  We lost so badly in 1997 that it was going to take several elections to come back and a bl**dy good leader to do the job.  We messed around on the leader front and therefore the comeback has been slower, but it has begun and in many seats in 2005 we came close to winning.  The modernisers were wrong and will be proved wrong in 2009 when we loose again, but this time it will be the policy!\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tRichard |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 13:13\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThere is no substitute for a fully thought through political philosophy. Margaret Thatcher had one: improvements to public services can only come from a successful economy; a successful economy can only be created by reducing taxes, reducing the interference of the state and librating the forces of private enterprise. It was a clear and consistent policy, articulated with cogent reasoning, and you know she believed it in her heart and tried to put it into practice in her policies. It won her three elections and even those who disagreed with her respected her for the courage of her convictions.  I voted for \n\nDavid Cameron in the recent leadership election because I felt he genuinely believed in social and economic liberalism.\n\nI felt he had the intelligence and persuasive abilities to regain the political initiative and start to set the agenda. I was heartened by his attack on Christian Aid's anti-capitalist propaganda. I was prepared to go along with his social liberalism on drugs policy and civil partnerships etc, which I do not share, because I felt that it was part of a consistent political stance. Have I misjudged him ?  I think it is too soon to say. I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill. I think what we would all be glad of is a politician who can articulate persuasively a coherent and attractive vision, and who does not seem to be at the mercy of the latest media opinion or party faction.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tjohnC |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 13:47\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTo fix the problem we need to give Cameron the heave-ho and re-run leadership elections until we get Liam Fox.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMark Fulford |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:02\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLike many commentators here, I'm slightly concerned at the direction in which Cameron is taking the party.

I mean, if someone like Mellor, or Selwyn-Bummer, came knocking at the door of your house, offering to sort your garden out, you wouldn't give them five seconds. And, ironically enough, it was always the least impressive people who seemed also the most arrogant and oblivious to criticism.\n\nBut personalities and policies inevitably become intertwined (and are deliberately confused by the BBC and other hostile media), so I think DC has had to make a visibly clear break with certain perceived past policies, to complete the work that the passage of time has wrought on our prominent past personalities (Lord knows why, then, he has resuscitated Gummer - that must be the most bizarre appointment of the new century). \n\nI, too, think the 'modernisers' are essentially wrong, but there are little grains of truth among the rubbish they have come out with, and DC evidently judges that the likeliest route back to power is to tack that way. It is rather like a military campaign. These early months are, I believe, essentially about winning over the media. If DC stands on a soapbox and clearly enunciates true conservative arguments, the media will, however unfairly, go on the attack, as they always do; if he tacks towards positions favoured in the media, and away from positions which are not favoured, then they will find it next to impossible to attack him, and he will become established in the centre of public life as 'a decent chap'. Having then established this secure base-camp, he will then, I should think, move on to winning over the Great British Public, in the wider world beyond the media. I appreciate that the fear is that he will by then be trapped, because of these earlier policy decisions, in useless and difficult policy terrain; but things may not be that bad. The world will by then have moved on a little bit, and unpredictable events will have intervened which may well alter the terms of public discourse, and to which DC may be able to react profitably, in getting across his message. Such transitory and unpredictable factors often make the difference between political success and failure, rather more than the possession of perfect policies at the outset.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tDeckchair of despair |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:23\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill.\"\n\n\nReading them doesn't mean Cameron understands or agreees with them!\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:39\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tI agree with JohnC on the need for clear, thought, through philosophy.\n\n\nThe problem with Thatchers approach was that the public perception was that we never got the improvements in public services - Mrs T never stood up and said \"as a result of my policies I'm now going to spend more on the NHS\" - her government did spend more but seemed ashamed to admit it. The rhetoric was that of Dracula, the talk of tax cuts rather than using the benefits of growth to improve education, to improve health, improve policing. We did all those things but message was always about controlling expenditure,  capping profligate local authorities and cutting taxes.\n\n\nAnd then under Major we got tax increases, more control of public expenditure. Can you blame to voters for saying \"we've been promised better public services... when?\" and voting for the party which said they would follow tory economic policy but deliver the improvements we'd been promising for 18 years?\n\n\nWhat's DC said thats so awful? That we need to concentrate on improving the lot of  the poor? that we need to concentrate on improving the NHS for everybody not just those (who like me) have private medical insurance? That the quality of life is important  and we should care for our environment? That he believes in a lower tax economy but not in open ended tax cuts irrespective of social needs?\n\n\nHe's changed the tone of our discourse with our electorate to show that Concervatism is about improving the lot of everyone.  I trust that when we have policies developed they will be developed from the conservative principles but their objectives must be seen to reach out to the disadvantaged, to those pushed into Labour's dependency culture as well as to the well off middle classes.\n\n\nThe article in The Scotsman shows the failure of  decades of Labour control in Glasgow - lower life expectancy, high social damage. We need to show we can deal with those failures.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\t Ted |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:47\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"I am encouraged by the news that he reads Hayek and JS Mill.\"\n\n\nAs part of my degree I had to read works by the likes of Marx, Lenin, Engels and Chomsky.

It's nice to see that everyone is onboard and willing after only a month.\n\n\nRichard is right though. Policies were never the problem. It was image and branding. Hopefully David Cameron will manage to rebrand the party by superficially changing policies, rather than actually changing Conservative policies.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tChris Palmer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 14:58\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJust a few points. First, I don't know whether some of the forgetfulness is down to the aforementioned grim reaper preparing for collections, but are we not forgetting that Labour moved considerably to the right to get elected. The point of Cameron is that he is not moving even further to the right 'just to be different'. He is fighting off Labour in the centre, who will then lurk to the left, leaving us lots of room for policies like the 'Patients Passport' in years to come. Politics is about the long haul now, not quick fixes; look what has happened to us over the last few elections. This is what Cameron and the younger generation like myself see. We need room to breathe. Forming right-wing policies in the current climate will not get us elected whilst Labour has the centre ground. Cameron is assuming (wrongly it seems) that the so-called 'core vote' is intelligent enough to understand this process.\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMatthew |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 15:38\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe problem, Matthew, is that we have been here before and look what that led to?  The Butskellites' \"great idea\" was to position themselves one cigarette paper to the right of Labour and then fall back on good old-fashioned deference to get out the vote. They were always implying that they would do great things which surprise surprise never came to pass. Those other great scions of Eton and Oxford, Eden and MacMillan, plus Ted Heath, simply helped the Labour Party bed down the post-war consensus that social justice = collectivised mediocrity. At least the Butskellites could fall back on deference and the figurehead of Winston Churchill. He is well and truly dead and the deference has now, thankfully, gone. There is no longer a role for another left-leaning party which is anti-meritocratic, protects vested social interests and has only a lukewarm enthusiasm for liberal economics. If you want that cocktail, Labour and the Lib Dems already provide poverty of aspiration by the boatload.  \n\n\nTo pick up a point made by Malcolm earlier, it is not my views on Cameron's tenure at Carlton which ultimately matter. It is what the public and Labour will make of them and it is not a very happy tale. Add to that the fact that his spin doctor role at Carlton was Cameron's ONLY position of responsibility outside the closed incestuous world of Tory politics at Westminster. \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tMichael McGowan |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 16:04\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFair point, however there is a difference.

The political differences between Blair and Brown are actually rather small (remember that Brown is the co-architect of New Labour). The only real differences are that Brown sees less scope for subscontracting to the private sector.\n\n\nAnd as for this Labour has moved to the right nonsense, giving up nationalising the means of production and distribution does not mean they have moved in other areas!  \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJames Hellyer |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 16:30\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Nice to see Simple Simon up to his usual tricks again. What made me laugh was the opening to his article along the lines of 'people are expecting me to rant about Cameron and co, but their antics are not worthy of any comment from an intellectual god like myself', which was followed by the rest of his article, which was, quelle surprise, a rant about Cameron and co. Classic.\"\n\n\nI'm sorry, Daniel, but Heffer is just not that stupid (though it is convenient for you to pretend he is). \n\n\nIf you would like me to translate what he was saying...\n\n\nCameron expects the likes of Heffer to respond with bile at every pronouncement he makes, i.e. to take them at face value and scream at the abandonment of traditional conservative policies. \n\n\nInstead, Heffer is looking at the bigger picture -- the tactic Cameron is pursuing -- of *wanting* the likes of Heffer to scream at each policy announcement, each vacuous Labour-lite statement. \n\n\nIn other words, he is *not* taking Cameron's pronouncements at face value as indications of where Cameron is going, but is responding to Cameron's overall tactical approach.\n\n\nDo you get it?\n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tJohn Hustings |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 17:02\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tI read somewhere that Norman Lamont, DC's former boss, doesn't think that DC's political direction is fully formed.  That tallies with my impression of Cameron from one of the hustings.  There was enough vagueness and lack of philosophical direction to raise the same doubt in my mind.  \n\n\nThere has been a lot of robust but reasoned criticism of Cameron in this thread and I suspect there is far more to come.  \n\n\t\t\n\n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPosted by:\n\t\t\tThe Watchman |\n\t\t\tJanuary 04, 2006 at 17:10\n            \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAs I've posted before, I don't think we should be surprised by DC's image-led positioning.

Not bad for a month. So this is not the time for us members to start laying into him.\n\n\nBut articles by commentators like Stelzer, Randall and Heffer are v helpful in drip-drip-dripping on public consciousness.

This revealed that there had been a small national outbreak of S.  Thompson phage type (PT)3 in September and October 2004, affecting three areas of England .\n\n    From 1 September to 30 November 2004, LEP reported on 46 human isolations of S.  Thompson. Of these, 31 were S.  Thompson PT3, fully sensitive to all antimicrobial agents, and eight were S.  Thompson PT1a resistant to sulphonamides and trimethoprim, of which six were connected with an outbreak in a young offenders' institution. The remaining isolates were PT1 (five cases), and PT6 and PT7 (one case each). The cases of S . Thompson PT3 were distributed throughout England and the majority occurred in September 2004. Eight-four per cent of cases were aged between 15 and 64 years and 60% were female. No non-human isolates of S.  Thompson PT3 have been recorded in 2004. The outbreak of S . Thompson PT3 occurred at the same time as a much larger outbreak of the morphologically-similar serotype S. Newport , with over 650 cases. In 2003, LEP reported on seven cases of S.  Thompson PT3, of which four had been abroad ( Greece 2, and one each in Thailand and Spain ), and two isolates from raw burgers. The source of the S. Thompson PT3 outbreak in England and Wales in September 2004 is unknown.\n\n    Since September 2004, outbreaks or cases of infection with S.  Thompson have occurred in three other European countries. In particular, there was an extensive outbreak in Norway in November 2004, associated with ruccola (rocket) salad imported from Italy (1, 2). Isolates of S.  Thompson PT3 from England have been studied using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All the English strains have a distinct pulsed-field profile provisionally designated S . Thompson PFGE type B. This profile has been compared with electronically-transmitted PFGE profiles of isolates of S.  Thompson from outbreaks or cases of infection in Norway , Sweden , and Denmark made since September 2004, and also with isolates produced in Sweden , but derived from S.  Thompson from Italian ruccola salad. At least two PFGE profiles were identified in the isolates from Norway , Sweden , Denmark , and Italy , both of which were different to that of the type B profile from the S.  Thompson PT3 isolates from England .\n\n    There is no evidence that the implicated ruccola salad was imported into the UK from Italy in September 2004. The conclusion is that the strain of S.  Thompson PT3 responsible for the small outbreak in England in September 2004 is different to those that have caused outbreaks or cases of infection in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark since November 2004, and also different to strains from ruccola salad originating in Italy.\n\n     \n\n    References\n\n     \n\n    \t1.\tNygard K, Lassen J, Aavitisland P.

On 11 March 2005, data values in this article were amended (click here to see changes), the full erratum was published in CDRWeekly volume 15 no. 11 15(11), 17 February 2005.\n\n    \n\nThe data for tuberculosis cases reported in 2002 to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance System has now been finalised. The main findings are: 6861 cases were reported in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (table 1) which represents an overall rate of 12.7 per 100,000 population (England 13.4, Wales 5.3, and Northern Ireland 3.9). Compared to 2001, the overall number of cases has increased by 3.1% and the rate by 2.4%.\n\n\n\nTable 1 Number of tuberculosis case reports and rate, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland: 1999 to 2002 (Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance - final results)\n\n  \tYear \tNumber of cases\tRate per 100, 000 population\n\t1999\t5761\n\t10.8\n\n\t2000\t6323\n\t11.8\n\n\t2001\t6652\n\t12.4\n\n\t2002\t6861\n\t12.7\n\n\n\n  *Source population data: ONS mid-year estimates.\n\n  London accounted for 44% of all cases reported and had the highest rate (40.6 cases per 100,000 population) of all the regions/countries. The Midlands and the North West regions accounted for 28% of cases and outside London the regions/countries with the highest reported rates were West Midlands (15.2), East Midlands (11.6), and Yorkshire and Humber (10.3).\n\n  Where place of birth was known, the proportion of cases born abroad in 2002 was 67.1% compared to 62.6% in 2001. In 2002, the tuberculosis rate was 22 times higher in the foreign born population (rate 90 per 100,000 population) than in those born in the UK (4.1 per 100,000).\n\n  The combined ethnic group of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi make up the highest proportion of cases (36.9%) followed by the White (26.8%) and Black African (21.4%) ethnic groups. The number of cases in the Black African ethnic group increased by 38% in 2002.\n\n  The proportion of isoniazid resistance in culture-confirmed cases with a known drug susceptibility result increased from 6.7 % in 2001 to 7.1% in 2002. The overall level of multi-drug resistance (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) remained stable at 0.8% compared to 0.8 % in 2001.\n\n  The finalising of data involves checking and cleaning the national database and linking the reports to reference laboratory information (Mycobnet) for culture and drug susceptibility results. The annual report for the finalised 2002 data will be published in January 2005.\n\n  Provisional data for 2003 enhanced tuberculosis surveillance is also now available. There were 6,933 cases reported in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 2003 compared to the equivalent provisional figure of 6974 cases in 2002. This represents an overall rate of 12.7 per 100,000 population (England 13.6, Wales 5.4, and Northern Ireland 3.9), which is a little lower than the provisional rate for 2002 of 12.9 per 100,000 (England 13.5, Wales 5.8, and Northern Ireland 3.4).\n\n  Final data for 2002, and 2003 provisional data tables and figures can be accessed on the Health Protection Agency’s Centre for Infections tuberculosis website, available at: <http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/tb/data_menu.htm>. \n\n  Changes to this article, 11 March 2005:\n\n      \n\n      1.

E. sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that poses little risk to healthy, term infants. Premature, low birth weight and immunocompromised infants are specifically at risk. Previous E. sakazakii infections have been associated with poor hygiene and storage of reconstituted powdered infant formula (2,3) . In this instance the organism has not yet been detected in Pregestimil, but this is not uncommon when there is low level contamination of milk products. As a precautionary measure, the company has withdrawn the product worldwide. Further investigations are continuing in France to identify the source of the infection (4).\n\n\n\nThe batch of the product under investigation was not distributed in the United Kingdom (UK) and supplies of Pregestimil in the UK are not implicated. An initial investigation of reports received by the Health Protection Agency’s Centre for Infections, to date, shows no reports of confirmed E. sakazakii in children in the second half of 2004. Since the extent of any contamination is not known there may be contaminated batches in the UK. Any laboratory that identifies E. sakazakii even presumptively should immediately contact the referring physician to check whether the source patient is an infant taking baby milk, and if so to urgently inform the local Health Protection Unit or the CDSC duty doctor at the Centre for Infections, tel: 0208 200 6868. Since other organisms may initially appear to be E. sakazakki, any such isolates should be referred to the Centre for Infections, for the attention of Tyrone Pitt, email: <tyrone.pitt@hpa.org.uk>. Outside working hours the SRMD duty doctor should be contacted via telephone: 020 8200 4400. \n\n\n\nPregestimil is a hydrolysed protein formula usually prescribed for infants who have fat and/or protein malabsorption. As it will not be available in the UK until further notice, health professionals are being advised to prescribe other suitable alternatives. Infants currently being fed Pregestimil can continue until an alternative prescription is obtained. The importance of good hygiene practices in preparing formula feeds from powdered formula is being re-emphasised to parents. Instructions are set out in the leaflet Bottle Feeding available on the Department of Health website (5). In particular, it is important to store made-up formula in the coldest part of the fridge, preferably at 5°C for no more than 24 hours and throw away any left over milk.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \t1.\t Department of Health.

General vaccination information and travel health advice will be available through their web-based (database driven) Vaccine Information Service (VIS),\n\navailable at <http://www.apmsd.co.uk/>. Information relating exclusively to Aventis Pasteur MSD products will continue to be available from their medical information department on tel: 01628 587693. Queries related to vaccines and products of other pharmaceutical companies should be directed to the individual company. \n\n  The online VIS provides detailed information on travel, adult, and childhood vaccines, and news on outbreak and vaccine recommendations for all countries worldwide. It also includes travel-health advice including maps, current outbreak information, and specific travel advice country-by-country. The service also provides information to help answer individual clinical queries or problems relating to vaccination.\n\n  Healthcare professionals can register for VIS online free of charge using their GMC/NMC/RPS number. \n\n      \n\n  Healthcare professionals who require pre-travel health advice for travellers with complex queries (such as those with special health needs or those with complicated travel itineraries) are advised to use the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) telephone advice line, tel: 020 7380 9234.\n\n  Aventis Pasteur MSD, in conjunction with NaTHNaC and the Department of Health, has compiled a list of useful sources of travel health advice for healthcare professionals (2), which includes websites (free of charge), telephone advice lines and a list of standard travel medicine texts and literature.\n\n  \n\n  References\n\n  1.Aventis Pasteur MSD.

The day is organised in partnership with EPIET training sites in the Five Nations of England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. \n\nEPIET is an elite field epidemiology training programme, which has been funded by the European Commission DG Sanco since 1995. Field epidemiologists apply rigorous scientific investigative methods to identify and solve urgent public health problems. Field epidemiologists discover and find the cause of outbreaks and epidemics and work out how to bring them under control. For this reason they are often thought of as ‘health detectives’. \n\nOf the 117 EPIET fellows and associates from the past decade, more than 40 have had a connection with the Five Nations, either by being one of the 26 people who have come here for training from one of ten other European countries, or by being sent by the UK (ten people) or Ireland (four people) to train in one of seven other countries in Europe. Together they are building a safer more responsive public health capacity for the whole European Community.\n\nThe day aims to illustrate the contribution of EPIET to European public health through presentations from EPIET fellows and alumni on the wide range of work they have carried out during and after their training. The investigations have been carried out in all sorts of different settings and on scales ranging from families and local hospitals in various European countries to refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan. What they have in common is a rigorous investigative and scientific approach to defining and solving critical public health problems. The day includes presentations which have previously only been made in closed meetings.\n\nThe European Commission’s DG SANCO had the foresight to support EPIET before events such as SARS and avian influenza raised the priority of having such a network of highly trained professionals available across Europe. The European Commission has now given this priority even greater recognition through recently establishing the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), which will be supported by the EPIET network of fellows and alumni.

You can reserve a seat on the more popular routes, and certain types of ticket such as the APEX rail ticket can save a lot of money. Travel out of commuter hours and the price will also be less.The Trainline is a great resource for calculating train journeys and booking the resulting ticket online. Click here for more information\n\n\n Travel add-ons such as airport parking, hotels and lounges make the journey\n  easier and substantial discounts are available for booking online in advance.\n  Holiday\n  Extras is one of the biggest players in this market with a very easy\n  to use website.\n  As airports become more and more of a cattle market, Lounge\n  Pass (for occasional\n  travellers) and Priority\n  Pass (for more regular travellers) provide access\n  to Airport Lounges whilst you wait for your flight. A quiet sanctum with complimentary\n  drinks, papers & magazines and comfortable seating, it's a great way to start\n  your holiday.\n\nBBC Travel News\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget your breakdown Insurance. If you break down on a Motorway and have not got your own, then the Highways Agency will organise one for you but you will be expected to pay for the recovery plus any storage costs incurred.\n\nIf you are abroad when you break down, then you may well have higher costs as well as either having to arrange repairs in a foreign language or arrange recovery back to the UK. With plenty of competition in the market, you can get some good deals at the moment.\n\n The AA is the biggest and most well know Operator in the UK and, for a limited time, you can get cover from just £29.

'A quarter of...' can provide you with all those childhood sweets - barley sugars, Liquorice, toffees, bon bons, kola kubes. Have a look and see if they have your favourite.

There is, however, an urgent need to alter the current renewables framework and a number of different options are analysed in this report.\n\nFull Report and Summary available.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbon Papers \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbon Papers -Â March 2007\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ \nCarbon Papers -Â December 2006 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCarbon Papers -Â October 2006 \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe to Carbon Papers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tÂ© Copyright The Carbon Trust 2008\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tLegal\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tContact us\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tJobs\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tSitemap\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\tLinks\n\t\n\t\t\t RSS\n\t\t\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n  \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The length of time spent waiting for planned NHS treatment is an \nimportant issue for patients and their carers.  In February and March \n2005, this Committee held three evidence sessions on NHS waiting \ntimes in Wales.  In May 2005, we published a highly critical report, \nconcluding that waiting times for Welsh patients were too long.  We \nmade 13 recommendations to encourage the Welsh Assembly \nGovernment and local healthcare organisations to take a longer-term, \nmore strategic approach to tackling long waiting times and their causes. \n1\n2. On the basis of a report by the Auditor General for Wales, on 6 July \n2006 we took evidence on the progress that has been made in \naddressing long waits for planned NHS treatment in Wales from Mrs Ann \nLloyd, Head of the Health and Social Services Department of the Welsh \nAssembly Government and Chief Executive of the NHS in Wales, and Mr \nJohn Hill-Tout, joint Director of Performance and Operations in the \nHealth and Social Care Department.  In particular, we examined whether \nthe NHS in Wales is on track to deliver ongoing sustainable reductions in \nwaiting times.  We concluded that there has been considerable progress \nin reducing long waits and addressing their causes, but further action is \nneeded to address regional variations and careful management of known \nrisks is required to deliver and sustain ongoing reductions. \nThere has been considerable progress in reducing long \nwaiting times and addressing their causes, but regional \nvariations remain a concern \n3. By March 2006, waits of 12 months or more had been virtually eliminated \nfor patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment or treatment as an \ninpatient/ day case.  This is a significant milestone for the NHS in Wales \ntowards eradicating unacceptably long waiting times.  This reduction \nfollows the introduction of a clear strategic framework for reducing \nwaiting times and addressing their underlying causes, in line with this \nCommittee’s recommendations.  This framework includes improved \n                                            \n1\n Auditor General for Wales report, NHS Waiting Times: Follow-Up Report, June 2006 \n  \nperformance management systems, longer term funding arrangements \nand ambitious targets.  Mrs Lloyd emphasised the importance of the \nfocus on achieving the Welsh Assembly Government’s targets in \ndelivering the reduction, and told us that NHS organisations have risen \n2\nfantastically well to the challenge of reducing waiting times in Wales. \n4. Nonetheless, there are still areas where improvement is needed, for \nexample reducing cancelled operations and the impact of emergency \npressures.  We are also concerned about variations in waiting times \nbetween regions and organisations.  Although regional variations in \nwaiting times have reduced, significant variations remain, with waiting \ntimes in south Wales generally longer than in the north.  We agree with \nMrs Lloyd that these variations reflect differences in the effectiveness of \nproviders and their commissioners.  We welcome Mrs Lloyd’s \ncommitment to eliminate the inequity of regional variations in waiting \ntimes, by 2009, by ensuring that all organisations strive to match the \nperformance of the best. \nCareful management of known risks is required to deliver and \nsustain ongoing reductions in waiting times \n5. The Welsh Assembly Government’s target that no patient will wait more \nthan 26 weeks from referral to treatment by December 2009 is ambitious.  \nIn order to meet this target for the whole of the patient’s pathway through \nthe elective care system, careful management of known risks will be \nrequired to sustain ongoing reductions in waiting times.  In particular: \na. Mrs Lloyd said extremely long waits for some diagnostic and \ntherapy services was the biggest problem, exacerbated by staff \nshortages in particular specialities, notably Welsh speaking \nspeech and language therapists; \nb. redesigning the patient pathway will require significant \ninnovation and modernisation, but Mrs Lloyd told us that Local \nDelivery Plans (developed by local health communities to deliver \n                                            \n2\n Paragraph 179 \n  \nwaiting time improvements) had received low scores for \nmodernisation; \nc. measuring the whole of the patient pathway, rather than parts of \nit as has traditionally been the case, is a particular risk: the \ncombination of new data definitions and increased focus on \ntargets increases the risk of inappropriate data manipulation.  \nThe Assembly Government has made a welcome commitment \nto ongoing validation of waiting list data; \nd. Mrs Lloyd told us that NHS reconfiguration, in line with its ten \nyear vision for health and social care, Designed for Life, will not \nbe allowed to impact on plans to reduce waiting times.  \nNonetheless, careful management will be required to address \nrisks associated with organisational change and uncertainty; \ne. long waiting times can act as a damper on demand, and Mrs \nLloyd said that they are monitoring this risk closely.  She raised \nthe possibility that, in the event of a pandemic, waiting times \ntargets would be suspended in order to prioritise treating \ncritically ill patients; \nf. short-term financial pressures can impact on long term \nobjectives.  Mrs Lloyd told us that the Assembly Government is \nstressing the importance of organisations ensuring that short-\nterm cuts do not undermine the long term goals of reducing \nwaiting times; and \ng. clinical engagement is crucial, and Mrs Lloyd recognised that \nlower waiting times could not be delivered without the active \nsupport of clinicians. \nRecommendations \ni) In a dynamic situation of ongoing reductions in waiting times and targets, \nthere is a risk that some consultants may tell patients that they will have \nto wait longer than the current Assembly Government waiting time \ntargets.  We recommend that Local Health Boards and NHS Trusts \n  \nprovide up to date waiting times information to all clinicians so that \nthey can accurately inform patients about the length of time they \nmay wait for treatment. \nii) Although the number of cancelled operations has reduced overall since \nour last report, progress appears to have stalled in the last financial year.  \nMrs Lloyd told us that the Welsh Assembly Government was not fully \naware of the reasons why some patients were cancelling their \noperations.  We recommend that the Welsh Assembly Government \ncarry out a comprehensive review of the reasons why patients \ncancel and develop preventive measures based on that review. \niii) Some patients currently experience unacceptably long waiting times for \ndiagnostic and therapy services.  Mrs Lloyd told us that this is the biggest \nproblem they currently have in delivering the 26 week patient pathway \ntarget.  She told us that there were particular skills shortages in some \nspecialist areas, most notably Welsh speaking speech and language \ntherapists.  We recommend that the Welsh Assembly Government \nrequire local health communities to demonstrate in their Local \nDelivery Plans how they will reduce diagnostic and therapy waiting \ntimes; this should be linked to workforce planning to address skills \nshortages, such as Welsh speaking speech and language \ntherapists. \niv) In order to deliver a new patient pathway, significant innovation and \nmodernisation will be required but this year’s Local Delivery Plans \nreceived low scores for innovation.  To deliver the Assembly \nGovernment’s ambitious new 26 week target, at the same time as \navoiding inappropriate data manipulation, NHS organisations \nshould focus significant attention on modernisation and innovation \nin their Local Delivery Plans for 2007/2008.  \nv) Clinical engagement is absolutely crucial to the delivery of lower waiting \ntimes.  In our previous report we recommended that performance targets \nshould be set locally and agreed and owned by clinicians.  However, Mrs \nLloyd told us that performance indicators had been “imposed” on the \n  \nservice.  We recommend that the Welsh Assembly Government \nshould work with NHS organisations to set local performance \ntargets and indicators, rather than impose them centrally, so that \nthey are agreed and owned by clinicians. \n \n  \nThere has been considerable progress in reducing \nlong waiting times and addressing their causes, but \nregional variations remain a concern \n6. In 2005, this Committee concluded that NHS waiting times were too long, \nparticularly in some parts of Wales.  We also concluded that initiatives \nhad focused on the symptoms, rather than the causes, of long waits and \nwe made 13 recommendations aimed at encouraging a more strategic, \n3\nlong term approach to tackling long waiting times for patients.  In re-\nexamining NHS waiting times in Wales, we have focused particular \nattention on whether progress has been made: \na. in reducing long waiting times and addressing their causes; and \nb. in addressing regional variations in waiting times.. \nThe NHS in Wales has made significant progress in reducing \nwaiting times and addressing the causes in a strategic \ncontext \nWaiting times have reduced substantially  \n7. We are very pleased to note that, as figures 1 and 2 show, by the end of \nMarch 2006, waiting times of more than 12 months for planned treatment \nhad been virtually eliminated.  This is a major milestone for the NHS in \nWales in progressing towards lower waiting times for patients.  At the \nend of March 2006, there were no patients breaching the current 12 \nmonth target for treatment as an inpatient/day case, and only 15 patients \nhad been waiting longer than the 12 month target for a first outpatient \nappointment.  Mrs Lloyd told us that these 15 patients had been waiting \n4\nfor an appointment at an English NHS Trust. \n8. We note Mrs Lloyd’s assurance that recent figures were more robust \nbecause waiting lists had been validated and independently reviewed, \nand trusts were more effectively managing their waiting lists and times to \naddress previous administrative failures that led to inappropriate \n5\ncounting of patients.  We also note Mrs Lloyd’s comment, in relation to \n                                            \n3\n Audit Committee report, NHS Waiting Times in Wales (May 2005) \n4\n Paragraph 252; AGW report paragraph 1.1 and Figures 1 and 2 \n5\n Paragraph 178 \n  \nthe 15 patients who had been waiting for an appointment at an English \nNHS Trust, that there are differences in the data definitions currently \nused in England.  Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of Welsh \ncommissioners to track the progress of their patients and to ensure that \nthey experience waiting times that are consistent with Assembly \n6\nGovernment targets, regardless of where they are treated. \nFigure 1: Patients waiting more than 12 or 18 months for a first outpatient \nappointment  \n40 40000 000\n35 35000 000\nP Pa attiient ents s w  wa ait itiing  ng 1 12 2  m mont onths hs or   or m mo ore  re \n30 30000 000\n25 25000 000\n20 20000 000\nP Pa attiient ents s w  wa ait itiing  ng 1 18 8  m mont onths hs or   or m mo ore  re \n15 15000 000\n10 10000 000\n500 5000 0\n0 0\n \n \n \n                                            \n6\n Paragraphs 252 and 253 \n \nA Ap pr-00 r-00\nJun-00 Jun-00\nA Aug-0 ug-00 0\nOct Oct- -00 00\nDe Dec- c-0 00 0\nF Feb-01 eb-01\nA Ap pr-01 r-01\nJun-01 Jun-01\nA Aug-0 ug-01 1\nOct Oct- -01 01\nDe Dec c- -0 01 1\nF Feb-0 eb-02 2\nApr-02 Apr-02\nJun-02 Jun-02\nA Aug- ug-02 02\nOc Oct-0 t-02 2\nDec Dec- -02 02\nF Feb-0 eb-03 3\nApr-03 Apr-03\nJun-03 Jun-03\nA Aug-0 ug-03 3\nOc Oct-0 t-03 3\nDec Dec- -03 03\nF Feb-0 eb-04 4\nApr-04 Apr-04\nJun-04 Jun-04\nA Aug- ug-04 04\nOc Oct-0 t-04 4\nDec Dec- -04 04\nF Feb-0 eb-05 5\nApr-05 Apr-05\nJun-05 Jun-05\nA Aug-0 ug-05 5\nOc Oct-0 t-05 5\nDec Dec- -05 05\nF Feb-06 eb-06\nMa Mar r- -0 06 6 \nFigure 2: The number of people waiting more than 12 or 18 months for \ntreatment as an inpatient or day case  \n14000 14000 14000\nP P Pa a atttiiient ent ents s s w  w  wa a aiiitttiiing 1 ng 1 ng 12 2 2   m m mont ont onths hs hs or   or   or m m mo o ore  re  re \n12000 12000 12000\n10000 10000 10000\n8000 8000 8000\nP P Pa a atttiiient ent ents s s w  w  wa a aiiitttiiing 1 ng 1 ng 18 8 8   m m mont ont onths hs hs or   or   or m m mo o ore  re  re \n6000 6000 6000\n4000 4000 4000\n2000 2000 2000\n0 0 0\n \n \n9. The historical pattern of reductions in waiting times (figures 1 and 2) \nshows a marked decrease in long waiting times towards the end of the \nfinancial year, followed by subsequent rises.  This reflects the previous \n7\npattern of expenditure on short term waiting times initiatives.  Mrs Lloyd \nassured us that this “bounce” had not occurred during the start of this \nfinancial year; although there had been a small increase in outpatients \nwaiting over 12 months, this was due to a problem in dermatology at \n8\nCardiff and Vale NHS Trust, where there was a dispute.  Mrs Lloyd \nattributed the success in largely avoiding a bounce to the sustainable \nsolutions – including three year funding, local delivery planning and \n9 \nfeedback on GP referrals – now in place.  We note that figures \npublished after our hearing show that the number of outpatients waiting \nmore than 12 months rose from 15 at the end of March 2006, to 305 at \n10 \nthe end of June 2006.  This is not a small increase and we expect that \nthe Welsh Assembly Government will urgently address the reasons \nbehind this rise. \n                                            \n7\n AGW report, paragraph 1.1 \n8\n Paragraph 186 \n9\n Paragraphs 186 and 187 \n10\n www.statswales.wales.gov.uk \n \nAp Ap Apr r r- - -00 00 00\nJun- Jun- Jun-00 00 00\nA A Aug- ug- ug-00 00 00 00 00\nOct Oct Oct Oct Oct- - - - -\n00 00 00 00 00\nDe De De De Dec c c c c- - - - -0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0\nF F F F Feb-01 eb-01 eb- eb- eb-\nAp Apr r- -01 01\nJun- Jun-01 01\nAu Aug g- -0 01 1\nOct Oct- -\n01 01\nDe Dec c- -0 01 1\nF Feb- eb-02 02\nAp Apr r- -02 02\nJun- Jun-02 02\nAu Aug g- -0 02 2\nOct Oct- -02 02\nDe Dec c- -0 02 2\nF Feb- eb-03 03\nAp Apr r- -0 03 3\nJun Jun- -03 03\nA Aug-03 ug-03\nOct Oct- -03 03\nDe Dec- c-0 03 3\nFe Feb b- -0 04 4\nA Ap pr-0 r-04 4\nJun-04 Jun-04\nA Aug-04 ug-04\nOct Oct- -04 04\nDe Dec- c-0 04 4\nFe Feb b- -0 05 5\nA Ap pr-0 r-05 5\nJun-05 Jun-05\nA Aug- ug-05 05\nOct Oct- -05 05\nDe Dec- c-0 05 5\nF Feb-06 eb-06\nMa Mar r- -0 06 6 \n10. We are concerned that, despite the existence of the 12 month target and \nthe successful reductions in waiting times, there is a risk that some \npatients are still being told that they will have to wait longer than \nAssembly Government targets for their treatment.  Members of the \ncommittee are aware of some patients for whom such bad advice can \n11\ncause unnecessary concern.   We agree with Mrs Lloyd that no patient \n12\nshould be told that they will wait longer than the access target. \nThere has been a welcome focus on addressing the causes of long \nwaits  \n11. Our previous report on NHS waiting times concluded that the NHS in \nWales had focused on the symptoms, rather than the causes, of long \nwaiting times.  We therefore welcome the Auditor General’s finding that \nthere has been progress in addressing the causes of long waits in a clear \n13\nstrategic context.  In particular, his report outlines the steps have been \ntaken to address high demand, capacity problems, and delayed transfers \n14\nof care.  Mrs Lloyd and Mr Hill-Tout expanded on some of the detail of \nthis progress, including referral management centres, efficiency targets \nand the Assembly Government’s strategy for emergency care (as set out \nin Figure 3 below). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n11\n Paragraphs 180 to 185 \n12\n Paragraph 183 \n13\n AGW Report, summary paragraph 4 \n14\n AGW report, paragraphs 1.3 to 1.15 \n  \nFigure 3: Examples of steps taken to address the causes of long waiting \ntimes \nCause of long waiting Steps taken  \ntimes \n• Pilot referral centres, through which all outpatient \nHigh demand \n15\nreferrals are passed \n• New monitoring systems to provide feedback for \n16\nGPs on the quality of referrals \n• SaFF efficiency targets covering: \nCapacity problems \no average length of stay; \no day case rates; \no ratio of new to follow up outpatient \nappointments; \no patients not attending; \no cancelled operations; and \no waiting list management (treatment in turn) \n17\n \n• Ring-fenced elective capacity to protect from \nemergency pressures, including Units at St Woolos \nand Llandough, and a further 65 schemes currently \n18\nunder consideration \n• New emergency care services strategy, including \nplans for a single access point and a clinically \n19\ndriven ambulance service \n20\n• Guidance issued on patient choice of care home \nDelayed transfers of \ncare \n12. Nonetheless, there remain areas where further progress is needed.  \nAlthough the total number of cancelled operations has reduced since \n21\n2003/2004, progress stalled in 2005/2006.  Mrs Lloyd told us that \nfigures for the beginning of the 2006/2007 financial year showed the \n22\nlowest number of cancellations for the past five years; we hope this \nsignals that the NHS is back on track to continue reducing the number of \ncancelled operations.  It is important to analyse whether cancellations \narise for entirely valid clinical reasons or for avoidable clinical reasons, \n                                            \n15\n Paragraphs 219 and 285; AGW report paragraph 1.5 \n16\n Paragraphs 219 and 285; AGW report paragraph 1.5 \n17\n Paragraphs 205 and 215; AGW report paragraph 1.12 and Figure 5 \n18\n Paragraphs 206, 238 and 239; AGW report paragraph 1.9 \n19\n Paragraphs 221 to 223 \n20\n AGW report, paragraph 1.14 \n21\n AGW report, paragraph 1.11 \n22\n Paragraph 213 \n  \neither because of problems in the hospital or because of the actions of \npatients.  We share Mrs Lloyd’s concern that the vast majority of \ncancellations are due to patient choice or cancellations by the hospital \n23\nfor non-clinical reasons.  A more detailed analysis of the reasons for \npatient cancellations might enable better solutions to be developed.  We \nagree with Mrs Lloyd that it is unacceptable for operations to be \ncancelled by the hospital because the consultant is on leave; this is \nentirely avoidable as consultants have to provide at least six weeks’ \n24\nnotice of leave. \n13. The second key area where further progress is required is protecting \nelective capacity from the impact of emergency pressures; unplanned \nemergency admissions occupy beds that could otherwise have been \n25\nused to treat patients from the waiting list.  Our last report on NHS \nwaiting times showed that the ratio of emergency to elective admissions \n26\nwas higher in Wales than other parts of the UK.  The Auditor General’s \nreport shows that this ratio has remained static for the four years to \n27\n2005/2006.  Mrs Lloyd outlined two key ways in which the Assembly \nGovernment will address this problem in its emergency care strategy, \nDelivering Emergency Care Services, (published shortly after we took \nevidence): a single access point for emergency services to ensure that \npatients are seen in the most appropriate setting and thereby to reduce \nthe impact on elective services; and making the ambulance service more \n28\nclinically driven.  Mrs Lloyd also told us that the two new units at \nSt.Woolos and Llandough are intended to provide additional protected \nelective capacity.  We welcome this new capacity, but we are concerned \nthat despite being ready, the Llandough facility is not yet fully \n29\noperational.  We expect this situation to be resolved as quickly as \npossible. \n                                            \n23\n Paragraphs 213 and 225 to 230 \n24\n Paragraph 213 \n25\n Paragraph 179 \n26\n Audit Committee report, NHS Waiting Times in Wales (May 2005), page 4 \n27\n AGW report, paragraph 1.8 \n28\n Paragraphs 221 and 222 \n29\n Paragraphs 206 and 235 to 239  \n  \nThere is now a clear strategic framework for improving \nperformance and reducing waiting times \n14. Mrs Lloyd told us that the main reason for the reduction in long waiting \ntimes has been the focus on the importance of achieving the waiting \ntimes targets, both in relation to the benefits to the health of the \npopulation and ensuring a more appropriate response to managing \n30\npeople who are waiting for intervention and elective care.  When we \nlast considered this issue, the focus on delivering waiting times targets \ninvolved short-term, expensive and unsustainable measures to treat \npatients at the end of the financial year in order to meet a target; despite \n31\nnot being ambitious, these targets were still not met.  We are therefore \npleased to note the Auditor General’s conclusion that the NHS is now \nfocused on ambitious targets, supported by a clear strategic \n32\nframework.  Designed for Life, the Assembly Government’s 10 year \nstrategy for the NHS in Wales, sets out a vision for improving and \nmodernising NHS services.  The Access 2009 project, which is being led \nby the Delivery and Support Unit, sets out the specific steps that need to \nbe taken to deliver the Assembly Government target that, by December \n2009, no patient will wait more than 26 weeks from referral to treatment, \nincluding diagnostic and therapy waiting times.  This includes clear \n33\ninterim targets, although these are still provisional (Figure 4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n30\n Paragraph 176 \n31\n Audit Committee report NHS Waiting Times in Wales (2005) page 4 \n32\n AGW report, summary paragraph 4 \n33\n AGW report, paragraphs 1.17 to 1.19 and Figure 7 \n  \nFigure 4: The Assembly has set more challenging targets for reducing \nNHS waiting times \n March  March March March March 31 March 31 Dec \n31 31 31 31 2008 2009 2009 \n2004 2005 2006 2007 (provisional) (provisional) \nOutpatient  18 18 12 8 6 months 4 months  \nmonths months months months\n1\nInpatient/ 18 18 12 8 6 months 4 months  \nday case months months months months\n2\nDiagnostics    36 12 weeks 6 weeks  \nweeks \nTherapies    36  24 weeks 12 weeks  \nweeks \nReferral to       \n26 \ntreatment \nweeks\n1\n The 2004/2005 SaFF set an 18 month target for inpatient/ day case but the Assembly \nGovernment announced in June 2004 that no patient would wait more than 12 months for \ntreatment as an inpatient/day case unless they were awaiting treatment under the Second \nOffer scheme, or had rejected Second Offer treatment \n2\n ECG scans have a separate, lower target of 24 weeks \nSource: Wales Audit Office \n \n15. The waiting time strategy is linked to delivery and development of \nservices in individual health communities – Trusts and relevant Local \nHealth Boards – through Local Delivery Plans.  These plans are based \non a detailed analysis of demand and capacity; recurrent funding is \nprovided to cover identified capacity gaps, and is linked to improved \n34\nefficiency in line with Assembly Government targets.  The plans must \nbe agreed by health communities, which helps ensure they link with local \ncommissioning strategies, and must show how those health communities \n35\nwill move towards the waiting times targets on a month by month basis.  \nIn June 2006, all health communities had agreed their Local Delivery \nPlans with the Assembly Government, with the exception of Cardiff and \n36\nVale NHS Trust. \n16. Mrs Lloyd emphasised that, as part of the Assembly Government’s focus \non waiting times, the performance management system had been \nimproved and, in pursuing improved performance, the service had risen \n                                            \n34\n Paragraph 250; AGW report paragraph 1.19 \n35\n Paragraph 178; AGW report paragraph 1.19  \n36\n Paragraphs 239 and 249 \n  \n37\nfantastically well to the challenge of reducing waiting times.  She \nhighlighted in particular, the importance of the Delivery and Support Unit, \nwhich provides support to NHS organisations in improving performance, \nand takes a more active interventionist role where organisations are not \n38\nmeeting performance targets. \n17. Mrs Lloyd said that the Assembly Government had not left the delivery of \nimproved waiting times to chance, describing the Assembly \n39\nGovernment’s performance targets as “must do targets”.  She told us \nthat if organisations fail to deliver their targets they will be financially \npenalised, and said that two trusts had been penalised in 2005 because \nthey failed to meet their targets without good reason.  Mrs Lloyd told us \nthat she gets a report each month showing individual organisations’ \nperformance against targets.  She also highlighted that, where there \nwere problems with performance, monitoring would be more intensive, \nand gave as an example Swansea NHS Trust where the Delivery and \nSupport Unit monitored performance on a daily basis at the end of \n40\n2005.  Mr Hill-Tout’s note shows how this intervention focused on \nensuring patients were treated in turn, helping to tackle long tails in the \nwaiting list, and ultimately, contributing to Swansea meeting the twelve \n41\nmonth target in April 2006.  The performance management \narrangements also emphasise the accountability of senior management, \nwith Chief Executives required to submit written reports for each patient \n42\nwho breaches the waiting times target. \n18. We are pleased that there is now a system of longer term sustainable \nfunding, designed to support the more strategic approach to reducing \n43\nwaiting times.  The Auditor General’s report describes the various data \ntools that have been used to identify and analyse demand, capacity and \nthe gaps that need to be funded in order to deliver the Access 2009 \n                                            \n37\n Paragraphs 177 and179 \n38\n Paragraph 177 \n39\n Paragraphs 177 and  244 \n40\n Paragraph 244 \n41\n Annex B \n42\n Paragraphs 178, and 244 \n43\n Paragraph 176 \n  \n44\ntargets.  Mrs Lloyd explained how these modelling tools had been used \nto arrive at an overall figure for the Access 2009 project of £80 million \nper year, as well as to identify the required funding for individual Local \n45\nDelivery Plans.  Mrs Lloyd informed us that, ultimately, she would not \nknow the success of this modelling until 2009, but stressed that there \nwould be close monitoring in the interim and that all but one organisation \n46\nhad signed off their Local Delivery Plan. \nRegional variations have reduced, but remain a concern  \n19. The Auditor General’s report shows that there remains large variation \nbetween Local Health Board areas in the number of patients waiting \n47\nmore than 6 months per head of population.  Although the extent of the \nvariation is reducing, we remain concerned at the clear difference \nbetween waiting times in the north and the south of Wales, with relatively \nmore patients in the south waiting over six months.  We note Mrs Lloyd’s \nobservation that this degree of regional variation will be addressed and \neliminated as part of the wider objective of ensuring equality of access, \n48\ntreatment and opportunity. \n20. We agree with Mrs Lloyd that these regional variations can be attributed \nlargely to the effectiveness of the provider and the commissioner, and \nendorse Mr Hill-Tout’s view that variation in efficiency is \n49\ncounterproductive.  Particular variations between organisations and \nareas were reported in respect of: \n50\na. cancelled operations; \n51\nb. delayed transfers of care;   \n52\nc. use of day surgery; and \n                                            \n44\n AGW report, paragraph 1.27 and Figure 9  \n45\n Paragraphs 176 and 249 \n46\n Paragraph 249 \n47\n AGW report, paragraph 1.2 and Figures 3 and 4 \n48\n Paragraph 189 \n49\n Paragraphs 189 and 215 \n50\n Paragraph 215; AGW report paragraph 1.11 \n51\n AGW report, paragraph 1.15 \n52\n Paragraphs 207 to 209 \n  \nd.  pre-operative assessment, which can impact on cancellation \n53\nrates.   \n21. These variations in performance lead to the regional variations in access \ndescribed in paragraph 18, above.  Mrs Lloyd said that that the north \nWales organisations seem to manage appropriately but health \ncommunities along the south Wales coast – Swansea, Cardiff and Gwent \n- have to move the furthest in changing their practice and have the \n54\nbiggest demands made of them.  We therefore expect that improving \nperformance in the south coast organisations will be a priority although, \nas Mrs Lloyd pointed out, organisations in north Wales still need to be \n55\nmonitored.  Mrs Lloyd assured us that regional variations will be \neliminated by 2009, because all organisations will reach the level of the \n56\nbest.  We support the principle that patients should have equitable \naccess to healthcare, but we recognise that local organisations may set \ntheir own priorities, and that some regional variation is likely to remain \nwhere local organisations perform better than the maximum waiting \ntimes targets. \nCareful management of known risks is required to \ndeliver and sustain ongoing reductions in waiting \ntimes \n22. The Assembly Government’s Access 2009 target, that by December \n2009 no patient will wait more than 26 weeks from referral to treatment, \n57\nis ambitious and challenging.  Mrs Lloyd told us that, in seeking to \ndeliver the target, the Assembly Government had to risk assess the \nmajor challenges.  She said that the Access 2009 project identified a \nnumber of risks, and that action is being taken to ensure that each risk is \nmanaged.  She also highlighted that the Assembly Government is \n                                            \n53\n Paragraph 231 \n54\n Paragraph 206 \n55\n Paragraph 206 \n56\n Paragraph 189 \n57\n Paragraph 241;AGW report paragraph 2.1 \n  \nworking to share good practice with colleagues in England, where an 18 \n58\nweek patient pathway target is in place for 2008. \nDiagnostics and therapies are a major concern \n23. Mrs Lloyd told us that, in her opinion, diagnostics and therapies waits \nwere “the biggest problem” and that she had “major concerns” about this \n59\narea.  She said that Wales was ahead of other UK countries, in being \nthe first to publish data on diagnostics and therapies, although this was \nsubject to validation as part of the Access 2009 project.  We are very \nconcerned that there are some extremely long diagnostic and therapy \n60\nwaits in Wales.  The Auditor General’s report shows that, in February \n2006, 5,000 patients (5 per cent of the total waiting) waiting for \ndiagnostic or therapy services had been waiting more than 60 weeks.  It \nalso shows particular problems with podiatry, where a quarter of patients \n61\nhad waited more than 60 weeks.  These long waiting times for \ndiagnostics and therapies clearly pose a major risk in seeking to deliver a \nwaiting times target of 26 weeks from referral to treatment, that includes \nwaiting times for diagnostics and therapies.  We note Mrs Lloyd’s \nobservation that long waits for diagnostic and therapies were not \nuniversally spread throughout Wales, and take this as further evidence of \nthe variations in performance and outcome that need to be eradicated \n62\n(as considered in paragraphs 19 to 21, above). \n24. Mrs Lloyd told us that the Assembly Government was inviting \norganisations to submit proposals for an increase or improvement in \ndiagnostic therapy equipment, but that there were some major problems \n63\nwith having sufficient staff to use the equipment.  She highlighted a \nshortage of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists, \nparticularly those that can speak Welsh.  She said that she is looking to \ndevelop more creative placements, so that staff with particular skills are \nencouraged to stay in those areas where there is a scarcity.  She also \n                                            \n58\n Paragraphs 241 and 261 \n59\n Paragraph 269 \n60\n Paragraph 268 \n61\n AGW report, paragraph 2.8 \n62\n Paragraph 269 \n63\n Paragraph 270 \n  \nsaid that a workforce development unit had been set up in the National \nLeadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare to take forward \n64\nworkforce redesign. \n25. We note that the Assembly Government is considering introducing a \nsecond offer scheme for diagnostics, following the model used to offer \npatients inpatient treatments at an alternative provider where they are at \nrisk of breaching the target.  Mrs Lloyd told us that this kind of approach \n65\nis short term and that a sustainable solution would be better.  A second \noffer scheme for diagnostics could be appropriate for some areas and \nspecialties to address the significant backlog of patients currently \nexperiencing extremely long waits.  However, it would need to be part of \na clear strategy for delivering sustainable improvements in efficiency and \nsecure value for money from the provider organisations through good \ncontracting. \nRedesigning the patient pathway requires changes in the \nmanagement of waiting times \n26. As part of the Access 2009 project, the patient’s journey through the \nvarious stages from referral to treatment will be redesigned, with new \n \ndefinitions clarifying who is counted and when the clock starts and stops.\n66\n  Mr Hill-Tout explained that there is currently a system of \n“suspensions”, where the clock stops for patients when they are unable \nto have their operation for clinical or social reasons.  He told that the \nAccess 2009 project was intended to remove the focus on suspensions \n67\nand remove them from the system.  The Auditor General’s report says \nthat suspensions will be replaced by a system of ‘tolerances’ whereby \ntrusts are allowed a certain tolerance of patients whose journey lasts \nover 26 weeks.  Local Health Boards will be responsible for ensuring that \n68\nall of these tolerances are appropriate. \n                                            \n64\n Paragraphs 270, 277, 278, 282 and 283 \n65\n Paragraphs 269 and 275 \n66\n AGW report, paragraph 2.4 \n67\n Paragraph 182 \n68\n AGW report, paragraph 2.4 \n  \n27. The Auditor General’s report says that new data definitions combined \nwith sustained pressure to deliver targets increases the risk of \n69\ninappropriate data manipulation.  Mrs Lloyd told us that the Assembly \nGovernment had accepted the Auditor General’s recommendation and \n70 \nwill commission a baseline verification of Trusts waiting lists.  Mr Hill-\nTout told us this would be carried out as part of the Access 2009 project.  \nHe also added that in England there was an annual verification of waiting \n71\nlist data, but that in Wales spot-checking may be more appropriate.  \n28. As well as measurement and definition, redesigning the patient pathway \ninvolves changes to the way in which NHS services are configured and \ndelivered.  These changes will require significant modernisation and \ninnovation, but Mrs Lloyd told us that the local delivery plans for Access \n72\n2009 had low scores for modernisation.  Mrs Lloyd told us that, in order \nto address this as part of the Access 2009 project, three trusts had been \nfunded as “early adopters” to take on board the modernisation of three \nspecialities, with each focusing on two different specialities from the \nother early adopters, but all focusing on orthopaedics.  We were very \nencouraged to hear that four other trusts have also volunteered to act as \n73\nearly adopters even though they are not funded.  Mrs Lloyd said that \nthe experience of those “early adopter” organisations is being shared \nacross the NHS and is also underpinned by modernisation assessments \n74\nby the National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare.  We \nexpect that the next round of Local Delivery Plans will reflect this shared \nlearning and include sufficient innovation and modernisation to deliver \nongoing reductions in waiting times. \n29. Mr Hill-Tout described one of the key findings from the early adopters in \nrelation to waiting times for diagnostic services.  He said it was possible \nthat diagnostic waits would run parallel to outpatient waits, so that \npatients will undergo diagnostic tests before their first outpatient \n                                            \n69\n AGW report, paragraph 2.5 \n70\n Paragraph 257; AGW report page 4 \n71\n Paragraph 261 \n72\n Paragraph 255 \n73\n Paragraph 263 \n74\n Paragraph 264; AGW report Figure 8 \n  \n75\nappointment.  The Auditor General’s report says that the early adopters \nreported that 60 per cent of the total patient journey involved waits for \n76\ntests or for the next part of the pathway to commence.  Providing \ndiagnostics parallel to outpatients therefore seems to us to be a very \nsensible option, if it is carried out on the basis of the best clinical practice \nand with the support of patients. \nNHS reconfiguration may disrupt progress \n30. As part of the Assembly Government’s Designed for Life strategy, \nRegional Offices are required to produce plans for reconfiguration of \n77\nNHS services.  Mrs Lloyd told us that this reconfiguration will not be \nallowed to adversely affect waiting times in Wales.  She said that NHS \nreconfiguration and the achievement of shorter waiting times could not \nbe viewed separately because redesigning the healthcare system should \nsupport shorter waiting times.  She told us that the Assembly \nGovernment was examining the proposals being submitted by NHS \norganisations in terms of their capacity and sustainability.  In particular, it \nwas looking at detailed modelling to ensure that reconfiguration improves \nefficiency and access for individual populations.  She described the \n78 79\nexample of telehealth and telemedicine in north Wales, which was \n80\nproviding greater access for patients. \n31. Although we recognise that reconfiguration is designed to help improve \nwaiting times, the risk remains that uncertainty caused by extensive \nchange will temporarily disrupt progress.  This uncertainty applies to \nNHS staff as well as patients, who are understandably concerned about \nextensive changes to their local NHS services.  This risk will need to be \naddressed through careful change management, and dialogue with staff \nand communities. \n                                            \n75\n Paragraph 271 \n76\n AGW report, paragraph 2.6 \n77\n AGW report, paragraph 2.9 \n78\n Telehealth involves using communications technology to enable doctors to remotely \nmonitor patients from their homes \n79\n Telemedicine involves using video conferencing to enable patients to attend their local \ncommunity hospital to be diagnosed, or advised, by consultants based in the acute hospital \n80\n Paragraph 281 \n  \nChanges in demand could compromise the delivery of \nimproved waiting times \n32. Long waiting times can act as a damper on demand, with GPs and \npatients choosing not to refer because they anticipate long waits, or \nopting for treatment in the private sector instead.  There is a risk that \nlower waiting times might release latent demand, putting pressure on the \n81\ndelivery of targets.  Mrs Lloyd told us that the Assembly Government is \naware of this risk and, to date, it appears that there has been no surge in \ndemand.  However, Mrs Lloyd told us that the Assembly Government will \ncontinue to keep a close eye on levels of demand because it has been \n82\nan important factor in designing the Access 2009 project. \n33. A major pandemic would pose a particularly significant risk to the \ndelivery of ongoing reductions in waiting times for patients.  Mrs Lloyd \nreported the Chief Medical Officer’s view that, although he could not \npredict when a pandemic would occur, he was sure one would happen.  \nMrs Lloyd told us that in such circumstances the Welsh Assembly \nGovernment would have to take a judgement on whether to suspend the \nwaiting times target, because the first priority would have to be managing \n83\ncritically ill patients. \nShort-term financial pressures could compromise long-term \nchange \n34. The NHS in Wales currently faces significant financial pressures, with a \n84\nnumber of organisations running deficits.  Mrs Lloyd told us that she \nthought trusts would be sufficiently focused on delivering the long-term \nstrategic changes needed to deliver ongoing reductions in waiting times, \ndespite short-term financial pressures.  She said that the Assembly \nGovernment is having pointed conversations with organisations about \nthe need to modernise, and ensure that short-term cuts do not defeat \ntheir long-term objective.  We agree with Mrs Lloyd that the Assembly \nGovernment must have a constructive discussion with organisations \n                                            \n81\n AGW report, paragraph 2.10 \n82\n Paragraph 285 \n83\n Paragraph 287 \n84\n AGW report, paragraph 2.12 \n  \nabout the pressure they are under and to ensure that short term actions \n85\ndo not undermine the longer term benefits to patients. \nClinical engagement is crucial \n35. Mrs Lloyd told us that clinical engagement is absolutely crucial to the \nongoing delivery of lower waiting times for patients, and that without the \nexpertise of clinicians, local delivery plans will not be delivered \neffectively.  Mrs Lloyd recognised that the full engagement of clinicians in \nmanagement and accountability for the delivery of services has not been \nas well advanced as it has in England, although she said that it has \nimproved enormously.  She also recognised the impact of harnessing the \nenthusiasm and innovative ideas of the really excellent clinicians in \n86\nWales. \n36. In our previous report on NHS Waiting Times, we recommended that \nlocal organisations should be involved in setting their own performance \n87\ntargets and that these should be agreed and owned by clinical staff.  It \ntherefore causes us some concern to hear Mrs Lloyd say that a “whole \nraft” of performance indicators had been “imposed on the service”.  \nDespite Mrs Lloyd’s view that the service had risen fantastically well to \nthe challenge set out by those indicators, we believe that clinical \nownership and engagement with performance indicators and targets is \n88\ncrucial.  We note that the project plan for Access 2009 identifies clinical \n89\nengagement as a risk, and we expect that, in managing this risk, \nclinicians will be actively involved in identifying and agreeing key \nperformance targets and indicators. \n37. We asked Mrs Lloyd whether there was a perverse incentive for some \nconsultants to keep their waiting times long, in order to attract more \n90\nprivate sector work.  Mrs Lloyd told us she was aware of the impact of \n                                            \n85\n Paragraph 255 \n86\n Paragraphs 244 and 246 \n87\n Audit Committee Report, NHS Waiting Times in Wales (May 2005) recommendation 3 \n88\n Paragraph 179 \n89\n AGW report, paragraph 2.13 \n90\n Paragraph 291 \n  \n91 \nlong waiting times on private practice.  Mr Hill-Tout said that, in terms \nof private practice, the numbers are very small, and the extent to which \nconsultants work outside the NHS hospitals is fairly limited.  He also said \nthat by engaging with clinicians on the management of waiting times and \nmeasures such as pooling waiting lists, the NHS can offer a better \nservice to patients; thereby reducing the perceived need to use the \n92\nprivate sector. \n38. Mrs Lloyd told us that Wales is the only country monitoring, in an open \n93\nway, the consequences of the consultant contract on their workload.  \nTrusts can use this monitoring data on the workload carried by individual \nclinicians to review job plans and ensure they are getting a fair deal from \n94\nclinicians.  Whilst we are concerned at the existence of a perverse \nincentive for consultants to resist change and best practice in order to \ngenerate private sector work, we would endorse Mrs Lloyd’s view that \nclinicians work very hard, and that the vast majority give far more than a \n95\nday’s work. \n                                            \n91\n Paragraph 292 \n92\n Paragraph 294 \n93\n Paragraph 292 \n94\n Paragraph 296 \n95\n Paragraph 296 \n   \n \nAnnex A \n \n \n \n \n \nCynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru \nY Pwyllgor Archwilio \n \nThe National Assembly for Wales \nThe Audit Committee \nDydd Iau, 6 Gorffennaf 2006 \nThursday, 6 July 2006 10/07/2006 \n \n \nCofnodir y trafodion hyn yn yr iaith y llefarwyd hwy ynddi yn y pwyllgor.

We will now look at the follow-up report on \nnational health service waiting times. Just over a year ago, the committee held three \nevidence-taking sessions on NHS waiting times in Wales. In May 2005, we published \na highly critical report and concluded that waiting times for Welsh patients were too \nlong. We made 13 separate recommendations, aimed at encouraging the Assembly \nGovernment and local healthcare organisations to take a longer term, more strategic \napproach to tackling NHS waiting times and their causes. \n \n[174] Today’s update report, provided by the auditor general, enables us to examine \nthe progress made by the Welsh Assembly Government in response to those \nrecommendations. We will all be pleased to note the positive progress that is being \nmade in reducing long waits and addressing the underlying causes in a clear and \nstrategic context. I hope that we can focus positively on how this progress can be \nsustained to deliver the challenging new 26-week waiting target by December 2009. \n \n[175] Mrs Lloyd, if we look first at paragraph 1.1 and figures 1 and 2, in your \nopinion, what have been the main reasons for the welcome reductions in long waiting \ntimes for patients? \n \n[176] Ms Lloyd: Primarily, the focus on the importance of achieving these targets, \nboth in relation to the benefits to the health of the population and ensuring that we \nhave a more appropriate response to managing people who are waiting for \nintervention and elective care. The Cabinet decided to invest on a three-year basis—\nbecause it only has three-year financial cycles, as you know—to improve the waiting \ntimes in Wales and, as part of that, to look at the role that waiting times and the \nmanagement of elective care played in the whole of the system of healthcare in \nWales. So, the £80 million that we receive per year has allowed us to have significant \ndiscussions with the NHS over a three-year period to ascertain exactly how it will \nmake the improvements that are so necessary.  \n \n[177] We did not just leave it to chance, either. The performance management \nsystem has been improved as well. We put into place a delivery and support unit, \nwhich has two functions. The first is to go into those organisations where help is \nneeded—if they need to have their lists reassessed or their processes reassessed, a \nsuite of experts from the unit will go in to do that, or it will undertake analyses of \nprecisely what is wrong with the system in any organisation for the Minister and our \ndepartment, and will stay with that organisation, giving it a weekly analysis of its \nperformance until it starts to improve. There is a lot of training, education, \ncommitment and involvement engaged there. So, we set that up. The unit currently \nmanages what we call the Access 2009 project, so, it is taking a main role in that. It \nalso operates a suite of intervention protocols. If the Minister decides that the \nperformance of an individual organisation is insufficient, he will send the unit in and \nit will not come out until he is happy for it to come out. \n \n[178] We have also ensured that there is much tighter management by trusts of their \n 310/07/2006 \nwaiting lists and times. They have been validated and externally reviewed to ensure \nthat their validation has been correct. We have a number of targets around that \nvalidation, namely, how many people are on the suspended list and why they are \nthere. We do not expect more than 5 per cent of any list to be suspended at any one \ntime. They have been asked to produce local delivery plans for precisely how they are \ngoing to manage to move towards these targets on a month-by-month basis. If there \nare breaches, then the chief executive must submit an individual report per patient on \nwhy the person breached. That has cleared out a lot of sub-optimal practice and \nadministrative failures in the system, which was counting people who were not \nbreaching as breaching. So, the whole system has been tightened up and that has been \ngood.  \n \n[179] We have also had to examine the other factors affecting waiting times, \nnamely, the fact that elective care is limited because of emergency access and what \nwe are going to do about that, diversion schemes and demand-management schemes \nand all those sorts of things. There has been a whole raft of performance indicators \nthat have been imposed on the service and the service has risen fantastically well to \nthe challenge of reducing waiting times in Wales. \n \n[180] Janet Davies: So, in that case, do you feel that these published figures are \nrobust? I should say to you at this point that someone came to me in May this year \nwho was told that she had to wait over 18 months to get a scan and another 18 months \nto have in-patient treatment for a very severe condition. After I took the case up with \nthe trust and the Minister, she is now having the scan next month and an operation in \nSeptember. I was concerned about whether this was a one-off or whether it was a sign \nof a deeper, underlying problem.  \n \n[181] Ms Lloyd: I am glad that there has been a resolution to that individual’s \nproblems. John and I get one-off cases where inappropriate information has been \ngiven to patients, but we are constantly vigilant about our information. Diagnostics is \ndifferent, and I will come back to that if I may. We have a number of patients who are \nsaying that they are being told that they will have to wait far longer than our waiting \ntimes and yet they are not being reported in. We follow up each and every one of \nthose concerns. On the wider question of the validation of these lists, we have taken \naction on those, but we are looking to have an independent source of scrutiny of the \nlists to make sure that we are quite clear that these are as clean as is possible.  \n \n[182] Mr Hill-Tout: Just to add to that, there are also issues around the way in \nwhich lists are currently managed. If a patient reports to you that he or she has been \non the list longer than the maximum wait time, when we have examined those \nsituations, often it is because the patient at some time has been suspended. So, the \npatients themselves may have been suspended because they have cancelled an \nappointment or have been unable to attend an operation, or their clinician has \nsuspended them for medical reasons, and therefore, for them, the clock has stopped. \nHowever, they have an understanding that they have been on the waiting list for that \nlong. As part of the 2009 strategy, our strategy is to remove this focus on suspensions \nand get those out of the system, because I think they are a source of confusion. They \nare necessary at the moment, because you have to stop the clock if the patient is not \ncapable, for example, or well enough to have the procedure, but they can cause \nconfusion in the minds of some patients.  \n 410/07/2006 \n \n[183] Ms Lloyd: However, no-one should be told that they have to wait longer than \nthe access target.  \n \n[184] Janet Davies: And this, of course, was after a six-month wait for a first \nappointment. Thank you very much for that. Christine Gwyther is going to continue.  \n \n[185] Christine Gwyther: Speaking from my experience of casework, people are \nstill being told that they will have to wait more than 18 months. This is not an isolated \ncase and we have to be very vigilant in our own areas and, obviously, you do as well. \nI refer you to figures 1 and 2, which show the rate at which waiting times have been \ncoming down, and they look very encouraging. I am pleased to see that the line is \nmuch further down now than it was a few years ago. However, the line does not go in \na straight trajectory; it is wiggly, which shows that trusts are using one-off measures \nat various times—I guess at the end of the financial year—to try to meet their targets. \nHow confident are you that the recent lower figures will not rise again as trusts do not \nuse these one-off measures to reduce the waiting times? \n \n[186] Ms Lloyd: We have asked for local delivery plans from all organisations, and \nthey have been scrutinised rigorously. All but one has been signed off, and we believe \nthat we will probably sign the last one off very shortly; there has been a bit of a \ndispute about that one. We are also very mindful of the bounce that occurs every year \nin April and May, and so we were particularly relieved—because there is three-year \nfunding, and because we have been dealing with three-year analyses of how they meet \nthese targets—when we had the May figures, to see that this bounce had not occurred. \nThere had been a slight rise in out-patients waiting over 12 months, but most of those \nwere for Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust dermatology services, where there is a dispute \ngoing on, which we are trying to resolve, between the trust and its local health boards \nabout its long-term delivery plan. We hope to be able to resolve that quickly. That \naccounted for the vast majority of the increase. \n \n[187] Month by month, the delivery and support unit has been rigorously looking at \nwhat the projections for each organisation would be, how many patients the \norganisations would be able to see, and what the demand was like; we now collect GP \nreferral figures and we are able to feed back to GPs on the quality of their referral, to \nensure that we do not have bounces. We put in sustainable solutions to the \nmanagement of waiting times, and the management of elective capacity. \n \n[188] Christine Gwyther: Figures 3 and 4 deal with regional variation. If I were a \nnorth Wales AM, I might be slightly more relaxed about this, because waiting times \nare far lower in the north than they are in south and mid Wales. How soon will it be \nbefore what could be seen as this postcode lottery is eliminated? \n \n[189] Ms Lloyd: It will be eliminated by the time that we get to 2009, because \neveryone has to get down to the best. The variations that you can see over those two \nyears are reducing; we would expect to see a further reduction, because one of the \nmain drivers for Government is the equality of access and treatment, and \nopportunities. The variances can be put down to the effectiveness of the provider and \nthe effectiveness of the commissioning. We have urged the organisations to address \nthese regional variations. You can see from figure 3, in particular, the benefit of the \n 510/07/2006 \naction that has been taken by organisations to redress the balance. Therefore, they will \nbe eliminated—we hope that they will be eliminated before we get to 2009. We will \nkeep our eye on the commissioning projects from each of the LHBs, or the regional \nconsortia, to eliminate this variance that exists now. \n \n[190] Christine Gwyther: In figure 4, I am pleased to see that most of the waiting \ntimes for in-patient day-case treatments have reduced significantly. However, in \nSwansea, it has risen alarmingly. Could you give us the reason for that? \n \n[191] Mr Hill-Tout: This figure shows the number of people waiting more than six \nmonths. Therefore, in effect, what you see there is that, as the trust has focused on its \nlong waiters, it is condensing its waiting lists, so that the numbers of people are being \nreduced, but it is focused on the tail end of the list. You therefore see an increase in \nthe lower parts of the list, as we are encouraging them to treat patients from the back \nof the list; that is what has occurred there. However, Swansea NHS Trust is achieving \nall of its targets. Therefore, although it is an issue, the trust is achieving its targets \nnow, and we will continue to monitor that. \n \n[192] Christine Gwyther: But why is Swansea so markedly different? All trusts \nmust surely be concentrating on the back end of their waiting lists first. Why is there \nsuch a huge difference in Swansea? \n \n[193] Mr Hill-Tout: In the initial part of the period, Swansea was less adept, shall \nwe say, at that concentration. You will see from the report that it had started that \nexercise of pulling people from the back of the list much later on; in fact, we \nfinancially penalised it as a consequence. Therefore, what we see there is that the trust \nhas made significant improvements, but it still has more to do in how it manages its \nlist. As Mrs Lloyd described, the delivery and support unit is working with that trust, \nand has been for the last 12 months, and will continue to do so, so that this sort of \nanomaly is eradicated. \n \n[194] Jocelyn Davies: On Swansea, I believe that we have been told before that it \ndoes all the plastic surgery for the whole of Wales. \n \n[195] Mr Hill-Tout: Almost all. \n \n[196] Jocelyn Davies: Well, the surgery for all of south Wales, then. A very few \npeople have been waiting a very long time. Does that impact on these figures? \n \n[197] Mr Hill-Tout: It could do. It is certainly a specialist centre. It treats all the \nplastic surgery cases for south and mid Wales. People from the north flow into \nEngland for their plastic surgery. It could be that, and it does have other specialist \nservices, such as neurosurgery, which might have an impact on this. If you would like \nme to, I could do a further examination of that and give you a written response.  \n \n[198] Jocelyn Davies: If they are carrying out specialist services and there are very \nlong waits for that and those patients obviously come from all over Wales—I think \nthat they do obesity surgery there as well, do they not? \n \n[199] Ms Lloyd: Yes, they do. \n 610/07/2006 \n \n[200] Jocelyn Davies: Do you think that you could give us a note on that?  \n \n[201] Mr Hill-Tout: I can give you a note on Swansea. \n \n[202] Jocelyn Davies: We may find that there are some patients who have been \nwaiting a very long time for specialist surgery at Swansea. \n \n[203] Ms Lloyd: That is why Swansea was put under special measures. It had the \ndeliver and support unit with it the whole of last year to make sure that it started to \nmanage its lists appropriately. \n \n[204] Christine Gwyther: Finally, Chair, is there a difference in management \nbetween north Wales and the rest of Wales, whereby north Wales might be using \nmore day surgery? It might be better at dealing with delayed transfers of care and its \nbed capacity might be better.  \n \n[205] Ms Lloyd: It is quite difficult to give a very definitive answer to that, because \nthe performance of all these organisations is different. You will know that, in the \nservice and financial framework target set by the Minister last year, the Minister \nincluded a number of efficiency measures, including average lengths of stay, delayed \ntransfers, cancelled operations and day-case rates, and all organisations in Wales were \ngiven a target that they had to meet. Some of them met that target and some did not, \nand some of the targets were very specific. I get a report at the end of each month, \nshowing precisely where individual organisations are in terms of their effectiveness in \nmeeting these targets.  \n \n[206] On the whole, the north Wales organisations seem to manage appropriately, \nbut that does not mean that you take your eye off them, because they can have swings \nduring the year. The main pressures that we have found are all along the south Wales \ncoast, including Swansea, Cardiff and Gwent. They have the biggest demands made \nof them and they have to move the furthest in changing their practice. We are working \nconstructively with them on how they might do that. The establishment of the two \nelective centres in Gwent and Cardiff will help enormously, in that they will have \nelective capacity that is really ring-fenced and that no-one will be able to get into, \nunless they are elective. Also of enormous help will be some of the changes in \npractice that they have promoted over the last year.  \n \n[207] Some, however, were finding that with the best will in the world, their \naccommodation was such that their ability to provide day-case surgery was really \nhampered. So, we have been investing in that as part of the local delivery plans. We \nhave been asking them for their capital programmes to aid them in meeting some of \nthese targets. I think that we have had about 65 schemes in, which we are pursuing, as \npart of the local delivery plans, to enable them to meet the day-case targets better. \nSome of them, through no fault of their own, just could not do it because they did not \nhave the set up. However, the performance is variable and is published on a quarterly \nbasis and we would be happy to circulate that to you. \n[208] Christine Gwyther: I can accept that some hospitals might not be designed in \nsuch a way that makes day surgery easy. However, I submitted a written question to \nthe Minister last week on day surgery at Withybush Hospital in Pembrokeshire and \n 710/07/2006 \nthe figures for 2004-05 were better than the figures for 2005-06. Therefore, clearly, it \nhas retrenched in its efforts to increase day surgery. Can you explain how that sort of \nthing can happen? \n \n[209] Ms Lloyd: Withybush is one of the hospitals that has a real problem in trying \nto provide good quality day-case facilities, although it depends which day case you \nare looking at. It has failed on its arthroscopies and it has managed its bunions fine \nand its cataracts and it is not too bad on the hysteroscopies. So, in some areas, it has \ndone okay and exactly what is right but, in other areas, it has failed, and we are \npursuing that with it. It might be that the equipment is insufficient and that is what the \ndelivery and support unit will follow through with it when we get these results. \n \n[210] Janet Davies: We will turn to address the causes of long waits.  \n \n[211] Mark Isherwood: I refer to paragraphs 1.3 to 1.15 and the underlying causes. \nWhy do you think that the rate of reductions in cancelled operations effectively stalled \nand actually slightly increased over the year in question, that is, 2005-06? \n \n[212] Ms Lloyd: Over the last three years, the rate of cancelled operations has \ngenerally increased in that last quarter. What we have found is that that denotes the \npressure on the whole system. You tend to get more emergency admissions and, \ntherefore, you cannot get so many patients through. It is also a symptom of planning \nthroughout the whole year, which is why we have tried to encourage hospitals to plan \nmore effectively and not to expect all the patients to come in in January.  \n \n[213] However, if you look at what has happened subsequently, it did go up in \nMarch, to 3,614 cancellations, but it dropped in April to 2,523 cancelled operations, \nwhich is the best that we have had for the last five years. We shall be tracking this \nvery carefully to see that this downward trend continues. We are also looking at why \noperations have been cancelled and it is still quite a concern to me that so many of \nthese operations—two fifths, approximately—are cancelled by the patient. Is it \nbecause we have not given the patient long enough to think about what is going to \nhappen to them? Is it because we have not consulted them effectively enough on when \nthe operation may or may not take place? That is work that the delivery and support \nunit is doing for us. If you look at the non-clinical reasons for hospitals cancelling, \nyou will see that, again, those are still too high. That is another two fifths, and some \nof that is about the processes that organisations use. I find it unacceptable for \noperations to be cancelled because the consultant is on leave, when consultants have \nto give six weeks’ notice. That should be completely avoidable. \n \n[214] Hospital cancellations for clinical reasons are valid, obviously. You must have \ngood pre-assessment and it is at that stage that you might find that an operation is \ncancelled, but we have to do far more work on the reasons why patients cancel and \nthe non-clinical issues, because we simply have to drive the number of cancelled \noperations down. It is such a waste of resource and it causes such frustration, both for \nthe staff and, more importantly, for the patient.  \n \n[215] Mr Hill-Tout: Just to add to that, if I may, the issue really is about reducing \nthe differences in efficiency between trusts. What is not acceptable is if one trust is \nreturning, because of efficiency reasons, a poorer cancellation rate than a neighbour. \n 810/07/2006 \nThat is why, if you look on page 11, where the auditor general has recounted the \nefficiency targets, the Minister has indicated, in this year’s targets set for the NHS, \nfive key efficiency targets that everybody has to hit. So the intention of that is to get, \nif you like, everybody improving so that we do not have so much variation in \nefficiency, which is counterproductive.  \n \n[216] Mark Isherwood: Following on from a previous point, we see a mixed \npattern, where some seem to be getting worse and some seem to be getting better, and \nthat is consolidating on a middle position, which is, possibly, well below the best \nbeing achieved previously. Are you confident that the April figure will be reproduced, \nor is it too early to say that it will continue to improve? If not, what further actions \ncan be taken to reduce cancellations? \n \n[217] Ms Lloyd: It is too early to say at the moment whether we will maintain this \ntrend, because it dips every April or May, but it has not dipped quite as much as this \nbefore. We have put out a good practice guide for elective admissions and elective \nsurgery, and I have also asked the national leadership and innovations organisation to \nundertake a modernisation assessment of each organisation, to ensure that \nmodernisation techniques are embedded within those organisations. They are now \ngetting back their individual scores on how well they have done, and both the \nNational Leadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare and the delivery and \nsupport unit are producing a script for each organisation on the areas in which they \nmust improve and the way in which they might improve. They will continue to work \nwith them during this year to ensure that we drive down cancelled operations, which \nare now part of the service and financial framework, and on which the Minister is \nasking for particular evidence to show an improvement. He is sending the delivery \nand support unit into areas where he does not feel that sufficient progress is being \nmade, and to ensure that we keep a very tight grip on the use of the facilities so that \nwe provide an efficient service, in which people’s operations are not cancelled all the \ntime or they do not have a bed.  \n \n[218] Mark Isherwood: You also talk about rates and the proportion, but do we \nknow if the absolute demand is changing?  \n \n[219] Ms Lloyd: We do indeed. We are producing the GP referral rates, which are \nbeing fed back to each practice. LHBs are being charged with looking critically at \ntheir referral rates to see whether or not they are equivalent to what you would expect \nfrom their population. There are some strange returns at the moment, and we are \nchecking some of the information to ensure that we are not asking them to do \nsomething on the basis of faulty information. It is a major part of the commissioning \nprocess to ensure that the referrals are appropriate, and you will know of the work that \nhas been undertaken in some of the LHBs on a pilot basis to set up referral centres, \nthrough which all referrals from their area will go and be managed. The quality of the \nreferral will be fed back to the individual GP practice to try to ensure that people are \nnot being put into the system, and having to wait for a specialist opinion, when they \nmight have been redirected to somewhere more appropriate at an earlier stage. \nAssociated with the referral systems, we have initiated and paid for some of the LHBs \nto put in diversion schemes so that GP specialists might see patients instead, and they \nare being evaluated. So, a lot of work is being done on managing demand more \neffectively.   \n 910/07/2006 \n \n[220] Mark Isherwood: Right, thank you. The report tells us that measures that \nhave been introduced to address pressures on emergency admissions, but, nonetheless, \nwe are told that the ratio of emergency to elective admissions has remained the same \nfor the last four years. Why do you think that is and when do you expect that the \nmeasures that have been taken will impact on the throughput of elective patients?  \n \n[221] Ms Lloyd: The Minister is about to produce his delivering emergency care \nservices strategy, which looks at the trends that have occurred over the past years and \nthe changes in the way in which people can access emergency care. It tries to \nstreamline the way in which people will access care. At the moment, they can go \nthrough a number of areas—they can go to NHS Direct, the out-of-hours service or \nstraight to their accident and emergency department, and we know that there are large \nnumbers of patients who are completely confused about how to access care when they \nneed it. Most of them will go to the emergency unit. That might be appropriate but it \nmight not, and they may have to wait much longer than necessary and they might \nhave been treated faster had they chosen a different route. So, we are trying in this \nnew system to bring all these sources together so that there is one informed access \npoint, so that people are directed much more effectively to the place where they will \nget the appropriate treatment in a speedy way. \n \n[222] We are also looking at the ambulance service becoming far more of a \nclinically driven service, rather than a transport system, so that paramedics are able, \nmore effectively, to provide front-line services. That seems to be welcomed by the \nunions and the staff at the moment; they are very pleased by some of the reports that \nhave come from England, particularly those developed by a guy called Bradley in \nLondon, who is also helping us, and by Roger Thayne himself. This will be a real \nopportunity to take a step forward in terms of how people access care, to ensure that \npeople are directed appropriately with the right information to the right place. That \nwill be quite an innovation when it comes in, and it has been well-signed-up-to by \nclinicians and—  \n \n[223] Mr Hill-Tout: And by the professional organisations.  \n \n[224] Ms Lloyd: They are very pleased with it.  \n \n[225] Jocelyn Davies: On the point about patient cancellations, it is a large number, \nas you mentioned, Mrs Lloyd. You gave several scenarios for why a patient might \ncancel his or her operation, but how do you know that the patient has not already \npurchased that operation in the private sector, which could be another option? \n \n[226] Ms Lloyd: We do not. \n \n[227] Mr Hill-Tout: It could be one of the reasons. \n \n[228] Ms Lloyd: It could be one of the reasons, but we do not know. There is an \nissue with asking them that.  \n \n[229] Jocelyn Davies: Yes. I think that you have mentioned patient cancellations to \nus before, so when do you think that you might be in a position to discover why? This \n 1010/07/2006 \nis quite a serious problem, so what actions are you taking to discover why it happens, \nso that this does not keep occurring year after year? \n \n[230] Ms Lloyd: The DSU is, at the moment, analysing the reasons why patients \nhave not attended, and the current reasons are that the appointment may be \ninconvenient, they are unfit for surgery, the operation is not wanted, or they just have \nnot turned up. We can do, on a restricted basis, a first sift on these reasons. If it is a \nmatter of the operation not being wanted, we have to have a further investigation, with \nthe patient’s permission, into why he or she did not want it, to ask some relevant \nquestions, without being too intrusive. The DSU is looking at that work for us now.  \n \n[231] Mr Hill-Tout: The key to this—I know that, in paragraph 1.11, it says it, and \nit also says it in the NLIAH guide—is pre-operative assessment. In Wales, not every \ntrust offers pre-operative assessment; they all need to. If they offered for every patient \nto be seen by a nurse or a junior doctor an appropriate period before their surgery, all \nof these questions would be dealt with. As well as the clinical issue, the social issues, \nif you like, such as ‘I have had my surgery elsewhere’, would be communicated. If we \ncan attack that, and improve pre-operative assessment and make it uniform across \nWales, those cancelled operations will fall dramatically in number. That is certainly \nour view, and I think that it is the view of the auditor general; that is where we need to \nfocus our efforts.  \n \n[232] Jocelyn Davies: I have dealt with cases in which patients do not want \noperations, but their families do want the patients to have operations.  \n \n[233] Mark Isherwood: Appendix A refers to Llandough Hospital. When do you \nexpect it to be operational? \n \n[234] Ms Lloyd: I am sorry, I missed that. \n \n[235] Mark Isherwood: Appendix A refers to Llandough Hospital. When do you \nexpect that hospital to be fully operational? \n \n[236] Mr Hill-Tout: This is CAVOC, the Cardiff and Vale orthopaedic centre unit? \n \n[237] Ms Lloyd: Yes. \n \n[238] Mr Hill-Tout: The background to the CAVOC unit is that it is being \nconstructed in two phases. Phase 1 of CAVOC was the creation of a new bed-\ntemplate, operating theatres and some out-patient facilities. In phase 1, the out-patient \nservice is already open and functioning, and that was through a capital scheme funded \nby the Assembly and a revenue contribution of £2.5 million, which the Welsh \nAssembly Government made to the community to get the first phase of CAVOC up \nand running. Out-patients began being seen in that department some eight weeks ago. \n \n[239] Phase 2, which is the in-patient and other aspects of the unit, is not yet open, \nand that is because, effectively, it is part of the local delivery plan for the Cardiff and \nVale community. That community has had the largest share of the £80 million that \nwas made available, but it also has the largest number of patients to be treated. So, the \ncomplexity is in agreeing the level of work that can be dealt with through Cardiff and \n 1110/07/2006 \nVale and through CAVOC. It is the last local delivery plan to be finalised. All the \nothers have been signed off, but Cardiff and the Vale’s local delivery plan has not \nbeen signed off. That work is currently in progress; in fact, we had a meeting \nyesterday with the community. We are optimistic that, once that local delivery plan \nhas been signed off to our satisfaction, the CAVOC unit will go ahead and will be \nopened. At present, stage two is not yet functioning. \n \n[240] Mark Isherwood: I will move on now to paragraphs 1.16 to 1.27, which \ndescribe the introduction of a clearer central strategy within which to improve waiting \ntimes. How confident are you that you have generated sufficient improvements in \nperformance management to ensure the rapid delivery, hopefully, of the strategy in \nhealth communities? \n \n[241] Ms Lloyd: In having to deliver such a challenging target we had to risk assess \nwhat we felt would be the major challenges for us. One of those challenges was being \nable to performance manage this effectively and make sure that there was enough \nsupport for the service to take the steps that were necessary. So, the establishment of \nthe delivery and support unity with automatic intervention, if organisations were \nfailing to meet their profiles, came in. The introduction of breach reports does \nconcentrate the mind; if you have to write a report on every patient who breaches, it is \nan onerous responsibility. There is much site-specific work also taking place \nsupported by NLIAH’s modernisation team and the DSU. We are looking at the \nscores that are applied to how well people manage their waiting lists and we have the \nguide to good practice. We monitor these on a month by month basis. If the Minister \ndecides that he is not satisfied with the progress being made, he can increase the \nintervention. He believes that it is really important that we do not fall behind in this. \nSo, there are a number of risks identified in the work streams for the 2009 project, \nmany of which are outlined in this report and with which we would agree. Action has \nbeen taken on each of those to ensure that the performance management wrapped \naround those is as tight as it can get. We are also working very constructively with the \nEnglish team that is driving the 2008 target to make sure that we share good practice. \n \n[242] Mark Isherwood: I think that performance management has to become \ncultural. How are you managing the change? How are you ensuring that people \nactually identify where they can take ownership for it? \n \n[243] Ms Lloyd: I think that it was interesting; we were at the Health and Social \nServices Committee yesterday at which there was some evidence being given on \ncancer. The consultant at the meeting said, ‘We have all seen your letter about the \ndelivery of the cancer wait standards; it is taken seriously’. If we can get that sort of \nreaction from the clinicians who have to deliver at the end of the day, it is obvious \nthat the trust managers are making sure that their clinical teams are on board with \ndoing this important piece of work. Without them, and without their expert knowledge \nabout how patients might be best served, the delivery plans will not be delivered \neffectively. \n \n[244] The trust chief executives know that if they fail to deliver these targets, which \nare must-do targets—we have to do this. It is being backed by the Cabinet, they have \nprovided extra money to do it and there is a lot of discussion about how it might be \ndone—their organisations will be financially penalised. We did financially penalise \n 1210/07/2006 \ntwo organisations last year for not doing what they set out to do and there was no \ngood reason for that. The whole issue of the delivery of these targets has been raised \nright up the profile of the trusts and their clinical teams. They are monitored on a \nmonthly basis; in fact, if the delivery and support unit is in there, they can be \nmonitoring them on a daily basis, as was the case in Swansea towards the end of last \nyear. It does concentrate the mind when you know that someone is going to ask you, \nat the end of each day, ‘Did you deliver what you set out to do today, and if not, why \nwas that?’. The profile is up. \n \n[245] Mark Isherwood: You are probably aware that, at the BMA conference in \nNorthern Ireland a few days ago, concerns around this sort of area were raised, which \nsuggests that there is a two-way communication issue. How can you take that on \nboard with your English colleagues to ensure that all the horses in the harness are \npointing in the same direction? \n \n[246] Ms Lloyd: Clinical engagement is absolutely crucial. In Wales, we have some \nreally excellent clinicians who have very bright and innovative ideas about how better \nto manage patients. We have to harness their enthusiasm and their ideas. We have had \na number of seminars throughout Wales where clinicians have been only too pleased \nto present the different ways in which patients might be managed for the future. We \nhave to make sure that the good practice is properly spread throughout Wales, which \nis why we had the modernisation audit undertaken, much of which relates to better \nclinical interventions and has been informed by the individuals within Wales about \nbest practice and managing clinical management of patients. The full engagement of \nclinicians in management and accountability for the delivery of services, in the round, \nnot just this, has not been as well advanced in Wales as it probably is in England. I \nthink that they started in England a long time before we did. Nevertheless, it has \nimproved enormously. When I go around, I meet large numbers of very enthusiastic \nclinicians who want their ideas to make a real difference to patients, but we have to \nmake sure that that is universalised throughout Wales. \n \n[247] Janet Davies: Mark, we will have to leave this bit now, because time is \ngetting on and we need to move on to Mick Bates’s questions. I am sorry about that. \n \n[248] Mick Bates: You used the term ‘concentrate the mind’; there is nothing like \nmoney to concentrate the mind. In figure 9, we see your new tools for better planning \nactions and strategies to reduce waiting times for patients. This toolkit was used to \ncalculate the figure of £80 million per year. How confident are you that your \ncalculations are accurate and that £80 million per year is enough to deliver the 2009 \ntarget? \n \n[249] Ms Lloyd: We have done some very detailed modelling about the \nmanagement of this target. I think that you can see that we more than triangulated the \ntechniques that we were using. We were extremely cautious about this before the \nCabinet was advised of the resource, which is why we did not just rely on one \nindividual organisation saying, ‘You will need x to do y’. We tried to ensure that all \nthe bases were covered. Arising from all this work that you see in figure 9, the figure \nwas arrived at. In terms of its success, we will not know whether it is successful until \nwe get to the end of it, but it is being tracked very carefully. However, despite some \ngrumbles here and there, the local delivery plans—apart from one, which is \n 1310/07/2006 \nimminent—have been signed off and people are, to date, delivering this. The amount \nof resources regarded on our risk register has to be there and we have to keep a very \nclose eye on it. \n \n[250] Mr Hill-Tout: Just to supplement that, Chair, I think that the funding is there. \nIt needs to be linked with the efficiency, which is why the efficiency targets are there, \nbecause we have already discussed varied efficiency, and it needs to be linked with \nthe modernisation. With the three things together, we are confident that we will \ndeliver in 2009. \n \n[251] Mick Bates: How confident are you that cross-border information is \ncollectable? \n \n[252] Ms Lloyd: This is a problem. I am in close contact with my colleague, Ian \nCarruthers, on this issue, and I have spoken to him at least three times in the past \nmonth about it and other matters. In England, they only count GP referrals in, whereas \nwe count everyone; no matter where the referral comes from, we count it, and that is \nwhy we found that, at the end of last year, there were 15 breaches, and they were all \npatients waiting for English hospitals to treat them. So, I have raised this with him \nagain. We always knew that we counted differently, because we counted everything \nand everyone. His response at the moment is that, this year, he will be moving from \nthe situation that they have at the moment—you have individual treatments, and that \nis your out-patient waits, and then you are into your diagnostic waits, and then you are \ninto in-patient waits, if necessary—to having a proper patient pathway. So, he will \nchange his collection methodology to having a whole pathway, so, it does not matter \nwhere the referrals come from as they will all be counted. That is important. \n \n[253] The other thing is that I expect local health boards that are transferring patients \nto English hospitals to keep track of those patients. I have been talking to the border \nlocal health boards about how they might better manage those commissioning \ndecisions, because they should be clear that they are their patients and that they \nshould be keeping track of them. We should not be finding that patients are waiting \nfor a very long time for an opinion in England, when they would have received an \nearlier opinion if they had been in Wales. \n \n[254] Mick Bates: I am sure that these cross-border issues will rumble on for a long \ntime. As you are well aware, there are many funding issues that make commissioning \ndifficult across the border. My final point looks to the future. Will trusts be \nsufficiently focused on delivering the long-term strategic changes needed to deliver \nthese targets at a time when they are under intense short-term financial pressures? \n \n[255] Ms Lloyd: I think so, and we are ensuring that, in looking at their local \ndelivery plans, their reconfiguration plans and the financial pressures that they are \nexperiencing, short-termism is not wiping out the long-term game. We are having \nsome pointed conversations with many organisations about this, but they must \nmodernise their services, and most local delivery plans did not get a good score in \nterms of modernisation. They must look at the best use of their resources, and they \nshould not be taking short-term cuts that defeat their long-terms objective. That is one \nof the things that we have to do as a department to ensure that those things are \nbalanced, and we must have a really constructive discussion with them about the \n 1410/07/2006 \npressures that they are under. \n \n[256] Mick Bates: Finally, on the auditor general’s first recommendation, which \ndescribes how the focus on the 29-week target could increase the risk of inappropriate \nactivity, or even the manipulation of data, how do you propose to take forward the \nauditor general’s first recommendation to develop systems to ensure that the data on \nwaiting times are accurate and that local organisations are not manipulating the \nfigures? \n \n[257] Ms Lloyd: We are commissioning a baseline verification, in accordance with \nhis recommendations. \n \n[258] Mick Bates: I am sorry; you are saying that you are going to do that. \n \n[259] Ms Lloyd: Yes. \n \n[260] Mick Bates: When is that work likely to be undertaken? \n \n[261] Mr Hill-Tout: This will be part of the 2009 programme—it has to be. We \nneed the baseline verification, which will be done through the 2009 project team, and \nthen we need to decide how best to monitor that on a regular basis. We will talk to our \naudit colleagues about that, and whether this is spot checking or something else. In \nEngland, as I understand it, a regular survey of all trusts is held on an annual basis. \nWe may decide that, in Wales, we do not need that level of checking, but that we need \nsome level of checking, and we might want to go down the route of spot checking. \nThose decisions must be made, but the 2009 programme will commission the baseline \nverification of the start position, so that we can be clear that we have that and we \nknow the position, and then we can check it. \n \n[262] Jocelyn Davies: Mrs Lloyd, you mentioned the patient pathway earlier, and \nthis report certainly points out that redesigning the patient pathway will need \nsignificant innovation to deliver the 2009 target. However, the local delivery plans \nhave had a low score for innovation. So, will local health communities be able to \ndeliver those changes? Will they rise to the challenge? \n \n[263] Ms Lloyd: You will have noticed that, in the report, mention is made of early \nadopters. We asked for two or three organisations that had come forward to become \nearly adopters of a very different way of delivering care in a particular range of \nspecialities, but specifically orthopaedics, which is a major problem for us, as it is for \nEngland. So, we have been lucky in that several organisations have come forward, \nwhich we have funded as part of the 2009 project, to take on board the modernisation \nof three specialities, and they are all different, except for orthopaedics. However, once \nothers heard about it, they decided to join that programme. Even though they are not \nfunded, four more trusts have joined the programme, including Gwent, which has had \nproblems in the past with managing its waiting lists.  \n \n[264] We are sharing the experience drawn from those organisations with the \nservice, underpinned by the modernisation audit that the National Leadership and \nInnovation Agency for Healthcare has undertaken, to ensure that this innovative \npractice is shared throughout Wales—it has been specifically funded for that purpose.  \n 1510/07/2006 \n \n[265] Jocelyn Davies: The other questions that I wanted to ask have been answered \nalready. \n \n[266] Janet Davies: Thank you, Jocelyn. \n \n[267] Denise Idris Jones: Paragraph 2.7 says that diagnostics and therapies have \npreviously represented a bottleneck for patients, and that, until 2006-07, there have \nbeen no specific targets for diagnostics and therapies. How much of a risk is posed by \nwaiting times for diagnostics and therapies, and what action is being taken to address \nthe long waiting times in these areas? \n \n[268] Ms Lloyd: This is indeed a major problem. Wales is the first of the countries \nto at least publish the data that it has. Of course, that, again, is subject to major \nvalidation, and it is part of the project. However, we are subject to some extremely \nlong diagnostic and therapy service waits in Wales.  \n \n[269] We have looked at where the particular problems are, and how we might \naddress those, again, through this project, as well as at how much investment will be \nneeded to ensure that it becomes firmly embedded as part of the patient pathway in \nthis 2009 project. To my mind, however, the diagnostic and therapy waits, at the \nmoment, are the biggest problem that we have. The out-patients are largely being \ncontrolled as in-patients, but the diagnostic ones, as in England, are the main problem. \nTherefore, we have asked for particular plans from organisations to overcome some of \nthe big bottlenecks that you see. It is not universally spread throughout Wales either; \nsome areas do not seem to be under anything like the same pressure as others, but \nthere are major concerns in my mind about doing this. The delivery and support unit \nis looking at this very critically and liaising with the English team to share good \npractice on what it is doing. We are thinking about whether we have to go for a \nsecond-offer scheme for diagnostics as well.  \n \n[270] We have asked organisations to put forward their proposals for an increase or \nan improvement in their diagnostic therapy equipment, and those are coming through \nto us now, but we have to make sure that we have sufficient staff to use the \nequipment. In speech and language therapy, we really do have a major problem, as we \ndo in physiotherapy, for which we have increased the numbers in training, but it \nnevertheless remains a major problem for us, and it is one of our greatest risks. A \nhuge amount of effort is being applied to this.  \n \n[271] Mr Hill-Tout: Just to add to that, Chair, if I may, the early adopters are taking \nthe view—and this may well be where we end up—that diagnostic waits will be in \nparallel with out-patient waits, so, once a patient has seen a GP, at the point that the \nGP decides to refer to a consultant, there will be a protocol in the pathway that says, \n‘With this condition, this patient needs to have this diagnostic procedure’. So, that \nmust take place in parallel during the time that the patient is being referred to the \nconsultant, otherwise you get staged waits, which we have now. So, that is why the \npathway has to be redesigned, and that will be the final pathway; it will look like \ndiagnostics are coming in parallel, or even before, so that, when the consultant sees \nthe patient, all the test results are available to him or her.  \n \n 1610/07/2006 \n[272] Jocelyn Davies: That makes sense. \n \n[273] Denise Idris Jones: It does make sense, yes.  \n \n[274] The backlog of patients waiting for in-patient and day-case treatment has been \naddressed by purchasing extra activity in the NHS at weekends, or in the private \nsector. Is this a feasible option to increase the availability capacity for diagnostic and \ntherapy services? \n \n[275] Ms Lloyd: We regard the in-patient and out-patient schemes as short term. \nPart of the 2009 project is to build in sustainable capacity, to ensure that demands can \nbe managed sustainably. It could be done on a short-term basis, using those methods, \nbut we are trying to get a sustainable solution to some of these problems. Therefore, \nto overcome short-term requirements, we will be looking with organisations at \nwhether or not that is appropriate. However, basically, we need a long-term solution \nto this. \n \n[276] Denise Idris Jones: Therefore, in a way, we are not training enough speech \ntherapists—is that the problem? \n \n[277] Ms Lloyd: There has been a big dip in the past in training them, as well as in \nretaining them. We have increased the number of therapists in training considerably \nover the last three to four years, so we just have to ensure that they are employed \neffectively. Many of the trainees who are now coming out—and there are issues about \nit, which we are exploring with the service—need almost another year of training and \nsupervision to be able to be self-standing therapists. We are working with the service \non how that might best be achieved, because it is an added pressure for the existing \nqualified staff. \n \n[278] Denise Idris Jones: In my area, there is an extra problem. I was speaking to \nan elderly gentleman on Sunday who had had a stroke, and whose first language was \nWelsh. He was going for speech therapy, but there was no point in doing this if the \nspeech therapist could not speak with him in Welsh. \n \n[279] Ms Lloyd: Exactly. \n \n[280] Denise Idris Jones: Paragraph 1.20 notes that the Welsh Assembly \nGovernment’s regional offices are currently producing plans for the reconfiguration of \nsecondary care, which should help support shorter waiting times. The reconfiguration \nof secondary care services is likely to lead to changes being implemented across NHS \nWales. Might this adversely affect the delivery of the 2009 target? \n \n[281] Ms Lloyd: No, it must not be allowed to. In looking at the proposals that are \ncoming forward—and they are coming forward from the service, and not so much \nfrom us—we are looking at capacity and sustainability within those proposals. We are \nalso looking at what the detailed modelling looks like in terms of the suite of options \nthat are coming forward, to ensure that, if reconfiguration takes place, we are \nimproving the efficiency and access to individual populations. We are also working \nwith LHBs to look at what the community base service is for the future, what that \nlooks like, and how we can improve telehealth and telemedicine so that there is \n 1710/07/2006 \ngreater access. That is being used successfully in north Wales at present—in fact, I do \nnot believe that we could provide some services without it. It is to improve the spread \nof the take-up of those techniques. Therefore, ‘Designed for Life’ and its \nconsequences cannot be seen outside the achieving of good waiting times in Wales—\nthey are all part of the same thing, just as emergency admissions and detox are; it is a \nsystem that is in need of redesigning. \n \n[282] Catherine Thomas: To pick up on the important point that Denise made \nabout speech therapists providing support through the medium of Welsh, this is also a \nparticular problem in Carmarthenshire. What are you doing specifically to address \nthat shortage of speech therapists working through the medium of Welsh? \n \n[283] Ms Lloyd: The trusts produce their workforce plans. As you know, the \nworkforce development unit has now been established in NLIAH to take forward \nworkforce redesign and the commissioning of education and training for our staff. \nCarmarthenshire has acknowledged that it has a problem with the shortage of Welsh-\nspeaking speech therapists, and that is being built into the proposals. We are trying to \nget more creative placements so that staff will be encouraged to stay in those areas \nwhere they are most needed. If they have a particular expertise, we need to provide \ngood quality placements for them, so that they will be encouraged to stay in those \nareas where there is a scarcity. We are tracking the take-up of employment, as we \nhave done for the past year, of people who have scarce skills that are needed. \n \n[284] Leighton Andrews: On paragraphs 2.10 and 2.11, looking at the effects of \nlong waiting times, I note that there is a cap on demand. One of the dangers is that if \nwaiting times reduce substantially, suppressed demand might suddenly flow out. \nWhat is your assessment of that in respect of the 26-week target?  \n \n[285] Ms Lloyd: We have been tracking demand carefully because, at one time, it \nlooked to us as though the number of patients requiring out-patient treatment was \ngoing up steeply. The trends, however, at the moment, are showing a flattening out of \ndemand. We were concerned that the shorter the waiting times became, the greater the \ndemand would be. We are finding that the total waiting lists trends are flattening for \nout-patients and, in fact, they are going down for in-patients. We will be keeping a \nclose eye on that because it has been an important factor in designing the 2009 and \nbeyond project. We also have referral schemes in place to ensure that referrals are \nappropriate and are going to the appropriate place, and they are providing a loop of \ninformation back to organisations and primary care. We are mindful that this could be \na danger, but, so far—and particularly since about March 2003—the trend in out-\npatients has flattened away from the quite steep curve that it was on. \n \n[286] Leighton Andrews: May I ask about the issue raised in paragraph 2.11, about \nthe threat of a pandemic? Is it part of the planning of your 2009 access unit to look at \ncontingencies around this? \n \n[287] Ms Lloyd: Yes, it is indeed. Of course, if there is a pandemic, our first priority \nhas to be to manage those people who are critically ill. We are about to discuss with \nthe general practitioner community what its response would be. We have trends from \nthe Chief Medical Officer’s department on what pandemics might look like, and he is \nmodelling three or four types for us at the moment, so that the deliver-and-support \n 1810/07/2006 \nunit can model the consequences. Of course, we do not know when it will happen, but \nhe is sure that it is going to. I think that a judgment would have to be taken on \nwhether or not we would suspend the target in the advent of a serious pandemic in \nWales. I think that that would have to be a judgment made by the Government, but we \nwould have to deal with that, first and foremost.  \n \n[288] Leighton Andrews: Would that judgment have to be made at a UK level at \nthe same time? \n \n[289] Ms Lloyd: Yes, I would think so. We might not come to the same decision, \nbut it would have to be at the same time. [Laughter.] \n \n[290] Leighton Andrews: I will not go there. \n \n[291] Christine Gwyther: You touched earlier on the fact that the engagement of \nclinicians is important in driving down waiting times. There is a clear political and \nmoral imperative to drive down waiting times. However, forgive me for being \ncynical, but is it not useful for clinicians who also operate in private practice to have \nwaiting lists that are as long as possible, because then they will pick up more private \nwork? How are you engaging with clinicians in a direct enough manner to help them \nto overcome that real dilemma for them? \n \n[292] Ms Lloyd: We have long been aware of the consequences of long waiting \ntimes on private practice, and I am afraid that that is where I have to leave that one. \nHowever, we do have to engage the clinical community. As you know, we are the \nonly country that is monitoring, in an open way, the consequences of the consultant \ncontract—what the consultants are doing, what is reasonable for them to do, and their \nworkload—and we are building those job plans and their consequences into the \nproject. It is perfectly justifiable for clinicians to undertake as much work as they \nwish for the NHS or the private sector, but we have to ensure that those working with \nthe NHS are being adjudged fairly between the specialties and that we can use their \nskills and talents to effect an improvement in these waiting times. \n \n[293] However short waiting lists are, patients have a choice: they can always go to \nthe private sector or not. We are also working with the private sector in getting a \nbetter handle on what is happening, what it can do for us and how its capacity can \nhelp us to achieve this goal. I do not know whether you want to add anything, John. \n \n[294] Mr Hill-Tout: I think that, in terms of private practice generally in Wales, the \nnumbers are very small. There is not a large amount of private practice in Wales \nanyway, so the extent to which consultants work outside the NHS hospitals—and, of \ncourse, they are entitled to do that—is fairly limited. By engaging with the private \nsector in this short-term period—for example, the second-offer scheme relied quite \nheavily on the private sector to ensure that NHS-funded care could be delivered in \nother settings—that is only a short-term expedient, but the private sector has been \nhelpful in that regard, and I think that it will continue to be. However, measures like \nengaging with clinicians in the management exercise of tackling waiting times and the \npooling of lists—so that if there are three orthopaedic surgeons offering care in a local \nhospital, the referral is always made to the consultant with the lowest list—will mean \nthat we can keep the balance between the patient making the choice and having the \n 1910/07/2006 \nNHS offer available to them, rather than their having to go to the private sector. It has \nalways been there, has it not? It is a dilemma that the NHS has faced since its \ninception. We need to manage that effectively, and I think that we do, on the whole.  \n \n[295] Christine Gwyther: I think that I would prefer it not to be there, personally, \nand that is a dilemma that we should not have to be facing. What is the ultimate \nsanction if the management of a trust believes that one of its clinicians is not moving \nthings along as quickly as he or she should be? We are desperate for clinicians. How \noften are sanctions used against clinicians? \n \n[296] Ms Lloyd: Consultants’ contracts have only been in for a very short period of \ntime, and it is only this year that the management members of trusts are obtaining the \ndata on the sort of workload being carried by individual clinicians. They are members \nof trusts’ staff and they have to deal with them as they would any member of their \nstaff. They have to have that dialogue with them. They are supposed to review their \njob plans very regularly, and they must ensure that they are getting a fair deal. It is a \nproblem if that is not the case. In my experience, trying to stop clinicians working too \nhard was my problem. The vast majority give far more than a day’s work, quite \nfrankly. \n \n[297] Janet Davies: At the end of this evidence session, I thank you both, Mrs \nLloyd and Mr Hill-Tout, for your very helpful answers. You will receive a draft \ntranscript before it is published.  \n \n \n 20Annex B\n \n \n \nKathryn Jenkins  \nClerk to the Audit Committee \nNational Assembly for Wales \nCardiff Bay \nCardiff \nCF99 1NA \n \n \n \n \n \nFURTHER INFORMATION RESULTING FROM ASSEMBLY AUDIT \nCOMMITTEE EVIDENCE SESSION, 6 July 2006 - “NHS Waiting Times – \nfollow up paper” \n \n \nFurther to the Committee’s session on 6 July 2006, I undertook to write to you \nwith further information on the rise in the proportion of patients waiting over \nsix months per thousand population for inpatient or daycase treatment within \nthe Swansea LHB area. \n \nThe issue had arisen because the figures for the Swansea community \nappeared to be inconsistent when compared to the position in the rest of \nWales.   \n \nThe chart in question, chart 4 on page 8 of the report is based on LHB \npopulations and relates to the number of Swansea LHB residents waiting over \nsix months at the end of March 2005 and March 2006. \n \nDuring this period, the Welsh Assembly Government target of having no one \nwaiting over 12 months for inpatient or daycase treatment was achieved for \nSwansea LHB residents. \n \nDuring the period March 2005 – March 2006, the total number of patients from \nSwansea LHB on a waiting list increased from 4,434 to 5,804, a rise of 31%.  \nDuring the same period, the proportion waiting over six months increased \nfrom 21% in March 2005 to 26% in March 2006.  Since the end of March \n2006, the total numbers waiting has increased slightly to 5,891, whilst the \nproportion waiting over six months has increased to 29%. \n \n \nTable1 below show the number of patients waiting over six months in the top \nsix specialities from the end of March 2005 to the end of March 2006.  As can \nbe seen, there has been a rise in the numbers waiting over six months in most \nof the main specialities.  \n \nTable 1: Top 6 Speciality split for Swansea LHB residents  \n% change \n Mar 05 Jun 05 Sept 05 Dec 05 Mar 06 Mar 05 -\nMar 06 \nT&O 331 355455509637 +92 \nGen Surgery 226 111 103 206 275 +22 \nGynaecology 172 158 136 158 249 +45 \nENT 46 462945165 +259 \nPlastic Surgery 36 42 79 67 59 +64 \nUrology 67 46404465 -3 \nOther 46 46566178 +70 \nTotal 924 8048981,0901,528 +65 \n \n \nAs these patients are from Swansea LHB, the majority of them will be waiting \nat Swansea NHS Trust, though a proportion of them will be waiting at other \ntrusts within Wales, including Cardiff & Vale.  The information below will be \nbased on those waiting at Swansea NHS Trust. \n \nDuring 2005/06 Swansea NHS Trust was used as the pilot for a Delivery and \nSupport Unit intervention and their waiting times management systems were \nscrutinised in great detail.  In particular, a big emphasis was placed on the \nPrimary Targeted List (PTL) process.  This is the process by which we ensure \nthat routine patients are treated as far as possible in date order of going on \nthe list.  The net effect is that the longest waiting patients are treated first, but \nthis will result in the number of shorter wait routine patients increasing. \n \nPlans are in place within Swansea NHS Trust to maintain the current 12-\nmonth target and to reduce down to a maximum of eight months by 31 March \n2007. \n \nWith reference to the comparative position between Swansea and the rest of \nWales, it is difficult to be certain as to why this differential has emerged.  \nHowever, it is probable that due to the reduction in the outpatient waiting list \nfrom 18 months down to 12 months, a significant proportion of these patients \nwill have converted to the inpatient/daycase list with an urgent priority, i.e. to \nbe seen in less than three months.  To enable these patients to be seen, \nwhilst still maintaining the 12 month inpatient/daycase target, the list has \nincreased under the target area in the six to twelve month band. \n \nI am copying this letter to the Auditor General for Wales and the Assembly \nCompliance Office. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Hill-Tout \nJoint Director, Directorate of Performance and Operations \n",

But we would like there to be a lot more detail about what this will mean in practice.\n\n\"Research shows that poverty can have a huge effect on your ability to parent well and protect your children from disadvantage. Low paid jobs do not lift parents out of poverty – particularly when only one parent works, as the recent IPPR research showed.\n\n\"It is important that if parents go back to work they are well-trained, paid well and they have good quality child care. This, as the conservative party now recognises is not just vital in the early years, but also when children are in secondary school.\"\n\n \n\nNotes for editors\n\n \n\n \n\n1)The conservative party's new Work for Welfare policy green papers says that they want to ensure lone parents are encouraged to return to work but not forced into a position where they have to work hours that are completely incompatible with good parenting. It also recommends that all parents with children under the age of 18 the right to seek flexible working from their employers, and that their childcare strategy will also address the challenges faced by parents of school aged children.\n\n2) The Family and Parenting Institute is the UK's leading centre of expertise in families and parenting.

The Cheshire Waste Partnership is currently consulting\nlocal people about the need to generate energy from waste. At a\nmeeting of the Borough Councils Board on Thursday (30th September),\nCouncillors will be looking at how the impact of the facilities\nneeded to produce energy from waste can be minimized by making\nincreased household waste recycling as easy as possible for\neveryone. \n\n \n\nOne of the ideas is to introduce an additional wheelie bin at\nthose properties where there is enough space. This extra bin would\nbe for the collection of dry recyclable materials such as\ncardboard, cans, plastic bottles and possibly textiles. This would\nreduce the contents of the grey bins to such an extent that they\nwould only need emptying on alternate weeks - an approach which has\nsuccessfully been introduced in many places both in this country\nand abroad. \n\n \n\nThe new arrangements, which could be introduced later next\nyear, would go a long way in helping increase the amount of\nmaterial capable of being recycled and would help meet Government\ntargets. \n\nSaid the Councils Recycling Manager Paul Ramsdale:  \"The\nmixed dry recyclable materials in the new bin would need sorting\nbefore we could sell them to various reprocessing contractors. To\nachieve this, we are suggesting that a Materials Recycling Facility\nbe developed within the existing Borough Council depot in Pyms\nLane.\" \n\n \n\nDavid Marren, Executive Director for Direct Services\nsaid:  \"We are keen to help householders increase their\nrecycling efforts as safely and economically as possible. We are\ndoing everything we can to recycle and compost as much as possible\nto reduce the impact of any measures to tackle current waste\ndisposal problems, such as Energy from Waste and\nland-filling.\" \n\n \n\nENDS \n\n\n\nCouncil\nContact:               \nPaul Ramsdale Recycling Manager \n\nTelephone:                        \n01270 537840 \n\n \n\n \n\nCouncil Press Contact:       Ian\nRichardson - Press Officer \n\nTelephone:                        \n01270 537565 \n\n\nEmail:                               news.views@crewe-nantwich.gov.uk \n\n \n\n154 2004 \n\n27th September 2004 \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMain Sections\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvice and Emergencies |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBusiness |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCommunity and Life Events |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEducation and Health |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJobs and Careers |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLeisure and Tourism |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNews and Views |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlanning and Environment |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYour Council |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA-Z of Services |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t | Links\n | Help\n | Feedback\n | FAQ\n | Disclaimer\n | Copyright\n | Privacy Statement\n | \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCrewe and Nantwich Borough Council, Municipal Buildings, Earle Street, Crewe, Cheshire, CW1 2BJ.

Check out\n  Thruxton, for example where you can drive anything from Karts to 4x4s, supercars\n  and racing cars.\n\nGive someone you care about a memorable birthday, valentines or Christmas\n  treat with a driving\n  experience voucher.

But knowledge of the scale and distribution of compliance costs is needed for accurate cost-benefit analyses of changes to the structure of benefits/tax credits. \n\n\tÂ \tRelated subject areas\n Tax and benefit system\nPeople working on the project\n Fran Bennett\n Mike Brewer\n Jonathan Shaw\nÂ \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ \n\t\t\t\tÂ \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tDisclaimer Â· Copyright Â· Accessibility Â· Email webmaster Â· \n\nLast updated 09-04-08\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tÂ \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n",

          "BrBriefing note: Draft Marine Bill  \n \nBr \nImplications for Fisheries and \n \n \nConservation in Thames region\n \n7th May 2008\n \n \nThe Draft Marine Bill \n \n1.0 Why we need a Marine Bill \n1.1 On the UK mainland, we have some of the world’s best environmental \nlegislation for both protecting species and habitats and guiding planning. However, \nin the marine environment there is no strategic planning system, and the species \nand habitats legislation is not as good as the system we have for land, for example \nthere is no marine equivalent of declaring Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) to \nprotect the most valuable sites. Legislation for inshore fisheries management is \noutdated and does not provide managers with the tools they need to support a \nsustainable fishing industry. The system for applying for licenses and permits has \nbeen criticised as confusing for the developer, being excessively bureaucratic and \ncostly. There are also many organisations working in the marine environment, \nmanaging different activities. This has been criticised as being overcomplicated and \nconfusing. \n2.0 What is it going to cover \n2.1 To achieve better and more sustainable marine management, the Bill is looking \ninto five key areas, called work streams.  \n• Marine planning \n• Marine licensing \n• Marine nature conservation \n• Modernising marine Fisheries \n• Marine management organisation \nAs well as these five work streams the Bill is also looking at coastal access and \nmigratory and freshwater fisheries legislation as well. \n \n3.0 Current consultation and specific objectives \n \n3.1 The draft Marine Bill was published by Defra for a third round of consultation \nrd th\nlasting 12 weeks from 3 April 2008, ending on the 26 June. The Bill is high level \nenabling legislation. Defra aims to introduce the Bill to Parliament in the autumn, \nwith a view to Royal Assent being granted in spring 2009. This will depend on the \navailability of Parliamentary time.  It aims to address the following work areas: \n \n• Establishment of a new Marine Management Organisation (MMO) to deliver new \nmarine functions created by the Bill. \n• Introduction of a new strategic marine planning system; \n• Streamlined marine licensing; \n• Halt the decline of marine biodiversity across the European Union by 2010. • Establish and maintain a network of nationally and internationally important \nprotected sites, broadly equivalent to Habitats Directive and SSSIs sites on land. \nThese will be called Marine Conservation Zones, with the first tranche by 2010.  \n• Implement an ecosystem approach to management. \n• Improved inshore fisheries management, including Sea Fisheries Committee \nreform; \n• Some new migratory and freshwater fisheries legislation \n• Enforcement \n• Administrative Penalties \n• Clauses on coastal access.  \n \n4.0 Where it will apply \n \nThe draft Bill applies across the UK as far as possible, in line with the devolution \nsettlement. The UK Government will legislate for England, for some offshore \nactivities and for certain functions within the territorial waters of Scotland, Wales \nand Northern Ireland. Where changes are being made, or new powers are being \ncreated in England, similar changes or powers will also be made for Wales. Where \nresponsibilities are devolved, Welsh Ministers will decide how these changes will be \napplied. Scotland plans to take forward its own Marine Bill and create a Scottish \nMMO. A Marine Policy Statement (MPS) is being created for the whole UK, \nalthough Scotland is not participating in this. \n \nImplications for Thames region \n \n5.0 Inshore Fisheries \n \n5.1 The Bill makes provision for Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) \nto be created and sets out the maximum extent of IFCA jurisdiction. IFCAs will be \nformed from existing Sea Fisheries Committees (SFC), however this will dissolve \nany Environment Agency Sea Fish Committee responsibility currently held in areas \nsuch as the Thames estuary. We are engaged with the Kent and Essex SFC on this \nissue as part of our ongoing consultations.  \n \n5.2 Our national view is to establish practical boundaries on a case by case basis in \nestuaries, based upon the upstream limit of commercial fishing interest, with us \nmanaging all fisheries interests upstream of this boundary and migratory fisheries \ninterest below. \n \n5.3 Extended powers will given to IFCAs.  A new Kent and Essex IFCA will be \nrequired to manage wider fisheries interests in the lower tideway and outer Thames \nestuary for conservation as well as commercial exploitation.  To help make this \nhappen IFCAs will be given more powers to raise additional funds through existing \nprecepts with local authorities associated with IFCA boundaries. \n  \n5. 4 With respect to this, we would like the IFCAs to have a duty to exercise their \nfunctions to be compliant with Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. \nDefra do not want to cite WFD specifically otherwise they say they would have to list \nHabitats Directive and others. This will mean a clearer sharing of responsibility for maintaining good ecological status is coastal waters and delivering improvements \nwhere needed.  \n \n5.5 We would also like IFCAs to have a duty to consider sustainable development, \nand when fisheries regulations are made for inshore waters, we want to ensure a \ntwo-way approval of measures (as currently provided in the Salmon Act 1986) not \nsimply consultation between us and the IFCAs.  \n \n6.0 Migratory and Freshwater Fisheries  \n \n6.1 We welcome the proposals to modernise certain aspects of the current \nmigratory and freshwater fisheries legislation within the Marine Bill. In particular, we \nsupport extending our powers and duties to include additional migratory species \n(lamprey and smelt initially); better manage fishing effort for eel and other species; \nto make emergency byelaws in response to unforeseeable pressures; and to reform \nthe regulation of live fish movements. This will apply to waters in England and \nWales.  \n \nByelaw making powers \n \n6.2 The Marine Bill proposes to modernise various aspects of our byelaw making \npowers. It also proposes to streamline the process to achieve this. To implement a \nnew byelaw it can currently take around 12 to 18 months from conception to \nimplementation, to include consultation, advertising and working with objections. \nThis is not adequate when responding to emergency situations. Although any new \nnational byelaw will provide a consistent framework across the country, exception \nclauses where appropriate will allow for local variations.  There are issues of \ndrafting relating to the workability and enforceability of measures that we will \ncontinue to discuss with Defra. \n \nManaging eel populations \n \n6.3 The Marine Bill proposes to extend net limitation order (NLO) powers to cover \nall net fisheries for species under our jurisdiction, most importantly those for eel, \nwhich are declared to be outside safe biological limits. We will also get the power to \nmake an eel net fishing close season.  A draft Thames Eel Management Plan \n(EMP) is currently in preparation for public consultation later this year. Clearly some \nof the actions will be dependent on the Draft Marine Bill gaining Royal descent from \nspring 2009. We aim to begin to implement the new EMP during 2009.  \n \nClose Seasons for recreational fishing \n \n6.4 We will have the power to set close season entirely by national byelaw, rather \nthan being subject to statutory minimum periods. In the case of the coarse fish close \nseason, this is three months, unless it is dispensed with. This provides greater \nflexibility to meet future circumstances, especially the uncertainty of climate change.  \nWe will gain powers to make emergency interim byelaws to prevent damage to fish \nstocks and fisheries from unforeseen circumstances, such as drought or fish \ndisease.  \n Coarse fish removal \n \n6.5 The Marine Bill should clarify our byelaw making powers in respect of coarse \nfish removal. This will allow us to proceed with considering new national byelaws to \naddress this issue.  \n \n6.6 Many anglers are concerned about what seems to be over-complicated and \ninconsistent byelaws between regions regarding the taking of fish.  A recent national \nworkshop held in London to help tackle illegal fishing highlighted the need for new \nconsistent national byelaws to help clarify what anglers are legally entitled to take or \notherwise.  There was considerable debate for and against allowing the taking of \nany coarse fish.  This will become a matter for public consultation in the making of \nany new byelaw  which would most likely be introduced in 2010.     \n \nLive fish movements regulation \n \n6.7 Current powers to prevent inappropriate fish movements (to prevent the spread \nof fish disease and non-native fish) are limited. They are difficult to enforce and \nexpensive/bureaucratic to administer. The Marine Bill will provide the powers to \nintroduce a new scheme to manage live fish movements. This will rely on and \ncomplement forthcoming EU legislation (see Fish Health Directive below). Together, \nthese regulations will place greater emphasis on regulating the fish supply industry, \nrelying on a more risk-based approach to regulating individual fish movements.  \n \n7.0 Nature Conservation \n \n7.1 The issues surrounding the Bill’s impact on nature conservation in Thames \nRegion are still surrounded by some uncertainty due to a lack of detail within the \nBill. The main concerns are centred on the marine planning and licensing issues. \n \n7.2 When licensing activities the Agency brings to bear various pieces of \nconservation legislation due to its nature conservation and sustainability duties. We \nhave a concern that as the Bill stands our present licensing systems and those of \nthe new MMO may have different environmental standards e.g. marine \ndevelopments which come above mean low water on the tideway may require \nAgency and MMO licensing with different environmental and sustainability \nstandards being applied. We are also concerned about the perceived lack of \necological expertise within the MMO.  These are national issues which are still to be \nresolved but could affect Thames Region. \n \n7.2 At present the draft Bill does not bestow equivalent environmental \nresponsibilities on the MMO as those of the Agency when dealing with strategic \nplanning. As we are likely to be a statutory consultee to the new marine planning \nsystem both at a strategic and site level, this has the potential to lead to conflict. We \nare also uncertain how marine planning and licensing will  must include measures \nfor protecting or ensuring ‘good status’ so that the aims and objectives of  our River \nBasin Plan under WFD are met. \n \n7.3 We support the introduction of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZ). We want to \nbe able to nominate important areas of the marine environment as MCZs. If MCZs are nominated within our estuary we may have a need to screen our consents and \npermits to ensure they are not impacted. This should not be a significant issue with \nour current staffing levels. \n \n7.4 The actual impact on our ability to manage and improve the marine environment \nwill not be fully understood until the conservation duties of the MMO are set and our \nrelationship with the MMO’s regulatory and planning sections are given detailed \nconsideration by Defra. \n \n8.0 Coastal access \n \n8.1 The draft Bill builds on existing legislation to create an access route for the \npublic around the coast of England. \n \n8.2 We support new access where it does not have adverse impacts. We are \nparticularly concerned to ensure that increased access to the coast must not affect \nthe management of coastal flood risk and erosion and impact on important \nconservation sites. \n \n8.3 We are pleased that coastal access clauses now include us as a statutory \nconsultee on the access route and take account of coastal flood risk and erosion \nmanagement (these were previously our two key areas of concern). In particular, \nany consideration of flood risk by NE or its agents, must be advised on by the \nAgency. \n \n \nMATT CARTER \nSTRATEGIC SPECIALIST (FISHERIES) \n \nCHRIS CATLING  \nPRINCIPLE OFFICER (CONSERVATION) \n \n",

Police officers attacked protesters at Heathrow airport as they struggled to halt the forced deportation of Iraqi Kurdish asylum seeker Amanj Gafor.  Immigration officers, desperate to avoid protests, tried to deport Amanj from Gatwick airport instead. \nIt was the second time Amanj's supporters had travelled to Heathrow to save him from deportation. This time the authorities were intent on crushing any resistance.  \"The police were very heavy,\" said protest organiser Mike Taylor from Bristol, who was arrested at Heathrow. A photographer was also arrested and a BBC camera crew blocked from filming what was going on.\" \nMike and the other protesters had assumed that Amanj had been put on the Gatwick plane, and that was the last they would ever see of him.  But on Monday refugee groups discovered that he was in fact caged in Gatwick's refugee detention centre. He had put up such a fight that he could not be forced onto the plane. \nOne of his friends says, \"Amanj sounds very desperate over the phone. He is 34 years old. He has no hope. He thinks his life is over. He can't take being locked up any more.\" \nAmanj has been refused asylum even though his father was executed by the Iraqi regime.  The terrible lengths that people will go to to escape oppression was shown at the weekend when a man was found hidden in the wheel arch of a Boeing 747 at Los Angeles airport in the US. \nHe had survived for eight hours, stowed away on a flight from Tahiti. He was moaning, and suffering from hypothermia and dehydration, after being exposed to temperatures of 50 degrees below zero. \n\"His clothes were shredded from the wind and he was covered with grease,\" said a medical spokesperson.  Yet New Labour is now deporting 100 such desperate people every day-a 28 percent increase from this time last year. \nUnder the immediate threat of deportation are the Afghanis who arrived at Stansted airport in February as passengers on a hijacked plane.  All except one have now had their claims for asylum refused.  Those turned down include a 41 year old father of seven who was tortured by the Taliban regime and held in a basement for 20 days. \nBut resistance to New Labour's scapegoating is growing.  There have been successful protests outside supermarkets calling for the scrapping of the government's voucher scheme.  Asylum seekers are given vouchers for food and \"essential goods\", which add up to just 70 percent of Income Support. \nIn Scotland this weekend supporters of the Committee to Defend Asylum Seekers were to be out campaigning.  More days of action against the voucher scheme are planned on Friday 18 and Saturday 19 August, and Friday 8 and Saturday 9 September.\n\tFax emergency protests demanding the release of Amanj Gafor (case number 81035529) to Home Office minister Barbara Roche on 020 7273 2043.\n\n\nTGWU to slam vouchers at TUC\nTHE GROWING mood in support of asylum seekers could be boosted by the call from the giant TGWU manual workers' union for the immediate abolition of the government's voucher scheme.\nTGWU leader Bill Morris condemned the government's capitulation to the Tories and the right wing press over refugees earlier this year.  Now the TGWU has submitted a motion to this September's Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Glasgow. \nThe motion condemns \"the recent distasteful spectacle of refugees and asylum seekers being used as a political football\".  It \"pledges its support and solidarity to all refugees arriving in Britain\".  And it calls for the TUC to campaign for the abolition of the voucher scheme, which can \"only serve to further alienate, stigmatise and segregate refugees, which in turn leads to an even more negative reaction from the local communities into which they are integrated\". \nA TGWU spokesperson told\n Socialist Worker, \"Trade unions are not an island. We have a responsibility to society. We are for the immediate abolition of the voucher system and we are looking for a unanimous vote from the TUC conference floor.\" \n\nPROTEST\nScotland protests against the voucher scheme, Saturday 12 August: \n GLASGOW\n 2pm, Sainsbury's, outside Buchanan Galleries, Buchanan Street.   EDINBURGH 12 noon, Sainsbury's, St Andrew's Square.\n\tContact the Committee to Defend Asylum Seekers on 0958 478 628.\n\n\nA DEMONSTRATION was set to take place in Hull on Saturday in protest at a savage attack on an asylum seeker.  The asylum seeker, believed to be Kurdish, was beaten by a gang in a park and had to be hospitalised. \nHull's asylum seekers' support group has called the march in response, and the Labour group which controls Hull City Council has backed it with a £500 donation.  The protest also has the backing of the Hull council workers' UNISON union and a local NATFHE lecturers' union branch.\n\tAssemble Saturday 12 August, 1pm, Victoria Square, Hull.\n\n\n\t\n\n        Return\n        to index \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n",

In May 2002 Mr Raymond McCord Senior made a complaint to the \nPolice Ombudsman for Northern Ireland about police conduct in \nrelation to the murder of his son, Mr Raymond McCord Junior. His \ncomplaint alleged that police over a number of years, acted in such a \nway as to protect informants from being fully accountable to the law.  \n \n2. Preliminary enquiries following receipt of Mr McCord’s complaint \nshowed that there were sufficient issues of concern to warrant a wide-\nranging investigation not only into matters relating to the investigation \nof Mr McCord’s son’s murder, but also into the police handling and \nmanagement of identified informants from the early 1990s onwards.  \n \n3. In the course of the investigation the Police Ombudsman sought the \ncooperation of a number of retired RUC/PSNI senior officers. Officers \nwho were being treated as witnesses were asked to provide an \nexplanation of Special Branch and CID internal practices during this \nperiod.  Investigators offered to meet retired officers at venues with \nwhich they would be comfortable and at times which would suit them.   \nThey were advised of the areas of questioning and provided with \nsignificant disclosure of information, at their request.  The majority of \nthem failed even to reply.  This was despite the fact that witness details \nwould be anonomised in any public statement. Amongst those who \nrefused were two retired Assistant Chief Constable’s, seven Detective \nChief Superintendent’s and two Detective Superintendent’s.   \n \n4. Some retired officers did assist the investigation, and were helpful. \nOfficers varied a great deal in the manner in which they responded to \nquestions. Some, including some retired officers dealt with challenging \nquestions in a professional manner.  \n \n \n5 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n5. Others, including some serving officers, gave evasive, contradictory, \nand on occasion farcical answers to questions. On occasion those \nanswers indicated either a significant failure to understand the law, or \ncontempt for the law. On other occasions the investigation \ndemonstrated conclusively that what an officer had told the Police \nOmbudsman’s investigators was completely untrue. \n \n6. The Police Ombudsman’s initial concerns about PSNI informant \nmanagement processes caused her to alert the Chief Constable to \nthose concerns in March 2003. She subsequently made him aware on \n8 September 2003 of her very detailed concerns about these matters. \nShe also alerted the Surveillance Commissioner on 15 September \n2003. He carried out an inspection of the Special Branch handling of \nInformant 1. That inspection found serious failings by Special Branch to \ncomply with the requirements of the law in relation to the handling of \ninformants.   \n \n7. The wider investigation was focused on seven main lines of enquiry, \nwhich had emerged during preliminary enquiries and in respect of \nwhich serious concerns had arisen.  They were, in chronological order \nof event: \n \n• two attempted murders in 1991.  \n• the murder of Sharon McKenna on 17 January 1993.  \n• the attempted bombing of the Sinn Fein office in \nMonaghan on 3 March 1997.  \n• the blocking by Special Branch of searches during a pre-\nplanned CID operation intended to disrupt the activities of \nthe UVF.  \n• the murder of John Harbinson on 18 May 1997.  \n• the murder of Raymond McCord Junior on 9 November \n1997.  \n \n6 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Informant 1’s alleged involvement in drug-dealing between \n1994 and 2003.  \n \n8. Other issues emerged during the course of the investigation and were \nconsidered as part of the investigation. \n \n9. Intelligence reports and other documents within the RUC and the PSNI, \nmost of which were rated as ‘reliable and probably true’, linked \ninformants, and in particular one man who was a police informant \n(referred to in this report as Informant 1)  to the following  ten  murders: \n \n• Mr Peter McTasney who died on 24 February 1991; \n• Ms Sharon McKenna who died on 17 January 1993; \n• Mr Sean McParland who was attacked on 17 February 1994, \nand died on 25 February 1994; \n• Mr Gary Convie who died on 17 May 1994; \n• Mr Eamon Fox who died on 17 May 1994, in the same attack \nas Mr Gary Convie; \n• Mr Gerald Brady who died on 17 June 1994; \n• Mr Thomas Sheppard who died on 21 March 1996;  \n• Mr John Harbinson who died on 18 May 1997; \n• Mr Raymond McCord Junior who died on 09 November 1997 \n• Mr Thomas English who died on 31 October 2000. \n \nThe Police Ombudsman’s investigators also identified less significant \npolice intelligence implicating Informant 1 in 5 other murders. For some \nof these murders, there is generally only one piece of intelligence, \nwhich police have not rated as reliable.  \n \nIntelligence was also found linking police informants, and in particular \nInformant 1, to ten attempted murders between 1989 and 2002.   \n \n7 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nIntelligence was also found which implicated police informants, and in \nparticular, Informant 1, in a significant number of crimes in respect of \nwhich no action or insufficient action was taken: \n \n• Armed robbery; \n• Assault and Grievous Bodily Harm; \n• Punishment shootings and attacks; \n• Possession of munitions; \n• Criminal Damage; \n• Drug dealing; \n• Extortion; \n• Hijacking; \n• Intimidation; \n• Conspiracy to murder; \n• Threats to kill. \n \n8 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n10. Conclusions of the Police Ombudsman about the allegations \nmade by Mr Raymond McCord about the death of his son \n \nAllegation 1: that a senior UVF figure had ordered the murder of his \nson, and that this individual was a police informant.   \nFinding: The Police Ombudsman can confirm that a police \ninformant is a suspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son. She \ncannot confirm or deny who that individual is.  \n \nAllegation 2: that police had failed to carry out a thorough \ninvestigation of his son’s murder, and had failed to keep him updated \nabout their investigation. \n \nFindings: The Police Ombudsman has identified failures in the \ninvestigation of Mr McCord’s son’s murder. These failures may \nhave significantly reduced the possibility of anyone being \nprosecuted for the murder.  \n \nThere is some material which indicates some contact between \nspecific police officers and Mr McCord, particularly during the \ndays immediately following the murder. There has been a failure \nby those supervising the conduct of the police investigation to \nconsider the benefit of identifying at the very least a single point \nof contact for Mr McCord. Such provision may have allowed the \ninvestigation to progress more effectively. \n \nThis allegation is therefore substantiated.  \n \n9 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nAllegation 3: that no-one had been arrested or charged with the \nmurder of his son. Mr McCord alleged that this was because the man \nwho ordered the murder was a police informant, and that this \nindividual, and those working for him, had been protected from arrest \nand prosecution for a number of years. \n \nFindings: A number of people were arrested for Raymond \nMcCord Junior’s murder.  No one has been charged with the \nmurder. There is no evidence that anyone has been protected \nfrom arrest for the murder of Raymond McCord Junior. \n \nWith reference to Mr McCord’s allegation that a police informant \nhad ordered his son’s murder, and that this individual and those \nworking for him had been protected from arrest and prosecution \nfor years the Police Ombudsman conducted an extensive \ninvestigation which is detailed in this Report. It is clear that \nmuch intelligence was disregarded by police and that they \ncontinued to use Informant 1 despite his criminal record and the \nextensive intelligence they held in respect of alleged serious \ncriminality, because he had value to them as an informant.  This \nwas wrong. \n \nThis allegation is therefore substantiated with the exception, \nfirstly, of that part of it which refers to police failure to arrest \nanyone for Raymond McCord Junior’s murder, and secondly, of \nthe fact that, whilst the Police Ombudsman can confirm that an \ninformer is a suspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son, she \ncannot confirm or deny who that individual is.   \n \n10 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nAllegation 4: that unidentified police knew something was going to \nhappen to Raymond McCord Junior, but that they did not warn him or \nhis family about this danger to protect the police informant who was \nresponsible for the murder. \n \nFinding: The Police Ombudsman has found no evidence or \nintelligence to support this allegation. It is not substantiated. \n \n11. There are grave concerns about the practices of some police officers. \nThe activities which were identified included:  \n \n• Failure to arrest informants for crimes to which those informants \nhad allegedly confessed, or to treat such persons as suspects for \ncrime; \n \n• The concealment of intelligence indicating that on a number of \noccasions up to three informants had been involved in a murder \nand other serious crime;  \n \n• Arresting informants suspected of murder, then subjecting them to \nlengthy sham interviews at which they were not challenged about \ntheir alleged crime, and releasing them without charge; \n \n• Creating interview notes which were deliberately misleading; \nfailing to record and maintain original interview notes and failing to \nrecord notes of meetings with informants; \n \n• Not recording in any investigation papers the fact that an \ninformant was suspected of a crime despite the fact that he had \nbeen arrested and interviewed for that crime; \n \n11 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Not informing the Director of Public Prosecutions that an \ninformant was a suspect in a crime in respect of which an \ninvestigation file was submitted to the Director; \n \n• Withholding from police colleagues intelligence, including the \nnames of alleged suspects, which could have been used to \nprevent or detect  crime; \n \n• An instance of blocking searches of a police informant’s home \nand of other locations including an alleged UVF arms dump;  \n \n• Providing at least four misleading and inaccurate documents for \npossible consideration by the Court in relation to four separate \nincidents and the cases resulting from them, where those \ndocuments had the effect of protecting an informant; \n  \n• Finding munitions at an informant’s home and doing nothing \nabout that matter; \n \n• Withholding information about the location to which a group of \nmurder suspects had allegedly fled after a murder; \n \n• Giving instructions to junior officers that records should not be \ncompleted, and that there should be no record of the incident \nconcerned; \n \n• Ensuring the absence of any official record linking a UVF \ninformant to possession of explosives which may, and were \nthought according to a Special Branch officer’s private records, to \nhave been used in a  particular crime; \n \n \n12 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Cancelling the “wanted” status of murder suspects “because of \nlack of resources” and doing nothing further about those \nsuspects;  \n \n• Destroying or losing forensic exhibits such as metal bars; \n \n• Continuing to employ as informants people suspected of \ninvolvement in the most serious crime, without assessing the \nattendant risks or their suitability as informants; \n \n• Not adopting or complying with the United Kingdom Home Office \nGuidelines on matters relating to informant handling, and by not \ncomplying with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act when it \ncame into force in 2000. \n \n12. The cumulative effect of these activities, as described by police \nofficers and as demonstrated in documentation recovered, was to \nprotect Informant 1 and other informants from investigation. In the \nabsence of explanation as to why these events occurred, the Police \nOmbudsman has concluded that this was collusion by certain police \nofficers with identified UVF informants. \n \n13. It is accepted by the Police Ombudsman that intelligence, in itself, is \nnot evidence. However it may be possible to derive investigative \nopportunities from intelligence. There were mechanisms which were \nused by other police forces within the United Kingdom to prevent the \nfailings of informant and intelligence handling identified in this Report. \nThose mechanisms should have involved clear and effective policies \nfor informant handling, combined with regular training and effective \nintrusive management. \n \n \n13 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n14. Although such systems were used, to some extent, by RUC CID, they \nwere not used by Special Branch. In 1997 the RUC introduced new \nrules for informant handling and management. A decision was made \nby Chief Officers that those rules should not apply to Special Branch. \nThe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in 2000 imposed statutory \nrules about the review, management, assessment and cancellation of \ninformants. The Surveillance Commissioner found, following the \nreferral of the matter by the Police Ombudsman, that those rules had \nnot been complied with in the case of Informant 1, and that there had \nbeen a failure to meet National Minimum Standards and to take into \naccount intelligence about Informant 1’s own criminal conduct. \n \n15. In the course of the investigation the Police Ombudsman has \nestimated that payments of at least £79,840 were made to Informant \n1.  \n \n16. The Police Ombudsman has made 20 recommendations and the \nPSNI response to these recommendations is included in the Report. \nPSNI have accepted all the recommendations made to them. \n \n17. Prior to 2003 some RUC/PSNI Special Branch officers facilitated the \nsituation in which informants were able to continue to engage in \nparamilitary activity, some of them holding senior positions in the \nUVF, despite the availability of extensive information as to their \nalleged involvement in crime. Those informants must have known that \nthey were not being dealt with for crime. Some RUC/PSNI officers \nwere complicit in the failure to deal appropriately with Informant 1, and \nother informants, both by way of criminal investigation and by ceasing \nto use them as informants. \n \n18. Since 2003 the PSNI has made significant changes and introduced \nnew policies and working practices in relation to its strategic \n \n14 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nmanagement of its new Crime Operations Department, which includes \nIntelligence Branch (formerly Special Branch) under a single Assistant \nChief Constable.  \n \n19. It is hoped that the further necessary changes, consequential upon \nthis Report will combine with the change already made, to ensure that \nnever again, within the PSNI will there be the circumstances which \nprevailed for so long in relation to the informant handling and \nintelligence managements processes which are discussed in this \nReport. \n \nIt is also essential that, in the arrangements for the future strategic \nmanagement of National Security issues in Northern Ireland, there will be \naccountability mechanisms which are effective, and which are capable of \nensuring that what has happened here does not recur.   \n \n15 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION ONE  \nA MAJOR INVESTIGATION \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.1 Mr McCord’s statement of complaint alleged that police over a number of \nyears, acted in such a way as to protect informants from being fully \naccountable to the law. It included the following specific allegations: \n \n• that a senior UVF figure had ordered the murder of his son, and \nthat this individual was a police informer; \n \n• that police had failed to carry out a thorough investigation of his \nson’s murder, and had failed to keep him updated about their \ninvestigation; \n \n• that no-one had been arrested or charged with the murder of his \nson. Mr McCord alleged that this was because the man who \nordered the murder was a police informant, and that this individual, \nand those working for him, had been protected from arrest and \nprosecution for a number of years; \n \n• that unidentified police knew something was going to happen to \nRaymond McCord Junior, but that they did not warn him or his \nfamily about this danger to protect the police informant who was \nresponsible for the murder. \n \n16 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n1.2 Following initial enquiries of the PSNI in relation to Mr McCord’s \nallegations, the Police Ombudsman established that there was \nintelligence strongly indicating the involvement of informants in several \nmurders and serious crimes. Accordingly the terms of reference of the \ninvestigation were widened. \n  \n1.3 This report will provide a summary of the investigation which was given \nthe name Operation Ballast.  From its outset it has been a criminal \nenquiry into the actions of police officers. During Operation Ballast \ninvestigators have examined a number of incidents in relation to Mr. \nMcCord’s wide-ranging allegation that police shielded an informant and \nhis associates in the UVF, from arrest and prosecution over a number of \nyears. This Report relates to the period from 1991 –2003. \n \n1.4 Over the years, different official terms have been used to describe \nindividuals who supply information to the police. At various stages they \nhave been described as informants, sources, agents, and, with the \nintroduction of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, Covert \nHuman Intelligence Sources, or CHIS. For ease of reference, this report \nwill generally refer to such people as “informants”. \n \n1.5 This report is published by the Police Ombudsman as a report under \nSection 62 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, as she considers \nthat it is in the public interest so to do, given the gravity of the allegations \nand of the findings of the investigation. \n \n \n17 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nHUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES \n \n2.1 The Police Ombudsman has a statutory duty to investigate allegations \nof criminality against the police, including allegations such as those \nmade by Mr McCord that the police may have “colluded” with \nparamilitary informants. \n \n2.2 There are significant risks to the lives of people who are publicly \nrevealed to be, or to have been, paramilitary informants. Northern \nIreland has a history of the murder of those who were even suspected \nof being informants. The most recent murder is thought to be that of a \nself-confessed informant, who died in 2005. \n \n2.3 The Police Ombudsman has a duty to act in compliance with Article 2 \nof the European Convention on Human Rights. This article not only \nconfers rights on individuals who may be informants, but also confers \nobligations on investigators in terms of the nature and scope of the \ninvestigation of any matter in which representatives of the State may \nhave colluded with murderers. \n \n2.4 This report will refer to relevant police informants only as informants. \nNo reference will be made to these informants’ real names, their \nrelatives’ names, their police code-names or their police source \nnumbers. \n \n2.5 The Police Ombudsman will neither confirm nor deny whether the \ninformants referred to in this report are the individuals against whom \nMr. McCord has made his allegations. Nor will she confirm or deny \nwhether any individual is, or ever has been, an informant for the police \nor any part of the security forces. \n \n \n18 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n2.6 Over the years, different official terms have been used to describe \nindividuals who supply information to the police. At various stages they \nhave been described as informants, sources, agents, and, with the \nintroduction of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, Covert \nHuman Intelligence Sources, or CHIS. For ease of reference, this \nreport will generally refer to such people as “informants”. They will be \ndescribed as “Informant 1” and other “Informants”. \n \n2.7 There remains a risk to police officers who have been involved in the \nhandling and management of terrorist informants. Many of these \nindividuals have now retired, but some are still serving officers. This \nReport will refer to such officers by their rank in the relevant period and \nby letter, e.g. Detective Constable A, B, C etc. in alphabetical order as \nthey occur in this report. \n \n2.8 There may also be a risk to other people mentioned in this report and \nthey will therefore be described using letters: A, B, C et cetera. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nINITIAL CONCERNS \n \n3.1 Following receipt of Mr McCord’s complaint, preliminary enquiries were \nundertaken by the Police Ombudsman. These uncovered a large \namount of police intelligence, which implicated informants in murder and \nother serious criminal activity. It uncovered anomalies in relation to a \nrange of Special Branch material relating to informants within the UVF. \n \n3.2 Of particular concern were disturbing irregularities in the police \nmanagement of the individual who will henceforth be referred to as \nInformant 1. These irregularities related to the handling, controlling and \nmanagement of Informant 1, about whom there was considerable \nintelligence, indicative of linkage with the most serious crime, in the \nRUC systems. It is accepted by the Police Ombudsman that intelligence, \nin itself, is not evidence. However it may be capable of providing \nevidential opportunities which then require to be explored.  \n \nChart to show the correlation between the quantity and quality of intelligence \nprovided by and about Informant 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n3.3 When an informant is used by police officers, there is an obligation to \nassess the informant continually, and also to assess and process any \ninformation received. On review of the RUC material, it was discovered \nthat there was no record of any individual written assessment of \nInformant 1 between 1991 and 1999, and no written assessment \nbetween 2000 and 2003, which took into account the large amount of \nintelligence implicating him in serious criminal activity, including murder.  \n \n3.4 Preliminary enquiries showed, therefore, that there were sufficient \nissues of concern to warrant a wide-ranging investigation into the police \nhandling and management of identified informants from the early 1990s \nonwards. The investigation focused on seven main lines of enquiry. \n \n3.5 They were as follows: \n \n• attempted murders  on 18 August 1991 and 16 September 1991.  \n• the murder of Sharon McKenna on 17 January 1993.  \n• the attempted bombing of the Sinn Fein office in Monaghan on 3 \nMarch 1997.  \n• the Operation Mechanic Searches.  \n• the murder of John Harbinson on 18 May 1997.  \n• the murder of Raymond McCord Junior on 9 November 1997.  \n• Informant 1’s alleged involvement in drug-dealing between 1994 and \n2003.  \n \nOther issues emerged during the course of the enquiry and are also \nreferred to in this Report. \n \n21 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nMATTERS BROUGHT TO THE \nATTENTION OF THE \nSECRETARY OF STATE AND \nTHE NORTHERN IRELAND \nOFFICE \n \n3.6 The Police Ombudsman was concerned about the implications, for her \nother ongoing investigative work, of conducting the investigation into \nthese matters, because of the anticipated scale of the investigation, and \nits complex subject matter. She knew that it was inevitable that the \nMcCord investigation would impact adversely on her ability to carry out \nher other obligations. Accordingly she explained the seriousness of the \nallegations to the Secretary of State, and requested additional funding \nfrom the Northern Ireland Office for this enquiry and two other very \nserious investigations. That request was made on 22 January 2003. \nThis request for extra funding was not met, although a sum of £250,000 \nwas provided on 27 November 2003 to assist the Police Ombudsman in \nthese enquiries. \n \n3.7 This sum did not meet the anticipated cost of these enquiries.  The \nPolice Ombudsman, however, decided it was still her duty to conduct \nthese investigations, although it was recognised that it would mean \nresources would have to be diverted from other investigations. It also \nmeant that this investigation was slower than would have been the case \nhad additional resources been made available. It was not possible to \nstart the formal stage of the investigation until 2 June 2003 \n \n \n22 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nMATTERS OF CONCERN \nBROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION \nOF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF \nTHE PSNI. \n \n4.1 The Police Ombudsman rapidly became concerned about informant \nhandling processes within the RUC/PSNI, and she decided that it was \nnecessary to alert the Chief Constable to those concerns so that he \ncould take any necessary action to address the emerging problems as \nrapidly as possible. She therefore communicated her concerns about \nproblems relating to informant handling to the Chief Constable in \nmeetings on 25 March 2003 and other occasions. The Police \nOmbudsman’s Executive Director of Investigations then wrote to the \nChief Constable on 8 September 2003, alerting him to serious concerns \nabout the PSNI management of informants, and the potential failures in \npolice practice which had already been identified. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nMATTERS OF CONCERN \nBROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION \nOF THE SURVEILLANCE    \nCOMMISSIONER \n \n5.1 The Surveillance Commissioner is required by the Regulation of \nInvestigatory Powers Act to inspect the level of police compliance with \nthe requirements of the Act. Preliminary enquiries had indicated to the \nPolice Ombudsman that previous inspections by the Surveillance \nCommissioner had not identified significant non-compliance by the \nPolice Service of Northern Ireland. His report of 26 February 2003, \nwhilst identifying some failings stated \n \n“The majority of CHIS are working for Special Branch in the National \nSecurity area and are well handled and controlled.” \n \nHe also concluded, \n \n“Overall there continues to be a high level of compliance with the \nlegislation and codes of practice.” \n \n5.2 Accordingly the Police Ombudsman brought her concerns to the \nattention of the Surveillance Commissioner on 15 September 2003. The \nSurveillance Commissioner conducted a further inspection on 2 and 3 \nOctober 2003 and reported on 4 October 2004. \n \n5.3 On 6 October 2003 the PSNI set up a Covert Human Intelligence \nSource Risk Analysis Group to undertake a full and comprehensive risk \nanalysis of all PSNI informants.  On 23 August 2004 the PSNI wrote to \n \n24 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nthe Police Ombudsman advising her of the progress of the Covert \nHuman Intelligence Source Risk Analysis Group to that date. One of the \noutcomes was that 24% of informants were cancelled. 12% of all \ninformants were cancelled because they no longer provided useful \ninformation and 12% because they were involved in serious crime. \n \n \n25 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE INITIATION AND SCOPE \nOF THE INVESTIGATION.  \n \n6.1 As a consequence of her emerging findings, the Police Ombudsman \ndecided that there should be an extensive investigation into Mr. \nMcCord’s complaint, and the issues arising from it, and that the terms of \nreference of the enquiry should be widened to include: \n \n• the collection and analysis of specific informant files and authorities \nfor the deployment of those informants; \n \n• intelligence in respect of named individuals and incidents; and  \n \n• enquiries into police actions in respect of the investigation of many \nidentified murders and other serious crimes. \n \n6.2 The Police Ombudsman has examined police processes for the handling \nand management of informants, and intelligence from, and about, \ninformants from within a UVF unit in North Belfast and Newtownabbey, \nprimarily from 1991-2003, although reference is made to matters \noccurring from 1989.  Intelligence indicates that members of this unit \nwere responsible for the murder of Raymond McCord Junior.  The Police \nOmbudsman has also examined whether the actions of police officers \nmay have prevented these people from being held accountable for any \ncrimes, including the murders of Raymond McCord Junior and other \nindividuals. \n \n6.3 Analysis of information about the informants whose alleged activities \nemerged during the course of this Report, which focused on the activities \nof Informant 1, indicated a high level of alleged criminality.  \n \n26 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n  \nInformant 1 \n \n6.4 The investigation has established that Informant 1: \n \n• was a member of the UVF in North Belfast; \n \n• progressed through the ranks of the UVF; \n• was never a registered CID informant; \n \n• was recruited through his ‘long-standing friendship’ with  a police \nofficer \n \n• provided intelligence to DC A and DS M prior to his formal \nregistration as an informant; \n \n• became a Special Branch informant in 1991; \n \n• continued to be jointly handled by CID officers and Special Branch \nofficers from May 1991 until February 1995 and by Special Branch \nalone from 1995 – 2003; \n \n• Provided in excess of 400 pieces of intelligence over twelve years; \n \n• Was the subject of in excess of 500 pieces of intelligence, provided \nby others over twelve years;  \n \n• was allegedly involved in the murder of ten individuals;  \n \n• was allegedly involved in the attempted murder of ten individuals; \n \n• was allegedly involved in other serious crime including targeting an \nindividual for a murder in 1994, a bomb attack in Monaghan in \n1997, “punishment” attacks, drug dealing and attempting to pervert \nthe course of justice; \n \n• was never given participating “informant status” by the RUC/PSNI; \n \n• was never fully investigated for the majority of these crimes ; \n \n• has an extensive criminal record including convictions for serious \ncrime; \n \n \n27 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• was considered in the course of a report on joint informant handling \nby Special Branch and CID in March 1995 when he was described \nby Detective Inspector F of Special Branch as; \n“A particularly difficult source to handle who tells only a fraction of \nwhat he knows and for this reason would require strong, careful and \nfully controlled and co-ordinate handling” \n \n• has been described by some of the uniformed and CID officers who \nworked in the North Belfast area between the early 1990s and \n2003 as “a well-known terrorist and criminal”, who was involved in \nracketeering, drug dealing, feuding with UDA and other general \ncrime. Some of the officers state that there were rumours Informant \n1 was an informant and that Informant 1 appeared to be a \n“protected species”, as he was heavily involved in crime and was \nrarely held to account; \n \n• has been paid in excess of £79,000 during a twelve year period \nfrom 1991 - 2003; \n \n \nOther Informants \n \n6.5 The investigation has further established that other informants: \n \n• were members of the UVF; \n \n• received financial payments from the police; \n \n• provided intelligence about crime that was not forwarded to CID \ninvestigators; \n \n• were associated with informant 1; \n \n• were mostly handled by the same informant handlers as informant \n1; \n \n• provided intelligence on the criminal activities of Informant 1 and \neach other; \n \n• had UVF roles including responsibility for ‘punishment’ shootings; \n \n• were allegedly involved in murders; \n \n \n28 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• were allegedly involved in the planning of murders; \n \n• were allegedly involved in attempted murders; \n \n• were allegedly involved in serious criminality, including drug \ndealing and kidnap; \n \n• were not given “participating informant” status by the police;  \n \n• were never fully investigated for the majority of these crimes; \n \n \nChart to show the percentage of gradings of all intelligence held in relation to \n \nInformant 1 between 1991 and 2003. \nE\nUngraded\nX\n2%\nA1\n3%\nF\n3%\n7%\nD\n1%\nC\n0%\n7%\nA1\nB2\nC\nD\nE\nF\nX\nUngraded\nB2\n 77%\n \n6.6 Amongst that intelligence was information implicating Informant 1 in the \nfollowing murders: \n \n• Mr Peter McTasney, who died on 24 February 1991; \n \n• Ms Sharon McKenna, who died on 17 January 1993; \n \n• Mr Sean McParland, who was attacked on 17 February \n1994, and died on 25 February 1994; \n \n \n29 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Mr Gary Convie, who  died on 17 May 1994; \n \n• Mr Eamon Fox, who died on 17 May 1994, in the same \nattack as Mr Gary Convie; \n \n• Mr Gerald Brady, who died on 17 June 1994; \n \n• Mr Thomas Sheppard, who died on 21 March 1996; \n \n• Mr John Harbinson, who  died on 18 May 1997; \n \n• Mr Raymond McCord Junior, who died on 09 November \n1997 (whose death led to this investigation); \n \n• Mr Thomas English, who died on 31 October 2000. \n \n \n6.7 The Police Ombudsman’s investigators also identified less \nsignificant intelligence implicating Informant 1 in five other murders. \nIn some cases, there is only one piece of intelligence, which police \nhave not rated as reliable. \n \n        6.8 Intelligence was found linking informants, and in particular \nInformant 1, to ten attempted murders between 1989 and 2002. \n \n 6.9 Intelligence was also found which implicated Informant 1 in 72 \ndifferent other crimes between 1991 and 2003.  They include the \nfollowing crimes: \n \n• Armed Robbery     3 \n• Arson       2 \n• Assault/Grievous Bodily Harm   5 \n• Conspiracy to murder    1 \n• Control/use of bombing equipment  4 \n• Criminal Damage     1 \n• Drug dealing               17 \n• Extortion      1 \n \n30 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Hijacking      1 \n• Intimidation      3 \n• Kidnap      1 \n• Possession of firearms    7 \n• “Punishment” attacks            13 \n• “Punishment” shootings   10 \n• Targeting      2 \n• Threats to kill      1 \n \n6.10 There was also information implicating informants, associated with \nInformant 1, in other crime. \n \n6.11 The Police Ombudsman has also viewed intelligence reports \nrelating to murder, in which Informant 1 is alleged to have destroyed \nsignificant evidence, and to have advised others to destroy \nevidence after murder, and how to avoid detection.  \n \n6.12 The Police Ombudsman has recently received information which \nmay link Informant 1 to another murder. Police did not have this \ninformation, but the Police Ombudsman has now ensured that \nPSNI are aware of it. \n \n6.13 When Mr McCord made his complaint Informant 1 had a lengthy \ncriminal record. \n \n6.14  24 police officers were interviewed under criminal caution, some on \nmore than one occasion. Most of the officers involved in the cases \nin question have retired. Some subsequently refused to co-operate \nwith the investigation, in areas in which they were not viewed as \nsuspects and could not therefore be compelled to be interviewed. \n \n \n31 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n6.15 These matters have been the subject of files which the Police \nOmbudsman has sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the \ncourse of this investigation. \n \n \n \n32 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nREVIEW OF THE POLICE \nOMBUDSMAN’S \nINVESTIGATION \n \n7.1 In accordance with good practice, in early 2005 the Police Ombudsman \ncommissioned an independent review of Operation Ballast by an \nexternal consultant. This review was carried out in March 2005 by a \nformer Detective Chief Superintendent with Hampshire Constabulary, \nwho was Chair of both the ACPO Computer Crime Unit and the UK \nInternet Crime Forum. \n \n7.2 In his review, the consultant described the analytical work undertaken by \nthe Police Ombudsman’s office as “outstanding” and said of the \nanalytical product: \n \n“it charts and provides provenance for all the major lines of enquiry and \nillustrates very graphically the issues” \n \n7.3  In his Conclusions, the reviewing officer made the following overall \ncomments about Operation Ballast: \n \n“Within the parameters determined by the Terms of Reference and the \ncircumstances affecting the investigation generally, there is nothing to \nidentify it as being managed other than professionally and well.” \n \n \n \n33 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n7.4   He also noted that the PSNI had shown an: \n“obvious lack of enthusiasm for co-operating fully with the Police \nOmbudsman in the Operation Ballast investigation.” \n \n7.5   The consultant then went on to conclude: \n \n“No obvious and potentially positive lines of enquiry have been \noverlooked by the SIO”. \n \n  \n \n34 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nDIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED \nDURING THIS INVESTIGATION \n \nLack of Co-operation and Time Delay \n \n8.1 The main difficulty encountered during Operation Ballast has been \nthe refusal of a number of retired RUC / PSNI senior officers to co-\noperate with this enquiry, despite the fact that the Police \nOmbudsman took a number of steps to facilitate the needs of these \nretired officers: \n \n• It was made clear to a number of these officers,  who \nwere not suspected of criminality, that they would be \ntreated as witnesses, and were simply being asked to \nprovide an explanation of Special Branch and CID \ninternal practices during this period;  \n \n• The investigators offered to meet these retired officers at \nvenues with which they would be comfortable, at  times \nwhich would suit them; \n \n• The personal details and addresses of retired officers \nwould be treated as sensitive information and protected \naccordingly; \n \n• Officers were advised of area for questioning and \nprovided with significant disclosure of information at their \nrequest.  Despite this, the majority of them failed even to \nreply. \n \n \n35 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n8.2 The Police Ombudsman was particularly concerned that retired \nsenior officers, who had had significant responsibilities within Special \nBranch and who undoubtedly could have assisted this enquiry, \nrefused to do so. Among those who refused were two retired \nAssistant Chief Constables, seven Detective Chief Superintendents \nand two Detective Superintendents. No senior officer has taken total \nresponsibility for the management of Informant 1 during the period \nunder investigation.  \n \n8.3 Three retired officers were arrested because they would not attend \nvoluntarily for an interview under criminal caution. A fourth officer, \nwho was to be arrested but was away at the time, attended for \nvoluntary interview under criminal caution when he returned.   \n \n8.4 Some retired officers did assist the investigation, and were helpful. \nOfficers who were interviewed varied a great deal in the manner in \nwhich they responded to questions. Some, including some retired \nofficers dealt with challenging questions in a professional manner.  \n \n8.5 Others, including some serving officers, gave evasive, contradictory, \nand on occasion farcical answers to questions. On occasion those \nanswers indicated either a significant failure to understand the law, or \ncontempt for the law. On other occasions the investigation \ndemonstrated conclusively that what an officer had told the Police \nOmbudsman’s investigators was completely untrue. \n \n8.6 The evidence indicates that there was a major failure to ensure the \nproper management of Informant 1 and other informants. This \ninvestigation has also identified significant irregularities in the \nmanagement of informants. However it has not been possible, \nbecause of the deficit in evidence, to attribute those failings \n \n36 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nspecifically to individual officers.  Most of these senior officers have \nnot given any explanation of their roles, and have not made \nthemselves accountable. They have portrayed themselves as victims \nrather than public servants, as though the public desire for an \nexplanation of what happened during the period under investigation \nwas unjustified. Their refusal to co-operate is indicative of disregard \nfor the members of families of murder victims from both sides of the \ncommunity. In addition to this, their refusal to co-operate has had the \neffect of lengthening the investigation, and of depriving the public of \ntheir understanding of what happened.  \n \n8.7 Police Ombudsman investigators have sometimes had to wait an \nexcessive amount of time for replies to their requests for information. \nThe Police Ombudsman accepts that this investigation coincided with \na period of significant restructuring within PSNI. The Police \nOmbudsman also acknowledges that demands for intelligence \nmaterial came not only from this and other Police Ombudsman \ninvestigations, but also from Public Enquiries and other \ninvestigations.  \n \n8.8 However, there are some examples where the Police Ombudsman \nhas had to wait for periods ranging from a year to two and a half \nyears before PSNI was able confirm the answer to specific requests. \nThere were also many occasions on which it took the PSNI three or \nfour months to answer a question. This had the cumulative effect of \ndelaying the investigation. It was particularly noticeable during the \nearlier period of the investigation.  \n \n8.9 There were lengthy delays in providing the Police Ombudsman with \ninformation about financial payments to informant 1 and others. \nThere was clear resistance initially to the delivery of this information.  \n \n \n37 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n8.10 There were significant delays in the supply of information where the \nPolice Ombudsman requested PSNI to supply informant identities \nand initially the Police were reluctant to supply such information.  The \nmatter was resolved when the Chief Constable provided the required \ninformation.  \n \n8.11 There were lengthy delays in the process of identifying and \ncommunicating with retired officers and in seeking to arrange \nmeetings with them, and on occasion in arranging meetings with \nserving officers.  \n \n8.12 All these factors contributed to delays in the production of this \nReport.  \n \n8.13 However, following concerns articulated by the Police Ombudsman to \nthe PSNI and as a result of changes to senior management in 2003, \nparticularly of Intelligence Branch, these matters improved a great \ndeal. \n \n \nPoor Record-Keeping \n \n8.14  A further significant obstacle to this investigation has been the \ngenerally poor standard of record-keeping within Special Branch over \nmany years, and the failure to document, or to document properly, \nmatters including key pieces of intelligence in relation to murders. As \na consequence, in part, of the lack of information storage facilities, \ninformation retrieval was on occasion very difficult. It was often \ndifficult to establish where in the police estate documentation might \nhave been stored. \n \n \n38 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n8.15 Material which was retained was on occasions recorded in a selective \nmanner which did not reflect the information given to police. \nImportant documentation, which should have been retained, was \nunavailable to the Police Ombudsman’s investigators. The Tasking \nand Co-ordinating Groups, (which were the most senior decision \nmaking groups responsible for Special Branch operations) routinely \ndestroyed all material relating to their decision-making processes. \n \n8.16 Despite the request for PSNI to provide the Police Ombudsman with \nall material on Informant 1, some material was only uncovered by \nPolice Ombudsman investigators during computer searches. Other \nmaterial was found by Police Ombudsman investigators in the course \nof the investigation, including material retrieved during searches by \nPolice Ombudsman investigators.  \n \n8.17 Police Ombudsman investigators have established that there were no \nclear auditable financial records prior to April 2002. The police \nmanagement of funds paid to informants lacked any clear structure, \nwas totally inadequate, lacked transparency and had no audit \nprocesses. This made it very difficult to identify the extent of \npayments to informant 1, reasons for payments and details in relation \npayments made. \n \n39 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nMissing, Lost and Destroyed Documentation \n \n8.18 In the course of this investigation it emerged that a number of \nimportant documents were either missing, lost or destroyed.  This \nalso had the effect of obstructing the investigation. These documents \nincluded murder files, murder investigation decision logs, intelligence \ndocuments, and all original material relating to significant pro-active \noperations  \n \n8.19 Some material was destroyed routinely by Special Branch who had \nno effective systems for document retention.  \n \n40 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION TWO \n \nTHE MURDER OF RAYMOND \nMcCORD JUNIOR AND THE \nSUBSEQUENT  INVESTIGATION \nBY THE POLICE \n \n9.1 On the morning of Sunday 09 November 1997, Raymond McCord \nJunior was found beaten to death in Ballyduff Quarry, Newtownabbey. It \nwas a brutal attack. A concrete block was used to kill Mr McCord. \n \n9.2 Mr McCord Junior’s father, also Mr Raymond McCord, in his statement \nof complaint alleged that police, over a number of years, acted in such a \nway as to protect informants from being fully accountable to the law. It \nincluded the following specific allegations: \n \n• that a senior UVF figure had ordered the murder of his son, and \nthat this individual was a police informant; \n \n• that police had failed to carry out a thorough investigation of his \nson’s murder, and had failed to keep him updated about their \ninvestigation; \n \n• that no-one had been arrested or charged with the murder of his \nson. Mr McCord alleged that this was because the man who \nordered the murder was a police informant, and that this \nindividual, and those working for him, had been protected from \narrest and prosecution for a number of years; \n \n41 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n• that unidentified police knew something was going to happen to \nRaymond McCord Junior, but that they did not warn him or his \nfamily about this danger to protect the police informant who was \nresponsible for the murder. \n \nThe Murder   \n \n9.3 On 18 July 1997 Raymond McCord Junior had been stopped at Belfast \nDocks with a consignment of cannabis, which he had brought over on a \nferry from Scotland. He had been remanded in custody from 18 July \nuntil he was released on bail on 13 August 1997, and he continued to \nsign his bail until the week of his death. \n \n9.4 Police information indicates that Raymond McCord Junior had brought \nthe cannabis into Northern Ireland on behalf of Informant 1, who was \ntravelling in a separate vehicle with another person when Raymond \nMcCord was stopped by the police. It also indicates that UVF members \nsuspected Raymond McCord Junior of being an informant. \n \n9.5 On the afternoon of Saturday 08 November 1997, Raymond McCord \nJunior went to visit the Maze prison to visit a prisoner with other people. \nInformant 1 attended the meeting which occurred.  \n \n9.6  Raymond McCord Junior’s movements on the Saturday evening \nleading up to his death are not clear. Police documentation suggests \nthat Mr McCord was taken away by other men that night and killed.  \n \n9.7 Police documentation, received over the hours and days following Mr \nMcCord’s murder, indicates that Mr McCord died following instructions \nissued by Informant 1, following a dispute over the drugs for which Mr \nMcCord was previously arrested, and that Informant 1’s creditors \n \n42 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nthreatened to inform the UVF senior hierarchy of his involvement in \ndrugs. The information names those involved in the crime and gives \ndetails about it. Other information provided to both CID and Special \nBranch corroborates this information. \n \n9.8 Special Branch were not in contact with Informant 1 whilst he was in \nprison. \n \n9.9 A 2005 PSNI review of the McCord murder confirmed that Informant 1 \nis the main suspect for ordering the murder, and that Man D is the main \nsuspect for carrying it out. \n \n \nThe Police Investigation of Raymond McCord Junior’s Murder \n \n9.10 Suspicion initially fell on the UDA as being responsible for this murder, \nbut as a result of Special Branch and CID intelligence, it became clear \nthat it was a murder carried out within the UVF. \n \nIntelligence Matters   \n \n9.11 The Senior Investigating Officer has provided a witness statement to \nthe Police Ombudsman about the murder investigation. He said that the \nday after the discovery of McCord’s body, specific information was \nprovided by Special Branch about the murder. He was told that some of \nthis information names those who murdered Raymond McCord Junior.  \n \n9.12 The Senior Investigating Officer states that Raymond McCord Junior \nwas caught with a consignment of drugs, and that Informant 1 lost \n£50,000 worth of drugs because of this. The Detective Chief Inspector \nstates that Detective Sergeant E or Detective Constable P from Special \nBranch, Informant 1’s handlers, attended the Case Conference for this \n \n43 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nmurder, and provided this information. The Detective Chief Inspector \nalso states that Special Branch provided information about three named \nindividuals who were involved in the murder on Informant 1’s behalf. \n \n9.13 It is clear that the available information was passed on to CID by \nSpecial Branch. \n \nPrison Issues \n \n9.14 On 11 November Man D was a possible suspect, and CID investigators \nreceived further information on November 14 that Man D had been \ninvolved in the murder. On 17 November, an Acting CID Detective \nInspector and a Detective Constable went to the Maze Prison to speak \nwith prison authorities about the potential arrest of Man D and the \nsearch of his cell. They met senior prison officers. \n \n9.15 The Acting Detective Inspector has provided a witness statement to the \nPolice Ombudsman and a police report which he wrote about this \nmeeting. In both he says that the prison authorities informed him it was \na “non-starter” to consider searching Man D’s cell for his boots and \nclothing, as this would cause a riot. \n \n9.16 He was told that the wings in the Maze Prison were effectively under \nthe day-to-day control of the respective paramilitary groups. This meant \nthat paramilitaries were free to go in and out of the cells of other \nprisoners on their wing. Prison officers were not present in the wings \nduring the day, other than to do a head count of prisoners, once in the \nmorning and again in the evening. \n \n9.17 He was told that the Maze Prison authorities acted in liaison with the \n“Commanding Officer” of each paramilitary wing, to arrange for arrests \nand searches to take place. Generally, the prison authorities were able \n \n44 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nto arrange for a prisoner to be produced for arrest, because if this did \nnot happen the other prisoners would be refused visits and parcels.  \n \n9.18 He was told that searches were more difficult, as prisoners could move \nfreely between cells.  In order to be effective a search would have to \nexamine numerous cells, if not the whole wing. Attempts to carry out \nsearches without the consent of the paramilitary groups had resulted in \nmajor riots, which had caused extensive damage to the prison and \nthreatened the lives of prison officers. \n \n9.19 The Acting Detective Inspector’s report noted that prison authorities told \nhim it would take over 100 prison officers to deal with such a search \noperation, that there would be a danger to the officers involved, and that \nthere was the threat of a major riot which would cause extensive \ndamage to the prison wing. The report noted that, as a result, the prison \nauthorities would not give clearance for such a search.  \n \n9.20 He said that the alternative which was offered was that Man D could be \nproduced for arrest, by way of the prison authorities, liaising with the \n“Commanding Officer” on the UVF wing.  This was the option which \npolice took. Man D was produced for arrest, but his cell was not \nsearched, and his clothes and boots were not seized for forensic \nexamination. \n \n9.21 In January 1998 the Detective Superintendent with responsibility for the \ninvestigation, wrote a report to the Regional Head of CID. He noted that \nthe Government had recently announced a review of security at the \nMaze Prison. He alleged that it had been “impossible” for police to \nexamine the clothes they believed Man D was wearing at the time of the \nMcCord murder. He wrote: \n \n \n45 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n“This would seem to strike at the heart of the whole concept of the ‘rule \nof law’. The irony is that this ‘No Go’ area for criminal investigations is \none created by the Criminal Justice system.  \n \nI would recommend that this problem be brought to the attention of \neither HM Inspector of Prisons or the Northern Ireland Office. As the \nnumber of terrorists availing of home leave is not likely to reduce I have \nno doubt that we will be facing similar problems in the future.”  \n \n9.22 The Police Ombudsman’s investigators have also taken a statement \nfrom the senior prison officer. He agreed with some elements of the \nreport by the Detective Inspector. However, he stated that at no time did \nhe refuse clearance for any police searches, as it was not within his \npower to do so. \n \n9.23 He stated that he had an informal meeting with the CID officers, in \nwhich he outlined the potential difficulties which any search operation \ncould present. However, he stated that there was a set procedure for \npolice to carry out searches in the prison, which involved them \nsubmitting a written request authorised by an Inspector.  \n \n9.24 He stated that he never received any such formal request to search \nMan D’s cell. He also stated that in November 1997 he did not have a \nsearch team available to carry out such a task. He stated that no \noutside agency influenced the advice he had given to police, and that \nhe never received any follow-up contact from senior police about this \nissue. \n \n9.25 In reply, the police have said that there was no such thing as an \n“informal” meeting around this kind of issue, and that the prison \nauthorities had point-blank refused to allow a search. \n \n \n46 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n9.26 There is no further documentary evidence to indicate why police made \nno further attempt to search for Man D’s clothing inside the prison. \nLegal processes were available to enable the police to gain access to \nthe prison. The Police Ombudsman considers that police did not make \nevery possible attempt to recover evidence from within the prison. \n \n9.27 Police knew that Man D was in prison. However there is no evidence \nthat any attempt was made to secure other potential evidence from \nwithin the prison. \n \nArrests \n \n9.28 On 19 November 1997 police arrested a number of suspected UVF \nmembers for the murder of Raymond McCord Junior. Man D was \namong those arrested and questioned. He did not reply to their \nquestions. \n \n9.29 Man B and Man C were arrested that day. During interview, police \nasked Man B about the whereabouts of vehicles which may have been \nused in the murder. There was evidence that attempts had been made \nto remove opportunities to recover forensic evidence, including gravel, \nfrom the vehicle. It was found burned out some days later. \n \n9.30 On 25 February 1998 police arrested Informant 1 in the Maze prison. \nPolice questioned Informant 1 about Conspiracy to Murder, putting it to \nhim that he had ordered the murder of Raymond McCord Junior. \nInformant 1 denied any involvement in the murder, and he failed to reply \nto most of the police questions. Informant 1 was released from police \ncustody and returned to the Maze the next day. \n \n \n \n47 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nFailings In The Investigation Of The Murder Of Raymond \nMcCord Junior \n \n9.31 The following failings have been identified in the investigation of the \nmurder of Raymond McCord Junior: \n \n• There was no search of Man D’s cell, or of the cell block \nthrough which he had freedom of movement. Following the \nalleged inability of the Prison Service to facilitate the \nnecessary search, police did not pursue the recovery of \nitems belonging to Man D, which may have provided forensic \nopportunities; \n \n• There were some delays in arresting those who had been \nnamed as being responsible for Mr McCord’s murder. \n \n• Police did not give any consideration to any pro-active \ninvestigation within the prison; \n \n• A report of suspicious activity at the quarry on the day of the \nmurder was not followed up until March 1998; \n \n• There is some material which indicates some contact \nbetween specific police officers and Mr Raymond McCord, \nparticularly during the days immediately following the \nmurder. However there is no record detailing either the policy \nin relation to the updating of Mr McCord or that any \nconsideration was given to the appointment of a dedicated \nfamily liaison officer, or the identification of a single point of \ncontact to whom Mr McCord might refer.   \n \n \n48 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nConclusions Of The Police Ombudsman About The Allegations \nMade By Mr Raymond McCord About The Death Of His Son \n \n9.32 Allegation1: that a senior UVF figure had ordered the murder of his son, \nand that this individual was a police informant.   \n \nFinding: The Police Ombudsman can confirm that a police \ninformant is a suspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son. She \ncannot confirm or deny who that individual is.  \n \n9.33 Allegation 2: that police had failed to carry out a thorough investigation \nof his son’s murder, and had failed to keep him updated about their \ninvestigation. \n \nFindings: The Police Ombudsman has identified failures in the \ninvestigation of Mr McCord’s son’s murder. These failures may \nhave significantly reduced the possibility of anyone being \nprosecuted for the murder.  \n \nThere is some material which indicates some contact between \nspecific police officers and Mr McCord, particularly during the \ndays immediately following the murder. There has been a failure \nby those supervising the conduct of the police investigation to \nconsider the benefit of identifying at the very least a single point of \ncontact for Mr McCord. Such provision may have allowed the \ninvestigation to progress more effectively. This allegation is \ntherefore substantiated.  \n \n9.34 Allegation 3: that no-one had been arrested or charged with the murder \nof his son. Mr McCord alleged that this was because the man who \nordered the murder was a police informant, and that this individual, and \n \n49 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nthose working for him, had been protected from arrest and prosecution \nfor a number of years. \n \nFindings: A number of people were arrested for Raymond McCord \nJunior’s murder.  No one has been charged with the murder. There \nis no evidence that anyone has been protected from arrest for the \nmurder of Raymond McCord Junior. \n \nWith reference to Mr McCord’s allegation that a police informant \nhad ordered his son’s murder, and that this individual and those \nworking for him had been protected from arrest and prosecution \nfor years the Police Ombudsman conducted an extensive \ninvestigation which is detailed in this Report. It is clear that much \nintelligence was disregarded by police and that they continued to \nuse Informant 1 despite his criminal record and the extensive \nintelligence they held in respect of alleged serious criminality, \nbecause he had value to them as an informant.  This was wrong. \n \nThis allegation is therefore substantiated with the exception, \nfirstly, of that part of it which refers to police failure to arrest \nanyone for Raymond McCord Junior’s murder, and secondly, of \nthe fact that, whilst the Police Ombudsman can confirm that an \ninformer is a suspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son, she \ncannot confirm or deny who that individual is.   \n \n9.35 Allegation 4: that unidentified police knew something was going to \nhappen to Raymond McCord Junior, but that they did not warn him or \nhis family about this danger to protect the police informant who was \nresponsible for the murder. \n \nFinding: The Police Ombudsman has found no evidence or \nintelligence to support this allegation. It is not substantiated. \n \n50 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION THREE \n    \nINTELLIGENCE LINKING \nNFORMANTS TO MURDER \n \n10.1 Mr McCord alleged that those involved in the murder of his son had \npreviously been involved in serious crime, but had been protected \nto enable them to continue to act as informants. \n \n10.2 The Police Ombudsman has identified intelligence held by PSNI, \nwhich when analyzed indicated informant involvement in 10 \nmurders. There was a failure in the dissemination of some of the \nintelligence gathered, and inadequate police assessment, and \nconsequential inadequate police action in relation to the possible \nlinks or involvement of police informants in these deaths. (These \nmurders were not the primary subject of this enquiry, but came to \nthe attention of investigators in the course of the analysis of \nintelligence relating to identified informants.)  \n \n10.3 Records held within the RUC/PSNI implicate, to varying degrees, \nidentified individuals, whom this statement will refer to as \ninformants, in a number of deaths. That linkage of informants to \nmurders is alleged to have taken a variety of forms from actual \ninvolvement in the murder, to assisting offenders and conspiracy to \npervert the course of justice  \n \n10.4 This Report will outline the situation in respect of those murders. \n \n \n \n51 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nThe Murder Of Mr Peter McTasney \n \n \n10.5 Mr Peter McTasney was murdered at Bawnmore in Belfast on 24 \nFebruary 1991; he was 26 years old. The UVF later said they \ncarried out the attack. The murder weapon was not found at the \ntime. \n \n10.6 Although the murder file contains no record of the involvement of \nInformant 1, there is evidence that police were told that Informant 1 \nhad taken part in the murder. \n \n10.7 Two men, Man E and Man F, who were both members of the UVF,  \nwere  connected to the crime when it was established that the gun \nused in the murder attempt on Intended Victim One, for which they \nwere being questioned by police, had been linked to Mr \nMcTasney’s murder.  \n \n10.8 Although the murder file does not make any mention of him, \nInformant 1 was also arrested and interviewed.  \n \n10.9 Police Ombudsman investigators have uncovered other police \ndocumentation which indicates that Informant 1 was suspected of \nbeing involved in the murder and that he was arrested in \nSeptember 1991 and questioned in Castlereagh Holding Centre. \n \nSham Interview \n \n10.10 Informant 1 was interviewed a total of 19 times. The main interview \nteam consisted of Informant 1’s own ‘handlers’, Detective Sergeant \nD of Special Branch and Detective Constable A of CID. This \n \n52 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \npartnership conducted four of Informant 1’s first five interviews. In \naddition, one of them would also usually have sat in on any of the \ninterviews conducted by other officers.  The other interviewing \nofficers were Special Branch officers. \n \n10.11 Detective Sergeant D has stated that he and Detective Constable \nA “babysat” Informant 1 through these interviews. \n \n10.12 He said that Detective Constable A completed the official interview \nnotes, which did not reflect the actual content of the interview, and \nthat the notes would have given the impression that police \nquestioned Informant 1 about the offences he was supposedly \ndetained for and that Informant 1 did not answer relevant \nquestions. He also said that Detective Constable A was more used \nto completing interview notes for this purpose. \n \n10.13 Detective Sergeant D authorised Informant 1’s release without \ncharge on 24 September. \n \nInformation Not Disclosed To Director Of Public Prosecutions. \n \n10.14 A combined file for the murder of Mr McTasney and the attempted \nmurder of Intended Victim One was prepared for the Director of \nPublic Prosecutions. CID asked Special Branch to check their \nrecords to ensure compliance with the requirement to inform the \nDirector of Public Prosecutions of any involvement of police \ninformants in the matters.  \n \n10.15 The then Deputy Assistant Chief Constable for Special Branch \nreplied that no such disclosure was required, despite the fact that \nthere was a clear obligation to do so.  \n \n \n53 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n10.16 The Public Prosecution Service has stated it can find no trace of \nany file which may have been prepared to inform the director about \nsensitive matters, nor any other documentation which would show \nthat the Director of Public Prosecutions was aware that an \ninformant was involved in this incident. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n54 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF \nVICTIM 1 \n \n11.1 In 1991 Informant 1 admitted to police that he was involved in an \nattempt to murder a man two days earlier. He provided this \nadmission to both his Special Branch and CID ‘handlers’.  \n \n11.2 The Special Branch record of this conversation states that \nInformant 1 had admitted being involved in an aborted murder \nattempt in 1991. Informant 1 said that he and Man F hijacked a \ncar. Informant 1 said he held the owners of the car while Man F \ndrove to pick up two gunmen – Man E and Man G. They used \nspecific guns in the attack. \n \n11.3 However the CID record of this conversation makes no mention \nof Informant 1’s personal involvement in the murder attempt. It \nstates that the UVF hijacked a car, but does not record that \nInformant 1 imprisoned the car’s occupants. The document does, \nhowever, provide further detail about the planned murder attempt \nin the future. \n \n11.4 Informant 1 later provided further information about the proposed \nmurder attempt. \n \n11.5 Police knew that the murder attempt was to go ahead on a \nspecific date. They knew also how the murder was to be carried \nout. \n \n11.6 A surveillance unit looked on as the car used in this incident was \nstolen from its owners. An individual approached a house, and \n \n55 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nwhen the front door was opened he put his hand in his pocket as \nthough he had a gun. From the material available it is likely that \nthis individual, who was not arrested at the time, was Informant 1. \nHe held the occupants of the house hostage. \n \n11.7 At around 21:55 hours on Monday 16 September police stopped \na car containing Man E, Man F and Man G. There was a loaded \npistol and a sledgehammer in the car, along with gloves and \nbalaclavas. Nearby, police found a loaded Ruger pistol, which \nhad been thrown out of the car window. A subsequent police \nreport confirmed that this weapon was also used in the attempted \nmurders of Intended Victims Two, Three and Four in 1989 and \n1990. \n \n11.8 All three men admitted they were on their way to murder a \nCatholic. Man E and Man F went separately with police to identify \nthe house of their murder target, whom police identified as \nIntended Victim One.  \n \n11.9 Informant 1’s main Special Branch handler at the time has told \nPolice Ombudsman investigators that a number of people, \nincluding Informant 1, Man E,   Man  F and Man G were arrested \nin connection with the murder attempt.  \n \n11.10  Applications were made to the Secretary of State to enable the \ncontinued detention of the suspects. Police documentation shows \nthat in interview Informant 1 “would not speak in relation to any \nactivity in relation to this hijacking”.  Police also note that \nInformant 1 “is a well known member of the UVF in the North \nBelfast area and believed involved in sectarian murders”. The \ndocumentation notes that he was released without charge. \n \n \n56 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n11.11 Police asked the Northern Ireland Forensic Science Laboratory to \ncompare the gun seized during these arrests with bullets \nrecovered from the murder of Mr. Peter McTasney earlier that \nyear.  The gun and bullets matched. There was therefore a link \nbetween Mr. McTasney’s murder and the attempted murder of \nIntended Victim One.  \n \n11.12 Man E, and Man F were subsequently convicted in relation to the \nmurder and this attempted murder. \n \nFindings In Relation To The Murder Of Mr McTasney And The \nAttempted Murder Of Intended Victim 1 \n \n         11.13 There is no documentation to indicate that Informant 1 was \nproperly investigated for the murder of Mr McTasney or for his \nrole in the attempted murder. \n \n11.14 No records have been found of the allegations upon which an \napplication was made to the Secretary of State in the McTasney \ninvestigation.  The records implicating Informant 1 in murder and \nthe four attempted murders have been destroyed, thus protecting \nInformant 1 from potential prosecution. \n \n11.15 The police interview process was seriously flawed and contrary to \nany model of ethical policing. It could also have the effect of \nundermining any subsequent criminal prosecution. \n \n11.16 Informant 1 provided information which saved the life of Intended \nVictim 1 and resulted in the arrest and convictions of people who \nwere going to kill him. However the information indicated that \nInformant 1 was allowed to engage in a hijacking and attempted \nmurder. There is no documentation recording authority for him to \n \n57 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nact as a Participating Informant in these most serious crimes. Nor \nis there any documentation of the control and management of this \nsituation, which involved a threat to life. \n \n11.17 Special Branch failed to disclose the possible criminal role of \nInformant 1 for the file prepared for the Director of Public \nProsecutions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n58 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nATTEMPTED MURDER OF \nVICTIM FIVE \n \n12.1 In September 1992, UVF gunmen fired shots through the window of a \nhome in Belfast. No one was injured. Police identified the vehicle which \nthe gunmen used after they abandoned their getaway car as belonging \nto Man I \n \n12.2 Police searched Man I’s home that evening and recovered the \nweapons used in the attack, as well as balaclavas and other items. \nMan I admitted being involved in this murder attempt and was \nsubsequently charged and convicted. \n \n12.3 Acting on information received, which police cannot now find, police \narrested Informant 1 and others in October 1992 and questioned them \nabout the attempted murder of Intended Victim Five. Two other \nindividuals named as being involved were not arrested. They were \nsenior members of the UVF. Other people were convicted of matters \nrelated to Intended Victim Five’s attempted murder. \n \n12.4 Informant 1 was interviewed at Castlereagh Holding Centre by his \nhandler, Detective Constable A, and another officer. Applications for \nthe extension of his detention were made to the Secretary of State. \nInformant 1 was subsequently released without charge. \n \nFinding of the Police Ombudsman In Relation to the Attempted \nMurder of Intended Victim Five \n \n12.5 There is a marked similarity between the accounts of the alleged \ninvolvement by Informant 1 in the crimes dealt with in paragraphs 10, \n11 and 13 of this Report. There is an equally marked similarity in the \n \n59 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nway in which Informant 1 was dealt with during interview and was \nreleased. There is no evidence that Informant 1’s alleged participation \nin this crime was authorised. \n \n12.6 The unexplained absence of the information upon which the \nApplication for Extension of Detention was made appears to be \nindicative of a pattern of collusion. The information has been \nmishandled in the first instance and then destroyed or suppressed thus \nprotecting Informant 1 from potential prosecution. \n \n \n60 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDER OF MS SHARON \nMCKENNA \n \n13.1 At 1730 on Sunday 17 January 1993, a Catholic woman, Ms Sharon \nMcKenna, was shot dead at the home of her Protestant friend in \nBelfast.  \n   \n13.2 Before the murder, a caller rang a restaurant, and ordered a take-away \nto be delivered to an address nearby. When the delivery driver arrived \nwith the order, two men in balaclavas hijacked his car. The car was \ndriven to the friend’s house. \n \n13.3 The gunmen rang the doorbell and entered the house. Ms McKenna \nwas shot and suffered major injuries which led rapidly to her death. \n \n13.4 CID arrested a number of suspected UFF members, at around 2200 \nhours on the evening of the murder, 17 January 1993. At 1700 hours \non 18 January 1993, the UFF suspects were released, because their \nalibis had been checked and appeared genuine, and “new intelligence \nwas coming to hand”. \n \n13.5  At approximately 1500 hours on 18 January 1993, the UVF claimed \nresponsibility for Ms Sharon McKenna’s murder. A number of UVF \nsuspects were subsequently arrested on 26 January 1993, including \nInformant 1.  \n \n13.6 At the time of Ms McKenna’s murder, Special Branch and CID jointly \nhandled Informant 1. Detective Sergeant E and Detective Constable C \nwere Informant 1’s Special Branch handlers; Detective Constable A \nwas Informant 1’s CID handler. Detective Sergeant M was no longer a \n \n61 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nhandler for Informant 1 at this point, although he remained informed \nabout him through Detective Constable A \n \nDetective Sergeant M’s Written Material \n  \n13.7 In 2002 Detective Sergeant M supplied to the Police Ombudsman’s \nInvestigators, material about several incidents, including an account \nwritten by him about Informant 1, and about the murder of Ms Sharon \nMcKenna . \n \n13.8 In this written account Detective Sergeant M made allegations that \nInformant 1 admitted that he was a gunman in the murder, and that \npolice covered up his role at the request of Special Branch, stating that \nhe was the second gunman involved in the murder of Sharon \nMcKenna, but that he did not pull the trigger, referring to another \nSpecial Branch informant [who was not named] as the murderer.  \n \n13.9 There were three meetings between Informant 1 and his handlers after \nthis murder.  \n \n13.10 The first meeting was on 18 January 1993.  Detective Sergeant M \nwrote that Detective Constable A had contacted Informant 1 and \nInformant 1 had said that he was involved and that he wanted meet \nDetective Constable A. A senior CID officer then allegedly approved \nthe meeting. It was also alleged that this officer told Detective Sergeant \nM that information was already in the system naming Informant 1 as \nthe gunman who killed Sharon McKenna. Detective Sergeant M does \nnot identify this “senior CID officer”. At the time of this first meeting \ntherefore police had identified Informant 1 as a suspect for the murder.  \n \n13.11 Detective Sergeant M wrote that Detective Constable A and he met \nand spoke to Informant 1 who stated that he was the second gunman. \n \n62 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nDetective Sergeant M claims he put it to Informant 1 that he killed \nSharon McKenna, but that Informant 1 denied this. Detective Sergeant \nM writes that he told Informant 1 he would be arrested in a very short \ntime. Detective Sergeant M writes that he and Detective Constable A \nthen “drove to brief senior police and to receive further instructions”.   \n \n \n13.12 Detective Sergeant M’s police journal entry for 18 January 1993\nconfirms that this meeting occurred. It also confirms that Informant 1 \nadmitted involvement in the murder. \n  \n13.13 A retired officer who was a uniformed Chief Inspector at the time of \nSharon McKenna’s murder told Police Ombudsman investigators that \nhe remembered seeing Detective Sergeant M looking withdrawn in the \npolice canteen around the time of the Sharon McKenna murder. This \ninformation was not contained in Detective Sergeant M’s private written \nmaterial. \n \n13.14 The retired officer said that Detective Sergeant M made an unsolicited \nremark to him, that one of his sources had admitted to being involved \nin the Sharon McKenna murder. The officer said that although he was \nan Inspector at the time, he did not have managerial responsibility for \nDetective Sergeant M, and that he did not take the conversation any \nfurther, as he believed it to be a matter for CID to resolve. This retired \nofficer has declined to make a witness statement to the Police \nOmbudsman about this incident. \n \n13.15 Detective Sergeant M wrote that a second meeting occurred on 19 \nJanuary 1993, between Informant 1, his two Special Branch handlers \nand Detective Constable A. Detective Constable A later told him about \nthe meeting. There is evidence in the journal of one of Informant 1’s \nhandlers that this meeting occurred. There is no other note of the \nmeeting. \n \n63 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n13.16 Detective Sergeant M wrote that Detective Constable A told him that \nInformant 1 had been agitated and started to bring up the topic of the \nSharon McKenna murder, but that he was stopped before he could say \nanything. The Special Branch handlers allegedly handed Informant 1 \nhundreds of pounds of spending money, for a foreign holiday. When \nInformant 1 again tried to talk about the murder of Ms McKenna, the \nSpecial Branch handlers interrupted him and did not allow him to talk \nabout it. Informant 1 then broke down and admitted that he shot \nSharon McKenna. The Special Branch officers allegedly said nothing in \nresponse. \n \n13.17 Detective Sergeant M wrote that he and Detective Constable A then \nmet with a CID Detective Superintendent, who allegedly told them that \nInformant 1 was the gunman who killed Sharon McKenna and that \nInformant 1 would be arrested “to keep everybody right, but the Branch \nfear he will admit it because he is so low at the moment”. He allegedly \nalso went on to say that Special Branch could not afford to lose \nInformant 1, as he was probably the most important intelligence asset \nin that UVF grouping. \n \n13.18 Detective Sergeant M writes that the CID Detective Superintendent told \nDetective Constable A and Detective Sergeant B that they would \ninterview Informant 1 about the Sharon McKenna murder, and that they \nwould do this “back-to-back” with two other CID officers, who would \nknow nothing about Informant 1’s position as a source and would be \ntrying to “break” him. The CID Detective Superintendent allegedly \ninstructed them to “guide” Informant 1 through his detention, give him \n“a shoulder to cry on”, and make sure that Informant 1 did not admit to \nthe murder. He also allegedly said that Informant 1 had to come in for \ninterview, because he had been named as a suspect, but that he would \nbe no good to Special Branch in prison. \n \n64 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n13.19 Detective Sergeant M writes that he refused to follow these \ninstructions, he made his feelings known and left the meeting.  \nDetective Constable A agreed to do as he was asked.  \n \n13.20 A third meeting on 20 January 1993 between Informant 1, Special \nBranch and CID is recorded in Detective Sergeant E’s journal. There is \nno documentation of this meeting by either Special Branch or CID \nofficers.  \n \nThe “Exceptional” Intelligence \n \n13.21 In the murder file the Deputy Senior Investigating Officer, records \nreceipt of intelligence from Special Branch naming nine people, \nincluding Informant 1, and other members of North Belfast and \nNewtownabbey UVF. \n \n13.22 Special Branch has no record of this key piece of intelligence in the \nmurder enquiry, which it provided to the Murder Investigation Team \nand which it described as “exceptional.”  Special Branch officers have \ninformed the Police Ombudsman that it would have been extremely \nunusual to describe intelligence as “exceptional”.   \n \n65 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nThe Arrest of Informant 1 and Others \n \n13.23 Nine days after the murder, police arrested Informant 1 in relation to \nthe Sharon McKenna murder. They also arrested the eight other \npeople named by Special Branch intelligence.  \n \n13.24 Informant 1 was detained for six days in Castlereagh and forensic \nsamples were taken from him. He was interviewed 37 times about the \nmurder of Sharon McKenna, but police records state that he refused to \ntalk about the murder. Detective Constable A and CID Detective \nSergeant GG conducted 19 of these 37 interviews. Another pair of CID \ndetectives conducted Informant 1’s other 18 interviews.  \n \n13.25 CID Detective Sergeant GG who interviewed Informant 1 about the \nSharon McKenna murder with Detective Constable A, said that “the \ndogs on the street” knew Informant 1 was a source, and he knew that \nDetective Constable A was one of Informant 1’s handlers. The \nDetective Sergeant confirmed that Detective Constable A had \npreviously told him that Informant 1 was one of his sources. \n \n13.26 Detective Sergeant GG said that he “felt like a gooseberry” sitting in on \nthe interview of Informant 1, as he knew that Informant 1 was Detective \nConstable A’s source and would say nothing of relevance in front of \nhim, adding that it was common practice to arrest a source who had \nprovided information about an incident, so as to provide cover for them. \n \n13.27 Detective Sergeant GG said he felt the interview was just going \nthrough the motions, as the arrest was probably just a cover for \nInformant 1 and that he knew Informant 1 was not going to say \nanything in front of him. \n \n13.28 Informant 1 was released without charge.  \n \n66 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n13.29 Information was subsequently received stating that Informant 1 had \ncommitted the murder of Ms McKenna, and that another informant was \ninvolved in the murder.  \n \n13.30 Before the murder of Sharon McKenna, police paid Informant 1 a \nmonthly retainer of £100 a month. In the weeks after the murder, this \nregular payment was increased to £160 a month. The increase in \nInformant 1’s monthly payments was authorised by a senior Special \nBranch officer.  \n \nPolice Ombudsman Interviews and Arrests \n \n13.31 The Police Ombudsman investigators interviewed many of the officers \ninvolved in handling Informant 1, and in the murder investigation.  \n \n13.32 Informant 1’s CID Handler, Detective Constable A, was arrested by \nPolice Ombudsman investigators, having repeatedly declined to be \ninterviewed voluntarily. He confirmed that he and Detective Sergeant M \nmet with Informant 1 on 18 January 1993, and that Informant 1 \nadmitted to being the second gunman in the murder. He could not \nrecall meeting Informant 1 with Special Branch on the following day. \n \n13.33 He said that he informed senior officers of Informant 1’s confession, \nalthough he refused to name whom he told. He added that he also \nsubmitted a written record of the meeting. No such documentation has \nbeen recovered. \n \n13.34 When asked why he did not arrest and caution Informant 1 following \nhis admission to Sharon McKenna’s murder, Detective Constable A \nclaimed that what Informant 1 told him was intelligence and not a \nconfession. He claimed during interview under caution and in the press \n \n67 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nthat no one had tried harder than he to put away Informant 1 for the \nmurder of Sharon McKenna.  He would not state who instructed him to \ninterview Informant 1.  He did confirm that Detective Sergeant M was \nasked to conduct the interview and refused. \n \n13.35 Detective Sergeant M was also arrested by the Police Ombudsman’s \ninvestigators, having repeatedly declined to be voluntarily interviewed \nunder caution. He confirmed that Informant 1 had admitted to being the \nsecond gunman during the murder of Ms McKenna. He had put it in his \nRUC Journal to bring it to the attention of senior police and that that \nwas where his responsibility ended. \n \n13.36 When questioned as to why he did not arrest Informant 1, when \nInformant 1 admitted to him that he had been the second gunman, he \nsaid that he did not consider it appropriate and that he would not have \nbeen permitted to arrest Informant 1. He stated that in Northern Ireland \nat that time (1993) Special Branch were in total control of the RUC, and \nthat the Walker Report (which was incorporated into an RUC Force \nOrder and which restricted the activities of police officers dealing with \ninformants) prevented him from arresting anyone other than in a ‘hot \npursuit’. He also stated that he did not view the comment from \nInformant 1 to amount to an admission, adding that in his opinion it was \nquite simply intelligence only.  He was adamant that he would have \narrested Informant 1 had he had the authority to do so \n \n13.37 Detective Sergeant M stated that he passed all the details to the CID \nDetective Superintendent B. He declined to answer questions over his \nprior allegations that the CID Detective Superintendent B had asked \nthat Informant 1 be guided through interview. He simply confirmed that \nhe refused to take part in the interview of Informant 1. \n \n \n68 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n13.38 Detective Constable A and Detective Sergeant M have recently taken \npart in separate television documentaries. They have both said that \nInformant 1 had said that he had taken part in the murder of Sharon \nMcKenna. In interview under caution concerning the allegations he had \nmade previously, both to the Police Ombudsman and in the media, \nDetective Sergeant M distanced himself from these accounts. He \nclaimed that his written account of the murder of Ms McKenna was \ninaccurate, an exaggeration and written when he was suffering from \ndepression. Nonetheless, he has recently repeated these allegations in \nthe media. \n \n13.39 The CID Detective Superintendent B was also arrested and interviewed \nby the Police Ombudsman’s investigators, having repeatedly declined \nto be interviewed voluntarily under caution. He confirmed that within \ndays of the murder, either or both Detective Sergeant M and Detective \nConstable A informed him that Informant 1 was involved in the murder. \nHe added that it may even have been another CID officer who told him \nof Informant 1’s role, but that the information definitely did not come \nfrom Special Branch. \n \n13.40 He stated that he would have briefed his own Detective Chief \nSuperintendent before going on to meet his own counterparts in \nSpecial Branch. He stated that it was his intention to seek authority to \narrest Informant 1. He said that he told the Special Branch Detective \nChief Superintendent L, and Detective Superintendent J, and Special \nBranch Detective Sergeant E, that one of their informants was believed \nto have been concerned in the murder of Sharon McKenna. He was \ngiven authority to arrest Informant 1. \n \n13.41 The CID Detective Superintendent B could offer no explanation why \nthere was no record whatsoever of the intelligence apparently passed \nto him by Detective Sergeant M and/or Detective Constable A, or of his \n \n69 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \ndiscussion with Special Branch, or of their granting authority to arrest \nInformant 1. \n \n13.42 The meeting with Informant 1 on 20 January 1993 was after authority \nto arrest Informant 1 had been granted. \n \n13.43 The CID Detective Superintendent B denied knowing Detective \nConstable A was one of Informant 1’s handlers and he denied all \nallegations put to him that he instructed there to be a cover up during \nthe interviews with Informant 1 over his role in the killing \n \n13.44 Other officers also denied knowledge of all or part of these events. CID \nDetective Chief Superintendent FF denied any knowledge that \nInformant 1 was an informant at the time and also denied any \nknowledge that he had admitted the murder. Special Branch Detective \nChief Inspector N also denied knowing that Informant 1 had admitted \nthe murder. However Detective Chief Inspector N stated that during the \ndays following the meeting between Detective Superintendent B and \nSpecial Branch on 19 January there was also discussion of the fact \nthat Informant 1 was involved. The Deputy Senior Investigating Officer, \nDetective Inspector EE, denied knowing that Informant 1 was an \ninformant.  The Special Branch Detective Superintendent J who was at \nthe meeting could recall nothing of relevance and had destroyed his \npolice journal some years previously.  \n \n13.45 Detective Constable C, one of informant 1’s handlers, who was at the \nmeeting on 19 January, stated categorically that Informant 1 did not \nconfess to the murder.  He claimed that Informant 1 provided no \nintelligence about the murder. Detective Sergeant E, another handler, \nwho was at the meetings on 19 and 20 January also said that \nInformant 1 did not admit to taking part in the murder. He said he would \nhave arrested Informant 1 had he admitted to the murder. In \n \n70 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \ncontradiction to Detective Constable C’s account, Detective Sergeant E \nclaimed that Informant 1 provided intelligence as to who may have \ncommitted the murder.   \n \n13.46 Detective Chief Inspector QQ, the CID Senior Investigating Officer of \nSharon McKenna’s murder, refused to co-operate with the Police \nOmbudsman. There were no grounds for his arrest. \n \n13.47 Two applications for the Extension of the Detention of Informant 1 were \nmade to the Secretary of State, However there is no identifiable \nintelligence to support these applications, as would normally be \nexpected. The officers who sought the applications can provide no \nexplanation as to what information they provided to the Secretary of \nState, and those same officers deny knowledge of Informant 1 at the \ntime. The two applications referred to are the only documents on the \nsource file of Informant 1 in relation to the murder of Sharon McKenna, \napart from the general intelligence Informant 1 provided some time \nafter the murder, which does not name those involved. It would have \nbeen expected that all the supporting intelligence, particularly the \nintelligence described as “exceptional,” would have appeared on \nInformant 1’s source file. The intelligence reports which both Detective \nConstable A and Detective Sergeant E claim to have submitted cannot \nbe found. \n \n 13.48 The Police Ombudsman has brought all of the above issues relating to \nthe murder of Sharon McKenna to the attention of the Director of Public \nProsecutions.  \n \n \n \n \n71 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nFindings of The Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Police \nInvestigation of the Murder Of Sharon McKenna \n \n13.49 The Police Ombudsman has confirmed that:  \n \n1. Informant 1 remains a main suspect for this murder, but he has \nnot been properly investigated for it; \n \n2. There is no record of the key Special Branch intelligence in \nrelation to this murder.  \n \n3. In relation to the meeting on 19 January 1993 between Detective \nConstable A, the Special Branch handlers and Informant 1 there \nare four different accounts: \n \n• Detective Constable C said that there was no admission \nmade and no intelligence provided by Informant 1 in relation \nto the murder; \n• Detective Sergeant E stated that there was no admission \nmade, but that Informant 1 provided intelligence as to who \nmay have committed the murder. This intelligence cannot be \nfound; \n• Detective Constable A said that he had no recollection of the \nmeeting; \n• Detective Sergeant M claimed that Detective Constable A \ntold him that informant 1 had admitted the murder during this \nmeeting. \n \n4. There is no record of Informant 1 ever providing any intelligence \nabout who killed Sharon McKenna; \n \n \n72 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n5. On 18 January 1993 police are alleged to have known that \nInformant 1 was a suspect. They met with him three times after \nthat, without arresting him.    \n \n6. None of these meetings were officially documented; \n \n7. Both Detective Sergeant M and Detective Constable A have \nconfirmed during their interviews under caution that Informant 1 \nhad admitted to being the second gunman. No proper action was \ntaken in respect of this disclosure; \n \n8. The journals of Detective Sergeant M and Detective Sergeant E \nconfirm these undocumented meetings with Informant 1; \n \n9. Detective Sergeant E’s journal confirms that there was a meeting \nbetween Special Branch and Detective Superintendent B, \nfollowing the undocumented meet with Informant 1 on 19 January \n1993; \n \n10. During the meeting between Special Branch and Detective \nSuperintendent B it was alleged that Informant 1 was the backup \ngunman for the murder. No proper action was taken in respect of \nthis allegation; \n \n11. Of the 37 criminal interviews of informant 1, 19 were carried out \nby his own CID handler, Detective Constable A.  Detective \nSergeant GG, who sat in on these interviews felt he was “just \ngoing through the motions.” Detective Sergeant GG knew that \nInformant 1 was Detective Constable A’s informant and believed \nthat he was not going to say anything of importance about the \nmurder. These interviews were a sham. \n \n \n73 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n12. The interview notes provided by the  police do not indicate that \nDetective Constable A challenged Informant 1 about his \nadmission to Detective Constable A that he had been involved in \nthe murder of Ms McKenna; \n \n13. Detective Sergeant GG has said that he knew that Informant 1 \nwould say nothing during the interview, because he was not one \nof his handlers. Therefore the interview was not purposeful for the \ncriminal investigation;  \n    \n14. Special Branch increased their monthly payment to Informant 1 \nfrom £100 a week to £160 a week, in the weeks after the murder, \ndespite the fact Informant 1 was a main suspect for this unsolved \nmurder. Detective Sergeant E states that this was because of the \nintelligence provided by Informant 1 about the murder of Sharon \nMcKenna. There is no intelligence provided by Informant 1 which \njustifies this increase; \n \n15. No one has been charged with the murder of Sharon McKenna; \n \n16. There is no record of a review of the continued employment of \nInformant 1 as an informant following the murder; \n \n17. The facts outlined above have had the effect of protecting \nInformant 1 from possible prosecution for the murder of Sharon \nMcKenna.  This is collusion.    \n \n \n \n \n74 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDER OF MR SEAN \nMcPARLAND \n \n14.1 Mr Sean McParland was from Derriaghy, South Belfast. He died on 25 \nFebruary 1994. He had been babysitting four grandchildren at his \ndaughter’s house on 17 February in Skegoniel when two gunmen \nentered the house and he was shot and wounded in the neck. Two \nweapons were used in this attack. He died in hospital from his injuries.  \nThe Red Hand Commando claimed responsibility but police did not \naccept this, and have attributed the murder to the UVF.  \n \n14.2 An investigation ensued and at least four people were identified as \nresponsible for the murder. An informant had provided intelligence the \nday before the murder that someone was going to be killed in the area. \nPolice had mounted a response during which Informant 1 was seen in \nthe area. The informant stated Informant I had been involved in the \naborted attempt the day before the murder, and that the operation had \nbeen called off for the time being. \n \n14.3 An informant provided intelligence the day after the shooting that the \nUVF were responsible. He named those who were allegedly involved.  \n \n14.4 Informant 1 also provided intelligence, on 19 February 1994, stating \nthat the UVF were responsible and that named persons, including \nanother informant, were involved. He also named himself as having \nhad some role around this murder, although it did not specify what his \nrole was.  Four people, including Informant 1, were arrested for this \nmurder on 21 February 1994. \n \n \n75 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n14.5 Three other individuals were circulated as “Arrest on Sight” on 21 \nFebruary 1994. This was subsequently cancelled, \n \n  “ due to accommodation and manpower shortages” \n \n14.6 The arrests were to be re-scheduled but this did not happen.  \n \n14.7 An Application for Extension of Detention was made for all four \nsuspects on 22 February 1994. It stated that all four men were believed \nto have been responsible for the attack. The intelligence on which it \nwas based cannot be found.  \n \n14.8 Informant 1 and two others were released without charge.  \n \n14.9 On 5 January 1994 during a search, prior to the murder, a piece of \npaper was found which had details of the owner of the house at which \nMr McParland was shot. The person in whose custody this document \nwas found was arrested after the attack and pleaded guilty to the \ncharge of possession of information of use to terrorists. He was \nconvicted. \n \n14.10 Following this murder Informant 1 and another informant were \nappointed to more senior positions within the North Belfast/ \nNewtownabbey UVF. \n \n14.11 Subsequently an informant was named as the gunman who killed Sean \nMcParland.  \n \n14.12 The police did not provide the intelligence provided by Informant 1 in \nresponse to a request by the Police Ombudsman. In October 2004 \npolice at Castlereagh Police Station found an abandoned cabinet. They \ndiscovered that it contained material which appeared to relate to \n \n76 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nDetective Sergeant M and Detective Constable A. They informed the \nPolice Ombudsman who took possession of the cabinet. Among the \ndocumentation discovered was the intelligence document which stated \nthe information in paragraph 14.4.  \n \n14.13 No action was taken to review the ongoing employment or to cancel \nany informant status as a consequence of this murder. It is not possible \nto prove conclusively that the police officers responsible had seen this \nintelligence, provided by Informant 1. The Special Branch Detective \nChief Superintendent L, who would have been responsible for such a \nreview, has refused to co-operate with this enquiry.  \n \nFindings of The Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Murder \nof Sean McParland \n \n14.14 Informant 1 was involved in a conspiracy to murder on 16 February \n1994. He did not tell his handlers about this. The attack was aborted as \na consequence of information supplied by another informant. \n \n14.15 Police arrested Informant 1, and others. They made the application for \nextension of   detention. There is no intelligence available upon which \nthese applications were based. The absence of the relevant \nintelligence is indicative of a pattern of similar behaviour to that \nidentified in the previous paragraphs. They were all released without \ncharge.  \n \n14.16 Police did not arrest the other individuals despite the intelligence which \nthey held about their alleged responsibility for the murder. \n \n14.17 Police continued to employ Informant 1 and another informant without \nany consideration of all the information which was available to them. \nThis is indicative of collusion.  \n \n77 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDERS OF MR GARY \nCONVIE AND MR EAMON FOX \n \n15.1 Seven days before the murders of Mr Gary Convie and Mr Eamon Fox, \nan informant told police that he had two guns, of the type used for the \nsubsequent murders, and other weapons under his control. The \nevening before the murder police sighted Man S and another man at \nthe junction of Shore Road and Skegoneil Avenue. \n \n15.2 At approximately 13.25 on 18 May 1994 Mr Gary Convie and Mr \nEamon Fox were shot dead whilst eating their lunch in a blue \nVolkswagen Polo, parked close to a building site in North Queen Street \nin Tigers Bay. A third person received lesser injuries.  \n \n15.3 Clothing and the murder weapon were subsequently recovered at a \nderelict house, following information received. Man S was one of those \narrested. He admitted having the gun prior to the murders and then \ntaking the gun and clothing and storing it afterwards.  \n \n15.4 Police documentation indicates that the day before the murders Man S \nwas picked up in a car by a man he knew and that this man gave him \nthe gun used in the murders. Man S was convicted.  \n \n15.5 Informant 1, and others, including another informant, were arrested on \nthe day of the murders. An informant was suspected of scouting the \nmurders as he was in the area driving around at the time. He was also \nspotted by police with Informant 1 in Informant 1’s car before the \nmurders. Informant 1’s custody record notes that he asked for and was \nsupplied with a razor after his arrest. His custody photograph was \n \n78 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \ntaken the day after the murder by which time he had shaved off his \ngoatee beard.  \n \n15.6 The gunman for these murders was reported by witnesses to have a \ngoatee beard. It has been noted by the Police Ombudsman’s \nInvestigators that it is recorded that, at interview, Informant 1 was \nasked why he had shaved off his goatee beard.   \n \n15.7 There is no record of any consideration by police of carrying out any \nidentification process, despite the fact that there were witnesses to the \nmurders who described the gunman in varying degrees. \n \n15.8 Further detailed intelligence was subsequently received by police in \nrelation to the murder  \n \n15.9 Some documents relating to this murder were recovered during Police \nOmbudsman searches of material at Greencastle Police station. \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Murders \nof Gary Convie and Eamon Fox \n \n15.10 Informant 1 was arrested and released in relation to these murders. He \nremoved his beard whilst in police custody, and there was no attempt \nto carry out any identification process at that time, despite the fact that \nthere was witness evidence which stated that the gunman had a \ngoatee beard.  \n \n15.11 In the absence of a satisfactory explanation for this sequence of \nevents: \n \n• The arrest and subsequent release of Informant 1 without any \nattempt to carry out an identification process,  \n \n79 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Failure to take further action in relation to the weapons under the \ncontrol of informants; \n• The absence of any participating informant status in respect of \nother matters identified during this investigation, and  \n• The continuing employment of an informant without consideration of \nall these matters; \n is indicative of collusion.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n80 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDER OF MR GERALD \nBRADY AND ASSOCIATED \nINCIDENTS \n \n16.1 Mr Gerald Brady was a taxi driver who picked up two men in Antrim \ntown centre on 17 June 1994 and took the men to Carrickfergus. He \nwas shot three times and died of his injuries. \n \n16.2 Almost three years later an informant stated that three individuals were \ninvolved in this murder, including Informant 1 and others. He gave \nfurther details about the murder. Informant 1 has never been arrested \nfor the murder of Gerald Brady. \n \n16.3 Ballistic tests in 1997 showed that the gun used to murder Gerald \nBrady was also used in a “punishment” shooting two weeks later \n(which was linked to the same UVF unit), to two later UVF \n“punishment” shootings (associated with North Belfast and \nNewtownabbey UVF) and to more than ten other shooting incidents . \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Murder of \nGerald Brady and the Associated Cases. \n \n16.4 Police had access to intelligence implicating three individuals, including \nInformant 1 and another informant, in the murder of Gerald Brady. \nThey also had forensic evidence that the gun used to shoot Gerald \nBrady was available to the UVF. Informant 1 had informed police a few \nmonths after the murder that he was in possession of a handgun of the \nsame type. There is no record of him being given participating \ninformant status to have the weapon, or of any action taken by police to \nrecover the weapon.  \n \n81 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n16.5 The Police Ombudsman has considered the continued employment of \nthe two informants, the fact that police failed to act properly following \nthe receipt of the information relating to the murders of Mr Convie and \nMr Fox, the matters described above in relation to the murder of Mr \nBrady, the matters described in relation to the “punishment” shooting \nwhich followed it and the two shootings three years later. This is \nindicative of a pattern of collusive action.   \n \n16.6 There was no linkage by CID, followed by investigation of these \nincidents, despite the fact that there could have been.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n82 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDER OF MR THOMAS \nSHEPPARD \n \n17.1 Mr Thomas Sheppard lived in Coleraine. He was shot in front of a \nnumber of customers in the Towers Tavern in Balee Estate in \nBallymena on 21 March 1996. \n \n17.2 Subsequently an informant gave details of who carried out the murder. \nInformant 1 was named as participating in the murder. \n \n17.3 Intelligence from another source stated that Informant 1 had been in a \npub recently, “spouting about” having shot Thomas Sheppard the year \nbefore, and gave further information about the murder.  \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Murder of \nMr Thomas Sheppard. \n \n17.4 Police Ombudsman enquiries into the murder of Mr Sheppard have \nfound no mention of Informant 1 as a possible suspect for this murder. \nThere is no record of the above intelligence in the investigation file, or \nof any action taken in respect of it, by the team investigating the \nSheppard murder. \n \n17.5 There is no record of any review of the continued employment of \nInformant 1 following the receipt of this intelligence. \n \n83 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nTHE INVESTIGATION OF THE \nMURDER OF MR JOHN \nHARBINSON \n \n18.1 In the early hours of Sunday 18 May 1997, Mr Harbinson was found \nmurdered in an alleyway in the Mount Vernon estate. The attack which \nled to his death had been allegedly sanctioned by a senior member of \nthe UVF in this area. \n  \n18.2 Informant 1 and his associates became the main suspects for this \nmurder within hours of the murder. A significant amount of high grade \nintelligence was received by both CID and Special Branch on 18 and \n19 May 1997 \n \n18.3 Detective Sergeant E telephoned Informant 1 after the murder, and \nwas told by a person in the house that he was drunk and in bed.  \n \n18.4 Informant 1’s house was searched, as were the houses of many of his \nassociates. He was eventually arrested on 25 May 1997, after an \nofficer spotted him coming out of a local bar. He was released without \ncharge on 26 May 1997. \n \n18.5 In the days immediately after the murder of Mr Harbinson, Special \nBranch had received information from an informant. Special Branch \nhave provided no contemporaneous written record of the information \nreceived which, apart from naming those responsible, also indicated \nthat: \n \n• an informant had witnessed the murder and  \n \n84 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n• had run away with the murderers to Ballyhalbert.  \n \nThis information was never documented. The Murder Investigation \nTeam did not receive it. The Police Ombudsman found it in the journal \nof an officer who had been making enquiries on another matter and \nhad noted it. This officer identified that the names had been received \nby the murder investigation team at the time, but did not realise the \nsignificance of the reference to Ballyhalbert.  \n \n18.6 Had this information been shared with CID, a search and arrest \noperation could have obtained vital forensic evidence which may have \nlinked the suspects to the murder of Mr Harbinson. As it was the CID \nteams properly searched empty houses in Belfast, but could not arrest \nthe suspects until days afterwards, when any opportunities for the \nrecovery of forensic evidence deriving from their involvement had been \nlost. \n \n18.7 Having identified the existence of the information about Ballyhalbert, \nthe Police Ombudsman conducted enquiries to establish if there was \nany trace of the murder suspects going to Ballyhalbert in May 1997. \nThere is no direct evidential link between the suspects for the murder \nand this information.  \n \n18.8 The enquiries made included: \n \n• A search of local police records and liaison with local officers \nand collators;  \n   \n• Searches of other agencies systems; \n \n \n85 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• The identification of all public telephone call boxes and \nanalysis of billing; \n \n• The identification of caravan sites;  \n \n• The identification of CCTV routes into and out of \nBallyhalbert; \n \n• The identification of ATMs; \n \n• Limited financial enquiries; \n \n• Telephone billing enquiries; \n \n• Computer searches on Ballyhalbert. \n \n \n18.9 The Police Ombudsman has established that there was a phone-call \nfrom a caravan park in Ballyhalbert to the Police Exchange at 1501 hrs \non Monday 19 May. Detective Constable S began duty at 15.00 hours \nthat day. The Police Ombudsman’s investigators have established that \nthere are no records at the local station of any incidents in Ballyhalbert \nto which police were called at that time.  \n \nInterview of Police Officers by Police Ombudsman’s \nInvestigators \n \n18.10 The Police Ombudsman has interviewed a number of Special Branch \ninformant handlers including Detective Constable P, Detective \nConstable T and Detective Sergeant E about the handling of the \nintelligence that an informant had seen the murder and had run away \nwith the murderers and in particular about the dissemination of the \n \n86 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \ninformation. At interview these officers deny knowing anything about \nthe information which stated that the murderers had gone to a named \nlocation or about why Mr Harbinson was murdered: \n \n• Detective Constable T said that his understanding was that an \ninformant  had heard a commotion, and saw the attackers beating \nMr Harbinson to death, and that the informant  had “panicked”, and \nhad run away with the murderers.  \n \n• Other officers, including Detective Constable P who received the \ninformation, denied that the informant had named the location. He \nsaid that he had relayed the message verbally to Detective \nSergeant E, who said he would take care of it.  \n \n18.11 Detective Sergeant  E has said that he passed the information onto \nCID as to who was responsible for the murder but denied knowing \nanything about Ballyhalbert.  \n \n18.12 Detective Constable T said on 11 September 1997, four months after \nthe murder, Detective Sergeant E and Detective Inspector Q told him \nthat information from the informant was missing from the system, and \nthat Detective Sergeant E then dictated to him the wording of the \ndocument. The document submitted did not contain any reference to \nBallyhalbert, even at that stage. \n \n18.13 Detective Sergeant E denies any involvement in preparing this \ndocument. \n \n18.14 Police Ombudsman investigators sought to re-interview the officers: \n \n \n87 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Detective Constable T refused to be re-interviewed, on medical \ngrounds. There were insufficient grounds to arrest Detective \nConstable T.  \n \n• On re-interview Detective Constable P denied covering up the \nlocation to which the murderers had allegedly fled. \n \n• Detective Sergeant E refused to be re-interviewed. He described \nthe failure to record any of the information in May 1997 as an \n“administrative error”. \n \n18.15 The senior CID detectives in charge of the Harbinson murder \ninvestigation were interviewed, as was the officer who reviewed the \nmurder investigation in 1999. They state that they were aware there \nwas intelligence naming the people allegedly involved. However, no \nCID officer, at any level, was told that two of the suspects were \ninformants at the time of the murder, nor were they told that an \ninformant had provided witness information about the murder. No CID \nofficer was told that the suspects were at Ballyhalbert following the \nmurder. The senior CID officers state that if they had known the \nlocation of the suspects, they would have arrested them. \n \n18.16 Junior CID officers who were involved in the murder investigation were \ninterviewed. Many of these officers recall little detail of the murder \nitself, or they had only a short-term role in the investigation.  However, \nit is clear that Informant 1 and his associates were always the main \nsuspects for the murder.  An Officer refers to “locker room talk” within \nCID that Informant 1 was a “protected species”, but the Detective \nConstable does not provide any specific examples of Special Branch \nprotecting Informant 1. \n \n \n88 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n18.17 The Police Ombudsman has considered the option of interviewing the \ninformant, to find out what he told his handlers concerning the murder \nof Mr Harbinson. This option was ruled out, as he is himself a prime \nsuspect for the murder.  \n \n18.18 Of the main suspects for the Mr Harbinson murder, two were police \ninformants at the time. These individuals were also the most senior \nUVF figures in the group who allegedly murdered Mr Harbinson, and \nSpecial Branch already had a wealth of information implicating them in \n“punishment” shootings, beatings, and murders over previous years. \nThey continued to be employed as informants. \n \n18.19 The continued employment of the informant was the subject of \nquestions by the Police Ombudsman’s investigators. Detective \nSuperintendent K, said that this decision would have been made with \nthe approval of the Regional Head of Special Branch, taking into \naccount the ongoing need for intelligence from the UVF, despite the \nfact that he was of the opinion that Informant 1 was probably \nresponsible for the Harbinson murder. The Regional Head of Special \nBranch for this period, Detective Chief Superintendent R, has declined \nto co-operate with this enquiry. The senior Special Branch officer also \nstated that Special Branch would have informed senior CID officers of \nsensitive issues around this murder investigation, such as the fact that \ntwo of the murder suspects were Special Branch informants. The CID \nofficers deny this and there is no record of it. \n \n \nOther Investigative Failures \n  \n18.20 Police Ombudsman investigators tried to obtain the CID Policy Book for \nthe Harbinson murder investigation, to establish what decisions CID \ntook in relation to this case. However, PSNI has told the Police \n \n89 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nOmbudsman that this Policy Book has gone missing and cannot be \nfound.  \n \n18.21 Tape-lifts which had been created were returned to the police in \nSeptember 1997 with no record of any forensic work having been \ncarried out on them. Police did not ask FSNI to check the body bag in \nwhich Mr Harbinson was removed, for forensic evidence. Most of the \nexhibits, including the clothes Mr Harbinson was wearing, and the \nhandcuffs he was found in, were destroyed on 22 October 1997, as \nthey were deemed to be a “health hazard”. The clothing of the murder \nsuspects was returned to them shortly afterwards.  \n \n18.22 A glove and two metal bars were photographed near the location at \nwhich the body was found. There is no record of them in the Exhibit \nBook or of them being submitted for analysis and they cannot now be \nfound. \n \n18.23 Two of the main suspects identified in relation to the murder of Mr \nHarbinson were never arrested. \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the \nInvestigation of the Murder of John Harbinson \n \n18.24 Had the information about Ballyhalbert been shared with CID, an arrest \nand search operation could have obtained vital evidence, which may \nhave linked the suspects to the murder. CID could not arrest the \nsuspects until days afterwards when any forensic opportunities had \nbeen lost. \n \n \n90 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n18.25 The Police Ombudsman is totally unconvinced that the informant, as an \ninnocent witness to the murder decided to run away with the \nmurderers. \n \n18.26 The Police Ombudsman considers that in relation to the murder of \nJohn Harbinson, Special Branch did not deal properly with information \nabout the wrongful acts of their agents, and that Special Branch \ncolluded with the murderers of Mr Harbinson, by concealing information \nreceived following the murder, and by continuing to employ the two \ninformants after the murder. \n \n18.27 Given the serious failings in the original investigation and the \ndestruction and loss of exhibits, there appears little chance of any \nsuccessful re-investigation, unless all potential witness evidence is fully \nexploited. \n \n18.28 The suppression of the information about the location of the suspects is \nanother example of Special Branch officers mishandling information in \nthe first instance and suppressing vital information, which had the \neffect of protecting Informant 1 and other informants from possible \nprosecution.  \n \n \n91 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nTHE MURDER OF MR THOMAS \nENGLISH \n \n19.1 On 31 October 2000 four men in balaclavas burst into Thomas \nEnglish’s house and shot him dead in front of his wife.  \n \n19.2 Intelligence about Mr English’s murder named informant 1 and three of \nhis associates. Informant 1 and his associates were arrested on 8 \nNovember 2000, but they provided alibis for each other, saying that \nthey were setting off fireworks for Halloween at the time of the murder. \nInformant 1’s house and car were searched.  \n \n19.3 No one has been charged with Mr English’s murder.  \n \n \nFinding of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Murder of \nMr Thomas English \n \n19.4 Informant 1’s alleged involvement in this murder adds to the existing \nintelligence picture of Informant 1’s alleged involvement in murder. \n \n19.5 Subsequent Special Branch written assessments of Informant 1 make \nno mention of his alleged involvement in this murder.  Instead they \nstate, in relation to Informant 1: \n \n“As far as can be ascertained the CHIS is not currently involved in \ncriminality” \n \n \n \n92 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nATTEMPTED MURDERS SIX \nAND SEVEN IN 1992 AND 1997 \n \n20.1 In 1992 Victim Six grappled with an attacker who tried to shoot him at a \nspecific location. At the time, he provided police with a description of \nhis attacker and a photo-fit montage, which resembled Informant 1. \nInformant 1 was not arrested at the time. From Police Ombudsman \nenquiries it is clear that Informant 1 is a potential suspect for this \nattempted murder in 1992.  \n \n20.2 In April 1997 an Informant told his CID handlers that Victim Six was a \nprospective UVF murder target. On 07 May 1997 Informant 1’s close \nassociates were arrested for placing a bomb under Victim Six’s car.  \n \n20.3 Informant 1 was not arrested for this second murder attempt, although \nbriefing notes viewed at Forensic Science Northern Ireland state he \nwas in the area at the time.  \n \n20.4 The intended victim has now made a complaint to the Police \nOmbudsman alleging that the police investigation into these \nmurder attempts were “stymied” in order to protect police \ninformants. The Police Ombudsman cannot, therefore, comment \nfurther on this matter at the present time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n93 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nATTEMPTED MURDER EIGHT \n \n21.1 In 1993, Informant 1 provided information that led to a successful \npolice operation, preventing the murder of Intended Victim Eight and \nleading to the arrest and conviction of one of Informant 1’s associates. \n \n21.2 His information led to police stopping this man in possession of a \nloaded shotgun as he was on his way to his intended victim. \n \n21.3 Informant 1 was also arrested for the attempted murder. The Police \nOmbudsman has uncovered documentation indicating that the arrest \nwas made so that he would not come under suspicion as a police \ninformant. Informant 1 was remanded in prison for a number of months, \napparently at his own request, to ensure he was not identified as the \nsource behind this police operation.  \n \n21.4 The perpetrator was convicted and served a number of years in prison \nfor this offence.  \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Attempted \nMurder Eight \n \n21.5 Informant 1 provided good information in dangerous circumstances, \nwhich foiled the murder. His information led police to arrest a \nsuspected UVF terrorist however there remains a question as to police \ncompliance with the rules in relation to allowing Informant 1 to act this \nway and whether police disclosed to the Director of Public \nProsecutions that an informant had been involved in this murder \nattempt. \n \n \n94 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n21.6 There is no record of any participating informant status having been \ngranted to Informant 1 in relation to this incident. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n95 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nATTEMPTED MURDER NINE \n \n22.1 Police Ombudsman investigators  have seen police documentation in \nrelation to a failed murder attack on a man in 2002. The intended victim \nsurvived and identified Informant 1 as one of his attackers. \n \n22.2 There is also other extensive intelligence held within the policing \nsystem which identifies Informant 1 as having been involved in this \nincident. He was arrested days after the attack but subsequently \nreleased without charge. \n \n22.3 This matter was subsequently dealt with by the police. \n \n \nFinding of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Attempted \nMurder Nine \n \n22.4 In the subsequent authorisation for the continued employment of \nInformant I this matter is not mentioned. \n \n22.5 A misleading and inaccurate confidential document was prepared for \nsubmission to the Director of Public Prosecutions which failed to \nmention that Informant 1 was suspected of involvement in numerous \nmurders and other serious criminality.  \n \n22.6 Both these documents were therefore misleading. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n96 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nATTEMPTED MURDER OF \nINTENDED VICTIM TEN \n  \n22.7 Detailed information was given to police that Informant 1 and another \nmale were planning an attack on an unknown male. They were \nallegedly in possession of two weapons and aborted the attempt when \na gun jammed. The weapons were later recovered and other members \nof the UVF arranged for a vulnerable person to accept responsibility for \nthe weapons.   \n \n22.8 Informant 1 was not arrested or questioned about this matter. \n \n \n97 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION FOUR \n    \nINTELLIGENCE LINKING \nINFORMANT 1 AND OTHERS \nTO OTHER CRIMES \n \nCID SEARCHES BLOCKED BY SPECIAL BRANCH \n \n23.1 In 1997 detailed information was received by CID about the location of \nweapons, ammunition and explosives and also a list of intended \nmurder targets for the UVF. \n \n23.2 It was alleged Informant 1 kept guns in two locations. Informant 1 had \nhimself previously provided information to his handlers that he had \nthree handguns, one of which was at his own home.  The information \nalso indicated the location of a large UVF arms hide at which there \nwere a number of weapons. A number of other locations were identified \nat which UVF weapons were stored. \n \n23.3 CID planned a number of searches of UVF-linked properties in North \nBelfast. The aim was to frustrate the UVF by seizing a large quantity of \ntheir munitions, and arresting individuals in possession of them. \n \n23.4 In order to carry out these searches, CID had to obtain clearance from \nSpecial Branch, in case they impacted on any ongoing Special Branch \noperations.  \n \n23.5 Special Branch approved the searches of a number of addresses and \nlocations. Special Branch however refused clearance for CID to search \n \n98 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nfour locations including the two locations used by Informant 1, and the \nalleged site of the UVF arms hide. \n \n23.6 The searches of the other properties went ahead, resulting in the \nrecovery of some munitions, but they did not significantly undermine \nthe UVF. \n \nCID OFFICERS HIDE ARMS ON THE M2 MOTORWAY \nAND THEN HELP COLLEAGUES TO FIND THEM \n \n23.7 The Police Ombudsman also has concerns about the alleged actions of \nDetective Sergeant M and Detective Constable A in relation to this \nmatter. Detective Sergeant M’s memoir-style accounts, which he \nprovided to the Police Ombudsman, state that he wanted to ensure that \nthe Informant did not change his mind about the searches and remove \nweaponry, so that police could not find it \n \n23.8 Detective Sergeant M said he and Detective Constable A took some of \nthese munitions from a location and stored them in the boot of an \nAssistant Chief Constable’s car, without that officer’s knowledge. He \nwrites that the Assistant Chief Constable’s car was later driven out of \nCastlereagh police station, and that the driver did not know that he had \nmunitions stored in the boot.  The car was returned to Castlereagh \nPolice Station without anyone discovering the munitions. \n \n23.9 Detective Sergeant M writes that he then went out to the M2 motorway \nand stored the munitions in a hide by the side of the road. Detective \nSergeant M writes that he later came back to this site with the police \nsearch teams, and directed them to where the weapons were hidden, \nas though it was the UVF who had put them there. \n \n \n99 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n23.10 Special Branch officers have not been able to provide any reason why \nthey refused to grant clearance for the searches of the locations \nreferred to in this section. The two senior CID officers involved in the \nsearches have now retired and have declined to co-operate with this \nenquiry. \n \n23.11 CID Detective Inspector MM who authorised the searches has provided \na witness statement to the Police Ombudsman stating that he vaguely \nrecalls Special Branch did not provide clearance for an address to be \nsearched. He states he cannot recall which address this was, but that if \nSpecial Branch refused clearance, this would be taken to be on the \ngrounds of National Security and CID would not question it. The Police \nOmbudsman has found no evidence of any ongoing Special Branch \noperation which would have been compromised by the searches.  \n \n23.12 Within six weeks of Special Branch refusing clearance for some of the \nsearches, Informant 1 and his close associates were implicated in the \nmurder of John Harbinson and an attempted murder, as well as other \nterrorist crimes. \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Blocked \nSearches  \n \n23.13 By blocking the searches of the locations relating to Informant 1 and an \nalleged UVF arms dump, Special Branch shielded Informant 1 from \npossible arrest and prosecution, and protected his position of authority \nwithin the UVF.  This is collusion. \n \n23.14 The absence of records in Special Branch in relation to the blocking of \nthe searches is indicative of a pattern replicated throughout this report.  \nThis is also collusion. \n \n100 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nPLANNED ATTACK IN THE \nREPUBLIC OF IRELAND \n \nDublin \n \n24.1 In October 1996, Informant 1 provided information to his Special \nBranch handlers that the UVF were planning bomb attacks in Dublin in \nretaliation for any further IRA bombings.  A subsequent entry on a \nSpecial Branch officer’s private document notes that Informant 1 claims \nto have managed to convince the UVF hierarchy to abandon plans to \nbomb the Sinn Fein offices in Dublin by saying there was a heavy \nGarda presence when they were targeting the premises. This does not \nappear in any intelligence report or on Informant 1’s source file, nor \nwas this issue brought to the attention of the Police Ombudsman by the \npolice. \n \n24.2 In February 1997 Informant 1 provided information which stated that \nthe UVF in Belfast had received a supply of commercial explosives and \nstated that the UVF had been given the “green light” to carry out an \noperation on a suitable high-profile Republican target. \n \n24.3 Detective Sergeant E received this information. His police journal entry \nfor that day notes that he met Detective Superintendent K and they \nliaised with colleagues about the explosives. \n \n24.4 Police Ombudsman investigators found two personal documents \napparently prepared by Detective Sergeant E to show Informant 1’s \nvalue as a source. \n \n24.5 Among the information stored was a statement that the UVF intended \nto bomb Provisional Sinn Fein Offices in Dublin in 1996. On 20 \n \n101 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nFebruary 1997 the informant provided explosives which were made \nsafe by police and returned to the informant. \n \n \nAttack in Monaghan \n \n24.6 On Monday morning, 3 March 1997, a device partially exploded near \nthe Sinn Fein offices in Monaghan. The detonator was the only part of \nthe device which exploded.  \n \n24.7 On that date Informant 1 told his handlers that a bomb had been \ndeployed to the Sinn Fein offices in Monaghan.  Detective Sergeant E’s \n“Successes” document, which was not an official record, states that \n“The explosives used were the [made safe] explosives returned to the \nUVF” \n \n24.8 Despite numerous requests by the Police Ombudsman, the PSNI have \nnot supplied any documentation recording the receipt of these \nexplosives. Nor is there any record of Informant 1 telling police what he \ndid next with them, where he put them or who he gave them to.  There \nis no record of any pro-active operation in relation to the matter. There \nis no record of any attempt to investigate or arrest anyone for the \nmatter.  The only official record that Informant 1 provided explosives, \nwas created to give him a reward payment. \n \n24.9 Some weeks after the attack information was received naming those \ninvolved in the attack, and giving details about it.   \n \n24.10 The only official records, apart from the reward application, which show \nthe explosives were used in Monaghan is in a confidential document \nprepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions for Informant 1s arrest \non another matter.  It records that he thwarted ‘a bombing campaign in \n \n102 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nthe Republic of Ireland’ on 25 November 1996 and that he thwarted ‘a \nbomb attack in Monaghan’ on 3 March 1997.  The document does not \nmention that Informant 1 had a role in the attack and that the \nexplosives were returned to him by police. \n \n24.11 There is no evidence that Special Branch informed the Garda Siochana \nat any stage of this bombing attempt, or of who was behind it. The \nGarda Commissioner has confirmed to the Police Ombudsman that \nSpecial Branch did not provide them with any intelligence about this \nincident. The Police Ombudsman wrote to the Chief Constable asking \nhim to pass on this intelligence.  \n \nPolice Ombudsman Interviews  \n \n24.12 Police Ombudsman investigators have interviewed a number of officers \nabout this matter. Detective Sergeant E was interviewed under caution.  \nHe stated that he was involved in the hand over of the explosives and \nthe return of the made safe explosives to Informant 1. He stated that he \nhad no prior knowledge of the Monaghan attack. He said his role was \nsimply to collect the explosives and return them to Informant 1. He said \nthat he was under instructions not to make any written record. He said \nthat it was all to be done verbally as Special Branch did not want any \nwritten records until they were sure it was going to take place. \n \n24.13 Detective Constable C, who was involved in the handover of \nexplosives, said he did not know they were used in Monaghan. \n \n24.14 Detective Inspector F was the overall officer in charge ‘on the ground’ \nfor the handover of the made safe explosives.  He confirmed that the \nRegional Head of Special Branch and other senior police officers would \nhave approved the handover. He said he believed the fact the \nexplosives were made safe meant that they were no longer a risk to \n \n103 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nlife, and police would not generally have tracked what happened to \nthem subsequently.  \n \n24.15 The Police Ombudsman also interviewed Detective Superintendent K \nwho was the overall officer in control of the division in which the matter \nwas developing. He said he did not recall this specific incident. \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Monaghan \nAttack \n \n24.16 As a consequence of Informant 1’s involvement in the supply of the \nexplosives to his handlers, the potential for loss of life may have been \ndiminished. However the Police Ombudsman has real concerns about \nthe effectiveness of the RUC intervention: \n \n• No records have been found by police in relation to this matter, \ndespite an intensive search by police senior management;  \n \n• An instruction was allegedly issued at the time of the incident that \nno notes should be completed in respect of the incident; \n \n• Two informants were involved in this activity. No participating \ninformant status was considered;  \n \n• No attempt was made to conduct a pro-active operation to disrupt \nor arrest those who may have sought to use the explosive \nmaterial which Informant 1 had supplied to the police; \n \n• There was no sharing of intelligence in relation to this matter with \nAn Garda Siochana either before or after the Monaghan \nexplosion, and therefore no complementary action could be taken; \n \n \n104 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• No attempts were made to arrest those involved in the attack \ndespite the fact that police were in possession of information \nidentifying those allegedly responsible; \n \n• The suppression of intelligence that Informant 1 had been in \npossession of explosives, whom he received them from and who \nhe gave them to meant that any subsequent investigation into the \nattack would be inherently flawed.  This failing protected \nInformant 1 from investigation and possible prosecution. \n \n \n24.17 The Police Ombudsman only established the operational activity in \nrelation to the made safe explosives when a Special Branch officer’s \nrecords were examined. This information should have been officially \nrecorded. \n \n24.18 The only official records which show the made safe explosives were \nused in Monaghan are in a confidential document prepared for the \nDirector of Public Prosecutions. \n \n24.19 In the course of this investigation it has been established that Special \nBranch suppressed intelligence which they received from Informant 1, \nfailed to keep records and failed to deal with informants who had \nallegedly been involved in the planting of a bomb in Monaghan. \n \n24.20 The Police Ombudsman considers these events to be an example of \npolice collusion. \n  \n \n \n105 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nINFORMANT 1 LINKED TO \nTARGETING A REPUBLICAN \n \n25.1 Police Ombudsman investigators have uncovered details that \nInformant 1 was involved in targeting a man in North Belfast. This \nmaterial was uncovered when they were searching police computer \nsystems and had not been disclosed to the Police Ombudsman by the \nPSNI. \n \n25.2 In July 1994, an informant told police that the UVF were planning a hit \non a “Republican target” in the Antrim area, and that a white Mercedes \nwas to be used in this attack. He said that he was to meet with \nInformant 1 and others at a named place that day. \n \n25.3 An operation was mounted to watch what was happening, and to \nprepare for a response to any murder attempt.  The operation log, \nwhich is available, notes that three men drove away from a club. They \ndrove around North Belfast and stopped in an area, where one of the \nmen indicated a particular house. The surveillance log indicates that \nthe UVF were identifying the occupant of the house for a future attack. \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to the Targeting \nOperation \n \n25.4 Informant 1 was involved in the targeting of a person without reporting \nany of this to his handlers.  This should have been a major cause for \nconcern for police but there is no record of police challenging Informant \n1 about it or considering his continued employment as a source.  \n \n \n \n106 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nARSON AND OTHER CRIMES \nBY INFORMANTS \n \n26.1 The Police Ombudsman has seen intelligence that an informant told \npolice of an impending attack on a bar in Portadown.  The attack went \nahead and 12 people were arrested, including Informant 1. \n  \n26.2 On 19 August 1997, an informant told Special Branch about a UVF \nBrigade meeting, attended by Informant 1 and other senior UVF \nmembers. He said that 15-20 UVF members from each area were to \nmeet at 1900 hours the next evening at a named location. They would \nthen travel by car to Portadown, where they were going to attack a \nnamed bar.  On 7 January 2007 PSNI confirmed to the Police \nOmbudsman, in response to a request made on 21 September 2004, \nthat this intelligence had not been disseminated. \n \n26.3 Special Branch had also received a more general debrief from a \n“Casual Contact” on 20 August 1997, which stated that the Belfast UVF \nintended to attack LVF social haunts in Mid-Ulster.  Six potential \ntargets were listed, one of which was the bar which was subsequently \nattacked. Special Branch informed the Source Unit of this general \ninformation, and an Action Sheet was issued to other police, noting that \nthese premises could be the scene of a confrontation between the UVF \nand the LVF. \n \n26.4 On the next day, 20 August 1997, Informant 1 and some 29 of his \nassociates went into the bar at approximately 20.00 hours waving guns \nand declaring that they were Tigers Bay UVF. They then smashed up \nthe bar with baseball bats, poured petrol around it and set it on fire. \n \n \n107 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n26.5 A member of the public in the bar rang police and told them that the bar \nwas being attacked. Local police crews were informed and drove \ntowards the pub where another member of the public waved one of the \npolice crews in the direction of three UVF vehicles which were leaving \nthe scene. \n \n26.6 Police pursued the UVF, stopping two of the vehicles. Twelve people \nwere arrested, among them Informant 1. All twelve were convicted at \ncourt. Informant 1 was released in March 1999. Special Branch officers \nhave claimed at interview that Informant 1 was arrested and \nimprisoned for this attack because of Special Branch intelligence, and \nthat it was a Special Branch-led operation which resulted in these \narrests. \n \n26.7 Police Ombudsman investigators have taken a statement from the Duty \nInspector that evening. He said that when he began duty at 1600 \nhours, a Special Branch Constable briefed him there was intelligence \nthat there may be a UVF attack on either of two bars in the near future.  \n \n26.8 The Inspector was not given details of the time of a proposed attack, or \nof what individuals would be involved. The Inspector states that he \nconsiders the subsequent arrests to have been reactive on the part of \npolice, rather than proactive. The Inspector states that he was not \ngiven sufficient detail for any police operation to be mounted prior to \nthe attack. \n \n26.9 While Informant 1 was on remand for this attack, his handler Detective \nConstable C prepared a confidential document for disclosure to the \nDirector of Public Prosecutions. This report notes Informant 1’s benefits \nas an informant. It comments that one of Informant 1’s motives for \nbecoming an informant was “to prevent the murder of innocent people” \nand that Informant 1’s intelligence has “invariably led to lives being \n \n108 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nsaved”. At the time this report was written Informant 1 was a main \nsuspect for murder, and had been implicated in a number of other \nmurders from 1991 onwards. None of this is mentioned. \n \n26.10 Police Ombudsman investigators interviewed Detective Constable C in \nrelation to this.  He stated that he had not been aware at that time of \nany intelligence implicating Informant 1 in murders. This statement is \nlacking in credibility.  Special Branch had recently broken off contact \nwith Informant 1 because of his suspected involvement in the murder. \n \n26.11 Detective Superintendent K was interviewed in relation to the \nconfidential document and Informant 1’s continued employment as an \ninformant. He said Special Branch handlers had an obligation to be \nclose to their sources, and that as a result, \n \n“there can be a slight deviation on objectivity, but that’s what they’re \nrequired to do. The state require them to do that.” \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Special \nBranch Handling of Matters Relevant to the Attack on the Bar \n \n26.12 Special Branch officers were aware of the detail of the threat of an \nimpending attack. They did not inform local police about all the details \nwhich they had, nor did they arrange for a police operation, which may \nwell have had the capability to prevent the attack on the bar, and to \narrest more of those involved in the attack. Only good local police work \non the day helped apprehend those responsible. \n \n26.13 By their failure to act appropriately Special Branch allowed a situation \nto develop in which life and property were put at risk. That risk attached \naffects not only members of the public but also the uniformed officers \nwho had to respond to the call for help.  \n \n109 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n26.14 In the absence of any explanation from any of the Special Branch \nofficers involved, the Police Ombudsman has concluded that this \nsituation arose because of collusion.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n110 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nDRUG DEALING BY \nINFORMANTS \n \n27.1 The Police Ombudsman has obtained around 70 separate intelligence \nreports held by police implicating Informant 1 in 17 instances of drug-\ndealing, including two reports where he admitted to serving police \nofficers that he was involved in this criminality. Most of this intelligence \ncomes from CID and Drugs Squad and is graded as “usually reliable \nand probably true”, according to the Special Branch definition. \n \n27.2 Police documentation noted when and where Informant 1 and others \nwent to sell drugs and locations at which drugs were openly used and \nsold. \n \n27.3 The material within CID is particularly detailed. It notes places where \nInformant 1 sold drugs and those selling drugs on his behalf.  It also \nrefers to the drugs he controlled, including cannabis, ecstasy, \namphetamines and cocaine. \n \n27.4 Special Branch also received their own intelligence which linked \nInformant 1 to drug dealing: on some occasions they passed this \nintelligence to the Drugs Squad, on other occasions they did not. \n \n27.5 Throughout this period Informant 1 occasionally supplied Special \nBranch with information about other drug-dealers, including some of his \nown associates. In analysing this intelligence, it appears that his \nmotivation in supplying this information was to incriminate rival drug-\ndealers, in order to protect his own interests and maintain control over \nthe drugs trade in his area.   \n \n \n111 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nLarne \n \n27.6 Police Ombudsman investigators have recovered police intelligence \ndated July 1994 in which police stopped Informant 1’s car at a hotel in \nLarne. In the car were Informant 1 and a number of his associates. \nSpecial Branch documentation does not note if anyone was searched \nor arrested when this car was stopped. \n \n27.7 Police records show that in August 1994 Informant 1 told his handlers \nthat the North Belfast UVF had taken control of drug-dealing in the \nhotel. He stated that the UVF were allowing local dealers to sell drugs \non their behalf, and that Man O [a senior UVF figure] allowed this \npractice to continue on a trial-basis, as long as UVF members were not \ndirectly seen to be involved in drug-dealing themselves. There is no \nevidence that this information was ever passed to the Drugs Squad. In \nNovember 1994 Informant 1 was arrested, charged and convicted of \ndrugs offences.  \n \n27.8 Intelligence indicates that Informant 1 was personally involved in drug-\ndealing from 1994 onwards, and that he had effectively admitted this to \nhis handlers. \n \n27.9 In October 1994, an informant told his Special Branch handlers that \nInformant 1 and others were involved in the sale of drugs in North \nBelfast. This information was apparently passed to the Drugs Squad. \n \n27.10 In February 2001, police discovered a pipe-bomb making factory in \nflats in North Belfast. During the same search, police also discovered a \nlarge cache of ecstasy tablets.  Subsequently Informant 1 supplied \ninformation relating to the purpose of the pipe bomb factory.  \n \n \n112 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n27.11 In November 1999, Informant 1 had told Special Branch that his \nassociate, another informant, was dealing in cannabis. In February \n2002, police intelligence noted that an informant was now dealing \ncannabis for Informant 1, as Informant 1 had carried out a \n“punishment” shooting on him the previous year. The reason for the \n“punishment” shooting was that he had been buying drugs at a cheaper \nprice from the UDA, instead of from Informant 1. \n \n \nPolice Ombudsman Interviews \n \n27.12 The Police Ombudsman has interviewed a number of Special Branch \nofficers in relation to Informant 1’s apparent involvement in drug-\ndealing.  \n \n27.13 The vast majority of them have said they were unaware of any \nintelligence implicating Informant 1 in drug-dealing. They said that if \nthey had researched an individual on the CID intelligence system that \ncould have compromised the informant’s identity. \n \n27.14 The Police Ombudsman does not accept this explanation, nor does \nshe accept that the officers were ignorant of Informant 1’s drug dealing. \n \n27.15 The Police Ombudsman investigators have spoken to one Special \nBranch handler who has given an entirely different account. Detective \nConstable P was a handler for Informant 1 from 1996 to 2002.  He said \nin interview that although Special Branch did not have direct access to \nthe CID intelligence system, print-outs were forwarded to them to give \nthem a picture of general criminal intelligence in their area.  \n \n27.16 Police Ombudsman investigators have spoken to a number of Drugs \nSquad officers to establish why police did not take a more pre-emptive \n \n113 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nrole against Informant 1 in relation to his apparent drug dealing. \nInformant 1 was only prosecuted once for drugs offences when there \nwas a wealth of intelligence implicating him in drug dealing. \n \n27.17 They have said they were aware of Informant 1’s probable involvement \nin drugs, but that their limited staff resources meant that they only \ntargeted larger-scale drug dealers further up the supply chain. \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Drug Dealing \n \n27.18 Police documentation records that monies from drug operations formed \na major part of the revenues of loyalist paramilitaries during this period. \nThe failure by police to deal with this aspect of their criminality meant \nthat this source of funding continued. \n \n27.19 The Police Ombudsman considers that Special Branch deliberately \ndisregarded most of Informant 1’s involvement in drug dealing from \n1994 onwards. This is collusion. Although police have high-grade \nintelligence that their informant was involved in drug dealing, his only \nrelated conviction was for the possession of drugs. \n \n \n \n \n114 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n“PUNISHMENT” SHOOTINGS \nAND ATTACKS. \n \n28.1 Apart from matters for which Informant 1 has been charged and \nconvicted there is significant intelligence which indicates that, between \n1991 and 2002, Informant 1 and his associates are alleged to have \nbeen concerned in up to ten separate punishment shootings and at \nleast 13  punishment attacks. \n \n28.2 Informant 1 is named by the victim of one of these punishment \nshootings in 1997 as having been involved in the attack. Bullet heads \nrecovered were submitted for forensic analysis and the weapon was \nidentified as having been used in a punishment shooting two days \nearlier. \n \n28.3 Significantly the ballistic test also identified this weapon as the one \nused to murder Gerald Brady three years earlier in June 1994. \n \n28.4 The victim of the shooting in 1997, who names Informant 1, \nsubsequently withdrew his statement of complaint and the matter was \nnot proceeded with. \n \n28.5 Of the ten identified punishment shootings, on three occasions \nInformant 1 is named by others as having been directly involved in the \nincident. Of the remaining seven incidents, Informant 1 is suspected of \nhaving had some level of involvement. Of the thirteen punishment \nattacks Informant 1 is named as having direct involvement in eight of \nthe identified incidents. In the remaining five incidents Informant 1 is \nsuspected as having had some level of involvement.  \n \n \n115 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nFinding of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Punishments \n \n28.6 There is no evidence that any action was taken by police in respect \nInformant 1’s involvement in any matters referred to above.  \n \n \n \n \n \n116 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nPOSSESSION OF INFORMATION \nLIKELY TO BE OF USE TO \nTERRORISTS \n \n29.1 Following his arrest in November 2000 for the murder of Thomas \nEnglish, Informant 1’s vehicle was searched and a piece of paper was \nrecovered which had an address and a vehicle registration number on \nit.  He was subsequently charged with the offence of possession of \ninformation likely to be of use to terrorists. \n  \n29.2 In interview Informant 1 stated that someone else had given him the \ncar registration number, and that it was not in his handwriting. He \nstated that in the past he had provided details of cars acting \nsuspiciously to a police officer.  Informant 1 stated that he thought that \nhe may have asked this officer to do a check on this vehicle. \n \n29.3 The officer in question stated that at no time did informant 1 ask him to \ndo a check on that particular vehicle, nor did he do a check on that \nparticular vehicle. \n \n29.4 Informant 1 was charged with the offence but a Direction of “No \nProsecution” was issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions. \n \n29.5 Informant 1’s senior handler Detective Sergeant E prepared a \nconfidential document, to be forwarded to the Director of Public \nProsecutions in this case. In this report, Detective Sergeant E provided \na favourable account of Informant 1’s history as a source and states: \n“The recent arrest was due to unavoidable and unfortunate \ncircumstances which were not under his control. There were no sinister \nmotives behind the possession of [the] vehicle registration number…. I \nam of the opinion that the [he] will be of great value in the future and he \n \n117 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nis aware that it was unavoidable circumstances which have resulted in \nhis present circumstances.” \n \n29.6 Detective Sergeant E’s report is misleading. It does not mention that \nInformant 1 was arrested because he was a suspect for the murder of \nMr Thomas English.  \n \nFinding of the Police Ombudsman  \n \n29.7 The confidential document prepared for the court was misleading. In \nthe absence of an explanation this is indicative of collusion. \n \n118 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nSECTION FIVE \n    \nFINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS - \nINFORMANT 1 \n \n30.1 In August 2003 the Police Ombudsman asked PSNI to produce a \ndetailed schedule of all payments made to Informant 1, by way of any \nincentive, retainer, welfare or reward since his registration in May 1991. \nThis request also sought all relevant supporting documentation for any \nauthority for payment, and the method used for each payment. \n \n30.2 PSNI supplied some material in relation to this request. However some \nmaterial had never been recorded or had been destroyed.  \n \n30.3 Informant 1 was paid a regular monthly retainer and other payments \nbetween 1991 and 2003. \n \n30.4 The police management  of funds paid to informants / CHIS lacked any \nclear structure, was totally inadequate, lacked transparency and had no \naudit processes. \n \n30.5 The Police Ombudsman discovered there were many anomalies \nincluding: \n \n• The absence of clear auditable financial records prior to April \n2002;  \n \n \n119 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Discrepancies in the amounts of incentive payments which have \nmade it difficult for Police Ombudsman investigators to carry out \nan accurate conclusive audit; \n \n• Applications for payment exist only in relation to some payments \nprior to 1999. For example a payment of £10,000 was made to \nInformant 1 on one occasion. Nothing is known about why this \npayment was made, how it was paid, or who authorised it.  Nor \nis there any record of any receipt for payment. \n \n• There are discrepancies in the dates of meetings with the \ninformant, in comparison to the dates that the finance was \nauthorised for payment and believed to have been paid.  \n \n• There are only very limited records of any welfare or operational \npayments which may have been made. Informant 1 received a \nwelfare payment of £1000 for some work which he allegedly \nneeded to carry out. When asked whether the handlers had \nverified the claim made, they replied that no checks had been \ncarried out.  \n \n• It has been impossible to verify actual amounts received by the \ninformant. The Police did not have a policy requiring an \ninformant to provide a receipt. \n \n30.6 Notwithstanding these difficulties the Police Ombudsman made an \nassessment of the payments believed to have been made to Informant \n1 covering the period 1991 to 2003. This assessment was made, in \npart, on an assumption that authorised retainers were paid on a \nmonthly basis as indicated by police, except for the period when \nInformant 1 was in prison, despite the fact that some of these records \n \n120 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nwere missing. Police are only able to confirm that a total of £ 22,500 \nwas paid to Informant 1 up to and including 1998.  \n \n30.7 Police Ombudsman investigators have examined the official records \nprovided by police and the computer records retrieved in the course of \nthe investigation.  It is concluded that the figures outlined below are a \nreasonable estimate of the payments received by Informant 1. It was \nestimated the total amount authorised for payment to Informant 1 was \n£79,840. \n \nYear Retainers  Incentive  Operational Welfare \nPayments  Payments  Payments \n £ £ £ £ \nTOTAL 34140 42000 1700 2000 \n \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Financial \nArrangements \n \n \n30.8 The Police Ombudsman is most concerned that there could have \nexisted a system for the payment of informants which was so \nlacking in proper accountability mechanisms. \n \n30.9 The Police Ombudsman has seen no justification for the level of \npayments to Informant 1, whose alleged involvement in serious crime \nappears to have far exceeded any contribution which he may have \nmade.  There is also evidence to suggest that Informant 1 may have \nbeen abusing the system. On one occasion Informant 1 was paid a \nreward of several thousand pounds for information which he provided \nto Special Branch. He had provided intelligence that senior UVF \nmembers were going to target people for future attack. A car containing \na number of senior UVF people was stopped, but no guns were found \nand no arrests ensued. An application was made for a reward for \n \n121 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nInformant 1, but the application did not state that Informant 1 was one \nof the three people in the car when it was stopped. Nor did it state that \nthe other occupants of the car were also informants.    \n \n30.10 The Police Ombudsman regards the financial arrangements for the \npayment of informants as a significant failure by RUC/PSNI \nmanagement to provide a proper system of control of payments, and to \narrange for proper audit of payments made. \n \n122 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION SIX \n    \nINFORMANT HANDLING, \nSUPERVISION AND \nMANAGEMENT \n \n31.1 It is accepted by the Police Ombudsman that intelligence does not, in \nitself, confirm wrongdoing. The purpose of this element of the \ninvestigation was to determine whether police had complied with the \nrules relating to the use of informants, and the intelligence provided by \nthem, and also to determine whether the investigative opportunities \nderiving from such intelligence had been exploited. \n \n31.2 The mechanisms by which the failings of informant and intelligence \nhandling in this Report should have been either prevented or detected \nat an early stage, did not exist within the RUC Special Branch. Those \nmechanisms should have involved clear and effective policies for the \nhandling of informants, combined with proper and regular training and \neffective intrusive management. \n \n31.3 Informant handling is a sensitive and important task. Mechanisms did \nexist and were used by police forces in the rest of the United Kingdom \n(These were known as the Home Office Guidelines). They were not \nspecifically designed for the purpose of terrorist informants. \nNevertheless they would have provided a structure within which there \nwould have been regular assessment of informants, clearly defined and \nauditable processes for intelligence handling, annual reviews of their \ncontribution and situation, and control over any notified future \noccasions on which  an informant was permitted to engage in crime. \n \n123 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nThis was the process known as “participating informants,” through \nwhich informants could be authorised, within defined limits, to engage \nin crime.  \n \n31.4 This system was used by RUC/PSNI CID, to some extent, prior to \n2000.     \n \n31.5 The rules for participating informants were as follows: \n \n1. the police must never use an informant to encourage another \nperson to commit a criminal offence; \n \n2. the police should not mislead a court about an informant’s \nrole in the commission of a criminal offence, particularly \nwhere the informant had more than a minor role in the \ncriminal act; \n \n3. No member of a police force, and no police informant, should \ncounsel, incite or procure the commission of a crime; \n \n4. Where an informant gives the police information about the \nintention of others to commit a crime in which they intend \nthat he shall play a part, his participation should be allowed \nto continue only where: \n  \ni. He does not actively engage in planning and committing \nthe crime; \n \nii. He is intended to play only a minor role; and  \n \niii. His participation is essential to enable the police to \nfrustrate the principal criminals and to arrest them, \n \n124 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n(albeit for lesser offences such as attempt or \nconspiracy to commit the crime, or carrying \noffensive weapons) before injury is done to any \nperson or serious damage to property. \n \n5. The need to protect an informant does not justify granting \nhim immunity from arrest or prosecution for the crime if he \nfully participates; \n \n6. Where an informant has been used, who has taken part in \nthe commission of a crime for which others have been \narrested, the prosecuting solicitor, counsel, and (where he is \nconcerned) the Director of Public Prosecutions should be \ninformed of the fact and of the part that the informant took in \nthe commission of the offence, although, not necessarily of \nhis identity. \n \n31.6 These rules were not applied by RUC Special Branch. Officers have \nstated that in the context of terrorism, they were “unworkable”. \nAttempts were made in the early 1990s to devise a satisfactory system, \nand approaches were made to Government for the  adoption of a more \nflexible approach to terrorist informant handling.  Government did not \nrespond positively to those approaches.  \n \n31.7 The Police Ombudsman has not been provided by the PSNI with any \ndocumentation which would indicate that any Special Branch informant \nwhose activities were examined during this investigation, were given \nparticipating informant status by the RUC or PSNI for any of the crimes \nthe investigators have examined.  These include the suspected crimes \nof membership of a proscribed organisation and directing terrorism. \nOver the years informants were allegedly involved in a number of \nintelligence led operations managed by senior officers, in relation to \n \n125 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nsituations in which the informants  allegedly committed offences such \nas hijacking, unlawful imprisonment, possession of firearms and of \nexplosives. For all of these offences there is no record of Participating \nInformant status being granted. \n \n31.8 The Assistant Chief Constable Crime Department has told the Police \nOmbudsman that a system for the authorisation of participating \ninformants was developed by the RUC for Special Branch in 2001. \n \n31.9 When information was received, Special Branch officers determined \nwhat intelligence should be disseminated to CID or Uniform police on a \nday-to-day basis. When there had been a terrorist murder, it was the \nresponsibility of local Special Branch officers to liaise with the CID \ninvestigation team, to provide them with relevant information which \ncould assist their enquiries.  The Police Ombudsman has seen \nintelligence, which should have been passed to CID officers \ninvestigating murders, which was deliberately not passed to them, and \nwas marked “No Downward Dissemination”. \n \n31.10 When it became necessary to arrest or charge an informant the Walker \nReport provided that this should only be done in the case of “planned \narrests”.  In accordance with the following rules; it must be  \n \n“cleared with Regional Special Branch to ensure that no agents \nof either RUC or Army are involved. A decision to arrest an \nagent must only be taken after discussion between Special \nBranch and CID. If agreement is not possible the matter will be \nreferred to Assistant Chief Constable level. The charging of an \nagent must be the result of a conscious decision by both Special \nBranch and CID in which the balance of advantage has been \ncarefully weighed.” \n \n \n126 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n31.11 RUC  rules provided also that : \n \n1. Police officers should record as much intelligence as possible on \nofficial documentation since intelligence ‘held in an officer’s \nmemory’ was unlikely to be properly exploited; \n \n2. Until 1995, CID “agents” who were members of “subversive \norganisations” should be handed over to Special Branch or, \nwhere this was not possible, they should be jointly handled by \nSpecial Branch and CID. \n \n3. Special Branch had primacy over CID in terms of joint handling \nof paramilitary informants, until 1995 when CID officers ceased \nto handle paramilitary informants. \n \n4. Officers should assess the continued employment of their \nsources in the light of the information available at the time. \n \n31.12 In 1997 the RUC adopted new rules for the “Management and Use of \nInformants,” modelled on rules produced by the Association of Chief \nPolice Officers [ACPO] in 1995. A former Assistant Chief Constable \ntold the Police Ombudsman in 2003 that Chief Officers of the RUC \nmade a decision, in 1997, that Special Branch should be excluded from \nthe operation of these rules. In 1998 a document was produced for the \nPatten Independent Commission on Policing, stating that all the rules \ndid apply to Special Branch. This clearly was not the case. The \nevidence from officers is that there was no change in Special Branch \npractice until 2000. \n \n31.13 On 25 September 2000, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act \n2000 [RIPA] came into effect. Under the Act informants are referred to \nas “Covert Human Intelligence Sources” [CHIS]. In August 2002 a \n \n127 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n“Covert Human Intelligence Sources: Code of Practice”, came into \nforce in accordance with the Act. \n \n31.14 The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act also established the Office \nof the Surveillance Commissioners. Amongst the responsibilities of the \nSurveillance Commissioners is the review of the practices and \nprocedures used, and the records kept in connection with the \nauthorisations, review, cancellation and risk assessment of CHIS. \n \nSpecial Branch Non-Compliance with the Regulation of \nInvestigatory Powers Act 2000 \n \n31.15  The first three Authorisations for Informant 1 under the Regulation of \nInvestigatory Powers Act did not give a balanced account of Informant \n1’s conduct as a source.  They stated; \n \n “As far as can be ascertained the CHIS is not currently involved in \ncriminality” \n \n31.16  In the early stages of this investigation, the Police Ombudsman had \nimmediate concerns about the Special Branch management of \nInformant 1 and drew them to the attention of the Surveillance \nCommissioner. \n \n31.17 An inspection was carried out for the Surveillance Commissioner, and a \nreport was prepared dated 04 October 2003, which examines the \npolice handling of Informant 1 under RIPA. The report found that \nSpecial Branch failed to meet National Minimum Standards, and failed \nto take into account intelligence about Informant 1’s own criminal \nconduct. It noted a number of deficiencies in the management of \nInformant 1 and it makes the following observations: \n \n \n128 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• “This CHIS is a high risk source and the management process \nhas not been documented to the standard required.  \n• There is a failure to document regular reviews taking into \nconsideration the position of the CHIS in a terrorist organisation \nand the criminal intelligence regarding his own conduct. \n• There has been failure to ensure that the use and conduct of this \nsource has been considered at Chief Officer level.  \n• There has been a failure to secure and preserve original material \nfrom contacts or meetings between handlers and source. \n• There has been a failure to follow the ACPO/HMC&E Manual of \nMinimum Standards in relation to CHIS...” \n \n \nFindings of the Police Ombudsman in Relation to Informant \nHandling, Supervision and Management \n \n31.18 There is evidence of non-compliance by some CID officers with the \nrequirements for the handling of informants. The CID handling of some \ninformants was, on occasion, quite bizarre. Informant 1 was never a \nregistered source for CID and his relationship with his CID handlers \nwas totally inconsistent with RUC requirements for CID handling at the \ntime. PSNI have provided no evidence of sufficient management of the \ninformant handling activities of these officers.  \n \n31.19 The Police Ombudsman has not been provided by PSNI with any \nannual review of informant 1 between 1991 and 1999. The four reviews \nwhich were carried out under the requirements of the Regulation of \nInvestigatory Powers Act did not reflect the level of criminality in which \nInformant 1 was alleged to be involved. They are inaccurate, \nmisleading and do not enable any proper review of the continued \nemployment of Informant 1 by the RUC/PSNI. \n \n \n129 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n31.20 The PSNI Special Branch have provided no clear documentation \nindicative of the fact that senior officers properly supervised the \nhandling by junior officers of informants. In particular senior officers \nwithin Special Branch did not use the process of Participating Informant \nstatus to regulate the activities of informants engaged in crime so as to \nensure that they complied with the Home Office Guidelines. In 1997 a \ndecision was made by Chief Officers that the RUC’s own document on \n“The Management and Use of Informants” would not apply to the \nhandling of Special Branch informants. \n \n \n31.21  Whilst it is accepted that the Home Office Guidelines did not support \nthe complex policing created by the different security situation of \nNorthern Ireland, nevertheless they should not have been ignored. \nThere should have been a system of management, based on clearly \narticulated policy, which regulated the activities of Special Branch. This \ndid not exist. In the absence of policy, officers operated in a difficult \nenvironment on what appears to have been a case by case approach.  \n \n31.22 Despite the work done in 1998 the reality was that there was limited \npolicy and little training provided to Special Branch officers in relation to \nthe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act prior to 2003, to enable \nthem to carry out the various functions which attach to the running of \ninformants and the gathering, management and use of intelligence. \n \n31.23 The PSNI have provided no evidence of any effective intrusive \nmanagement or supervision of informant handling matters by the Chief \nOfficers with responsibility for Special Branch. \n \n31.24 The RUC did not prepare properly for the introduction of the Regulation \nof Investigatory Powers Act. Despite the introduction of new \nprocedures for the overall management of sources, it is clear that some \n \n130 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nRUC / PSNI Special Branch officers failed to comply with the \nRegulation of Investigatory Powers Act in their handling and \nmanagement of Informant 1 from 2000 to 2003.  \n \n31.25 The Special Branch documentation of Informant 1 under the Regulation \nof Investigatory Powers Act is selective, biased, and misleading, and it \nincludes statements that are manifestly untrue.   \n \n31.26 The report by the Surveillance Commissioner in October 2003 found \nthat Special Branch failed to meet National Minimum Standards, and \nfailed to take into account intelligence about Informant 1’s own criminal \nconduct.  The previous report, in February 2003  had stated that , \n \n“The majority of CHIS are working for Special Branch and are well \nhandled and controlled“ \n \n31.27 Prior to 2003 some RUC/PSNI Special Branch officers facilitated the \nsituation in which  Informant 1 was able to continue to act as a senior \nfigure in the UVF, despite the availability of extensive information as to \nhis alleged involvement in crime. Informant 1, by virtue of his alleged \nrank in the UVF, must have been engaged in the direction of terrorism \nand must have known that he was not being dealt with for crime. Some \nRUC/PSNI officers, at all levels, were complicit in the failure to deal \nappropriately with Informant 1, both by way of criminal investigation \nand by dispensing with his services as an informant. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n131 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION SEVEN \n    \nCOLLUSION \n \n32.1   In his Stevens 3 Report Lord Stevens defined collusion as “the wilful \nfailure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding \nof intelligence and evidence, the extreme of agents being involved in \nmurder..” \n \n32.2 In his reports on his Collusion Enquiries into the deaths of Patrick \nFinucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson, and Billy Wright, Judge \nCory states that: \n \n“the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad… That is to say \nthat army and police forces must not act collusively by ignoring or \nturning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants of agents, or \nsupplying information to assist them in their wrongful acts, or \nencouraging them to commit wrongful acts. Any lesser definition would \nhave the effect of condoning or even encouraging state involvement in \ncrimes, thereby shattering all public confidence in these important \nagencies.””  \n \n32.3 The Police Ombudsman has used these definitions for the purposes of \nexamining whether collusion has been identified in the course of this \ninvestigation. \n \n32.4 In the absence of any justifiable reason why officers behaved as they \ndid, the Police Ombudsman has identified from police documentation, \nrecords and interviews, collusion in the following areas: \n \n \n132 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• The failure to arrest informants for crimes to which those \ninformants had allegedly confessed, or to treat such \ninformants as suspects for crime; \n \n• By creating interview notes which were deliberately \nmisleading; by failing to record and maintain original \ninterview notes and by failing to record notes of meetings \nwith informants; \n \n• The failure to deal properly with information received from \ninformants, so that informants were able to avoid \ninvestigation and detection for crime; \n \n• By arresting informants suspected of murder then subjecting \nthem to lengthy sham interviews by their own handlers at \nwhich they were not challenged and then releasing them on \nthe authorisation of the handler;   \n \n• By not recording in investigation papers the fact that an \ninformant was suspected of a crime despite the fact that he \nhad been arrested and interviewed for that crime; \n \n• By failing to take steps to hinder an attempted bombing by \nthe establishment of an operation either to disrupt or arrest \nthe alleged perpetrators whose names were known to \nSpecial Branch; \n \n• By giving instructions to junior officers that records should \nnot be completed, and that there should be no record of the \nincident concerned; \n  \n \n133 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• By ensuring the absence of any official record linking a \nSpecial Branch informant to the possession of explosives \nwhich may, and were thought, according to private police \nrecords, to have been used in a  particular crime; \n \n• By withholding information from CID that the UVF had \nsanctioned an attack; \n \n \n• By concealing from CID intelligence that named persons, \nincluding an informant or informants, had been involved in \nparticular crimes;

\n \n• By not using the available evidence and intelligence to detect \na crime and to link the investigation of crimes in which an \ninformant was a suspect; \n \n• By some Special Branch officers deliberately disregarding a \nvery significant amount of intelligence about informant \ninvolvement in drug dealing in Larne, and North Belfast and \nin punishment attacks linked to drug dealing from 1994 \nonwards; \n \n• By continuing to employ as informants people suspected of \ninvolvement in the most serious crime without assessing the \nattendant risks or their suitability as informants; \n \n135 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n• By not acting on witness and other evidence received in \nparticular crimes when the suspect was an informant;

\n \n• By cancelling the wanted status of murder suspects \n“because of lack of resources” and doing nothing further \nabout these suspects; \n \n• This investigation has examined the activities of police \nofficers responsible for informants over a period of twelve \nyears. On only one occasion have PSNI provided any \ndocument indicative of consideration of the termination of the \nrelationship which Special Branch had with any of these \ninformants, despite the extent of the alleged involvement of \nthese informants in the most serious of crimes. \n \n \n32.5 The RUC decisions not to adopt the rules relating to the handling, \nsupervision and management of informants meant that it is not possible \nto attribute responsibility to individual officers for actual breach of rules \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n137 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nSECTION EIGHT \n    \nCONCLUSIONS AND \nRECOMMENDATIONS \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS OF THE POLICE OMBUDSMAN IN \nRELATION TO THE COMPLAINT MADE BY MR \nRAYMOND MCCORD  \n \n33.1 This investigation began as a consequence of a complaint made by the \nfather of Raymond McCord Junior who was murdered in 1997.  Mr \nMcCord’s complaints were extensive and the initial enquiries rapidly led \nto a decision to conduct a lengthy investigation, an investigation which \nwas expanded as a consequence of the emerging findings of the initial \nenquiries. The conclusions to Mr McCord’s complaint are articulated in \nparagraph 9 of this Report. They are as follows:  \n \nAllegation number one: \nThat a senior UVF figure had ordered the murder of his son, and that \nthis individual was a police informant; \n \nFinding \nThe Police Ombudsman can confirm that a police informant is a \nsuspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son. She cannot confirm or deny \nwho that individual is. \n \n \n \n \n138 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nAllegation number two: \nThat police failed to carry out a thorough investigation of his son’s \nmurder, and failed to keep him updated about their investigation; \n \nFinding \nThe Police Ombudsman has identified failures in the investigation of Mr \nMcCord’s son’s murder. These failures may have significantly reduced \nthe possibility of anyone being prosecuted for the murder. \nThe Police Ombudsman has also substantiated the claim that police \nfailed to keep Mr McCord updated about the investigation.   \n \n \nAllegation number three: \nThat no-one had been arrested or charged with the murder of his son. \nMr McCord alleged that this was because the man who ordered the \nmurder was a police informant, and that this individual, and those \nworking for him, had been protected from arrest and prosecution for a \nnumber of years. \nFindings \n• A number of people were arrested for Raymond McCord Junior’s \nmurder.  No one has been charged with the murder. There is no \nevidence that anyone has been protected from arrest for the murder \nof Raymond McCord Junior. \n \n• With reference to Mr McCord’s allegation that a police informant \nhad ordered his son’s murder, and that this individual and those \nworking for him had been protected from arrest and prosecution for \nyears the Police Ombudsman conducted an extensive investigation \nwhich is to be found in paragraphs 10 et seq.    \n \n \n139 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n• Whilst there had been some arrests of informants over the years, it \nis clear that much intelligence was disregarded and not properly \nmanaged by police.  They continued to use Informant 1 despite his \ncriminal record and the extensive intelligence they held in respect of \nalleged serious criminality. This allegation is therefore substantiated \nwith the exception, firstly, of that part of which it refers to police \nfailure to arrest anyone for Raymond McCord Junior’s murder, and \nsecondly, of the fact that whilst the Police Ombudsman can confirm \nthat an informer is a suspect in the murder of Mr McCord’s son, she \ncannot confirm or deny who that individual is.   \n \n \nAllegation number four \n \nThat unidentified police knew something was going to happen to \nRaymond McCord Junior, but that they did not warn him or his family \nabout this danger to protect the police informer who was responsible \nfor the murder. \n \nFinding \n \nThe Police Ombudsman has found no evidence or intelligence to \nsupport this allegation. It is not substantiated. \n \n \nOTHER CONCLUSIONS OF THE POLICE OMBUDSMAN \nIN THIS INVESTIGATION \n \n33.2 Operation Ballast analysed a small part of the informant handling of \nSpecial Branch RUC/PSNI. The investigation examined the activities of \na number of Special Branch officers of all ranks in relation to Informant \n1, and also the other informants who were associated with him. There \n \n140 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nis no reason to believe that the findings of this investigation are \nisolated. Indeed given that many of the failings identified in the course \nof the investigation were systemic, this is highly likely and the \nimplications of this are very serious. \n \n33.3 There have been various reviews and enquiries over the years into \nintelligence and informant handling by the RUC. Recommendations \nhave been made. Some of these enquiries have been very high profile \nenquiries, such as the Stevens and Stalker enquiries.  The Patten \nIndependent Commission on Policing also made recommendations \nabout the reform of Special Branch and its proper integration into crime \noperations. Prior to 2002, when Mr McCord made his complaint, the \nvarious reports had had very little impact on policies and practices \nwithin Special Branch. \n \n33.4 In the course of this investigation it has emerged that all of the \ninformants at the centre of this investigation were members of the UVF. \nThere was no effective strategic management of these informants, and \nas a consequence of the practices of Special Branch, the position of \nthe UVF particularly, in North Belfast and Newtownabbey, was \nconsolidated and strengthened. \n \n33.5 The handling of informants by Detective Sergeant M and Detective \nConstable A was not satisfactory. There was no management \nintervention to ensure that informants were registered properly, and no \nreview of the officers’ performance as handlers. PSNI have provided no \nevidence that any action was taken by the RUC to deal with this. \n \n33.6 Special Branch systems for information management, dissemination \nand retention were seriously defective. In effect handlers, and on \noccasion controllers, determined what information went into such \nsystems as did exist. Those systems which did exist were not effective.  \n \n141 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nThere is evidence that information was withheld by handlers. \nInstructions were given that matters should not be recorded. The \ngeneral absence of records has prevented senior officers, who clearly \nhave significant responsibility for the failings, from being held to \naccount. It is abundantly clear that this was not an oversight, but was a \ndeliberate strategy and had the effect of avoiding proper accountability. \nThe former ACC Crime Operations has described this situation as one \nof “plausible deniability”. \n \n33.7 The senior management of the RUC/PSNI would have been well aware \nof the various statutory and policy requirements relevant to the \nhandling and management of informants. The RUC/PSNI was \nrepresented on national working parties formulating such policy. There \nwas however a disregard for such policies and for the law. This had the \neffect over the years of ensuring that individuals could not be held to \naccount for significant decisions made.  \n \n33.8 Police officers at all levels working in Special Branch very often \ndetermined the future dissemination, if any, of intelligence held within \nSpecial Branch, to officers outside Special Branch. Had the necessary \nsystems of accountability been in place the situation which is described \nin this Report should not have arisen. However the reality was that a \nConstable or a Sergeant could, and did, refuse to divulge information \neven to senior officers, and the mechanisms by which the decisions of \nindividual Special Branch officers could be challenged were not used \neffectively by senior officers. The Special Branch liaison officer for any \nparticular investigation, who was responsible for the verbal passing of \ninformation, was very often the handler of an informant who was a \nprime suspect for the particular crime.  The Police Ombudsman also \nidentified abuses of the existing controls for dissemination which often \nresulted in the failure to disseminate information at an appropriate time.  \n \n142 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nThere was no documented record of the reasons for the decision \nmaking in this area. \n \n33.9 It would be easy, and indeed tempting, to examine and severely \ncriticise the junior officers’ conduct in dealing with the various \ninformants. These officers are not blameless. However they could not \nhave operated as they did without knowledge and support at the \nhighest levels of the RUC/PSNI. Chief Officers should have been \naware of the processes used. The most serious failings are at Chief \nOfficer level, particularly those Chief Officers who were responsible for \nSpecial Branch, since they are responsible for ensuring that training \nand systems are put in place to meet legal and policy requirements. \n \n33.10 A culture of subservience to Special Branch developed within the RUC. \nOfficers in the rest of the RUC have articulated quite clearly that \nSpecial Branch maintained control over those normal ethical policing \nactivities which might affect either Special Branch informants or Special \nBranch operations. The consequence of this was that, in the absence \nof effective Chief Officer Management of Special Branch, it acquired \ndomination over the rest of the organization which inhibited some \nnormal policing activities. \n \n33.11 The effect of that dysfunction was that, whilst undoubtedly Special \nBranch officers were effective in preventing bombings and shootings \nand other attacks, some informants were able to continue to engage in \nterrorist activities including murders without the Criminal Investigation \nDepartment having the ability to deal with them for some of those \noffences. \n \n33.12 On occasions this also resulted in crimes being committed by \ninformants with the prior knowledge of Special Branch officers. \nInformants engaged in such crimes were not subject to any of the \n \n143 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \ncontrols inherent in the system for the use of Participating Informants \ndevised by the Home Office for use by all police forces. On occasion, \ndespite the fact that they had not given informants Participating \nInformant status, police nevertheless watched as serious terrorist \ncrimes were committed by their informants. \n \n33.13 The Police Ombudsman was concerned also at the attitude of some \nSpecial Branch and CID officers to their obligations as police officers. \nSome officers have articulated the belief that they had no function \nbeyond intelligence gathering. Successive Police Acts have provided \nthat the primary duties of a police officer are to protect life and \nproperty, and to prevent and detect crime.  \n \n33.14 Whilst acting as an informant, and with the knowledge of some Special \nBranch and some CID officers, informants moved through the ranks of \nthe UVF to senior positions. The evidence clearly shows that Informant \n1’s behaviour, including alleged murder, was not challenged by Special \nBranch, and the activities of those who sought to bring him to justice \nwere blocked repeatedly. Records were minimized, exaggerated, \nfabricated and must also have been destroyed. Informant 1 would have \nbeen well aware of the level of protection which he was afforded.  \n \n33.15 It is also the case that whilst he was engaged in drug dealing and other \nmoney making activities, Informant 1 was not only protected by Special \nBranch but he was also given large sums of public money in return for \nsuch services as he provided.  Indeed on one occasion he is recorded \nas having provided information which led police to stop a car containing \nhim and two other leading UVF men, all of whom were police \ninformants. No arrests followed and Informant 1 was paid £3,000.  The \ntotal amount estimated to have been paid to Informant 1 over 12 years \nis in excess of £79,000.   \n \n \n144 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n33.16 This investigation demonstrates graphically the dangers of a separated \nand effectively unaccountable specialist intelligence department with \nextensive and largely uncontrolled powers.  No effective analysis could \nhave been made by the RUC/PSNI over the years of the implications of \nthe totality of the information about, and activities of, the informants \nwho have been identified during this investigation. \n \n33.17 In many other crimes described in this report there were witnesses, \nwho either drew police attention to a crime or volunteered to give \nevidence, some of it quite specific. There was also one occasion on \nwhich the victim of a punishment shooting gave extensive information \nto the police about what had happened to him.   In all these situations \nthe individuals involved were either seeking to assist the police or to be \nprotected by the police. The Police Ombudsman has found that on a \nnumber of occasions the police did not use these opportunities to \nfurther their investigations. This had two consequences: firstly the \ninvestigation did not proceed, and secondly failure by police to use \nevidence tendered by witnesses to paramilitary shootings and other \nactivity, must have given rise to a lack of confidence among the people \nthat there was any point in assisting the police when such crimes were \ncommitted. The consequence of this would inevitably have been that \nthe police became less effective and the community confidence in \npolicing was reduced.  \n \n33.18 This investigation demonstrates that one of the greatest dangers to any \nanti-terrorist work is that, if those charged with intelligence gathering \nand investigation do not abide by the rules, and if those who manage \nthem do not operate effectively to ensure compliance with both law and \npolicy, the risk of terrorist attacks is enhanced, not reduced. \n \n33.19 It remains the case that there are many officers within the RUC/PSNI \nwho served bravely and honourably, some even making the ultimate \n \n145 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nsacrifice. On many occasions in the course of the work of the office, the \nPolice Ombudsman has identified examples of excellent policing. This \nis in stark contrast to the activities and systemic failures identified in \nthis report.  \n \n33.20 Since 2003 the PSNI has made significant changes and introduced \nnew policies and working practices in relation to its strategic \nmanagement of Crime Operations Department, which now incorporates \nSpecial Branch (now Intelligence Branch) under a single Assistant \nChief Constable. A description of those changes is contained in \nAppendix A of this Report. It is hoped that the further necessary \nchanges consequential upon this Report will combine with the change \nalready made, to ensure that never again, within the PSNI, will there be \nthe circumstances which prevailed for so long in relation to informant \nhandling and intelligence management and which are articulated in this \nReport.  \n \n33.21 It is evident that the arrangements for ensuring compliance by the \nPSNI with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act were ineffective \nbetween 2000 and 2003. Before the Police Ombudsman drew these \nmatters to his attention, the Surveillance Commissioner had not been \nable to identify the misleading documentation which was created by \nsome Special Branch officers.  Recent Surveillance Commissioner \nreports have identified very significant improvements but the most \nrecent report still identifies areas for development.  It is essential that in \nthe arrangements for the future strategic management of National \nSecurity issues in Northern Ireland, there will be accountability \nmechanisms which are effective and which are capable of ensuring \nthat what has happened here does not recur.   \n \n \n \n146 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nThe Police Ombudsman presented her recommendations to the Chief \nConstable prior to the publication of this report.  His response is as follows: \n \n“We welcome the opportunity to respond to these recommendations.  Our response to \nthe report itself will be made when we have had sight of the full text and its \nconclusions.  We have detailed below our acceptance of the recommendations and the \nactions which have been or will be taken in respect of each one.” \n \n \n34.1 This investigation has shown that within the UVF in North Belfast and \nNewtownabbey there was a network of informants, some of whom held \nsenior positions.  There should be a thorough investigation of all crimes \nwith which those informants have been associated, in the course of \nwhich PSNI should re-interview the Special Branch handlers and \ncontrollers who are responsible for them.  These officers may have \nfurther information about the informants’ criminal offences, which has \nnot been officially documented. Any indication of criminal behaviour by \na serving or retired officer which emerges in the course of the PSNI \ninvestigations which are initiated, following this Report by the Police \nOmbudsman, should be referred to the Police Ombudsman for \ninvestigation. \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted and its implementation is already \nunderway.  The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) became operational \nin January 2006. The McCord case was one of the first cases to be \ngiven to HET to re-examine, at the direction of the Chief Constable. \n(This was under one of the exemption criteria from the normal \nchronological process, as a matter of serious public interest). \nWhen HET examines a case, it also looks at others linked to it.  The \nMcCord case is one of those examined in this report, and is linked to a \nnumber of other incidents.  HET will be undertaking a thorough re-\nexamination of these cases contemporaneously because of linking \nfactors. \nThe HET has a good relationship with the Office of the Police \nOmbudsman, including regular meetings between senior colleagues.  A \nprotocol exists for the referral of relevant matters to the Office of the \nPolice Ombudsman from HET if investigations uncover evidence that \npoints to the involvement of police officers in serious crime. \n \n \n34.2 As a matter of urgency the PSNI must investigate Informant 1 as a \nsuspect for all the unsolved murders, attempted murders and other \nserious crime for which he remains a suspect. The PSNI should \n \n147 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nconsider these crimes as linked incidents.  The PSNI has the \nresponsibility to restore public confidence in what has been a number \nof seriously flawed investigations.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted and in fact the Police Service \ncommenced this process in January 2006, with the referral of the \nMcCord case to HET.  Other linked cases are gradually being adopted \ninto the investigation in a structured and managed fashion.  HET will be \nassisted by the analytical work conducted by the Office of the Police \nOmbudsman in the preparation of their report. \n \n \n34.3 Twenty-four percent of informants were cancelled, following the Police \nOmbudsman’s intervention in March and September 2003, and the \nrecommendations made by Lord Stevens.  Twelve percent of all \ninformants were cancelled, because of their ongoing involvement in \nserious criminality.  Those informants should now be investigated for \ntheir suspected serious crime.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. At the time of the CHIS review in \n2003/04 CHIS suspected of involvement in Serious Crimes were \nreferred to CID investigators for investigation. In the light of this \nrecommendation relevant cases will be referred to the Historical \nEnquiry Team for further review and investigation. \n \n \n34.4 Following the recent changes made by PSNI, they should continue to \nensure that all officers in Intelligence Branch (formerly Special Branch) \nreceive full training, consistent with national policing standards in the \narea of informant handling, in all their responsibilities and legal \nobligations, and that that training is regularly updated.   \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. Training is an ongoing commitment \nand is carried out to national standards. During the past 12 months 290 \nC3 personnel received relevant intelligence training. All staff involved in \nCHIS management will undergo further training in 2007. \n \n \n34.5 As PSNI acquires sufficient trained detectives those appointed to \nIntelligence Branch in the future should have detective training, to \nenable them to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively, as a \nconsequence of their enhanced ability to understand the specific \nrequirements of Investigating Officers.   \n \n \n148 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. All detectives in Intelligence Branch \nare in the process of being provided with detective training. All Police \nOfficers appointed to CHIS handling duties are now required to have \nCID detective experience prior to appointment. \n \n \n34.6 The Chief Constable should continue to review current process with a \nview to ongoing effective dissemination of intelligence received by the \nPSNI Crime Operations Department.    \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. We agree that continuous review is \nimportant and it is core to the way we do business. The procedures for \nthe dissemination of intelligence to investigators is covered by way of a \nwritten protocol.  Following the transfer of National Security lead to the \nSecurity Service intelligence will continue to be disseminated to \ninvestigators according to the PSNI protocols. This is one of the 5 \nprinciples outlined at a previous Policing Board meeting. \n \n \n34.7 The Chief Constable should review the continued deployment in \nIntelligence Branch of those few officers who appear, by virtue of this \ninvestigation, to be uninformed of critical issues in relation to the role \nand functions they are required to carry out, to determine their \nsuitability for the difficult work of informant handling, management and \nsupervision.   \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted and we agree that it is critical that all \nofficers are clear on any critical issues relating to their role and \nfunction. The PSNI will examine in detail the content of the PONI report \nand, should it be ascertained that an office is deemed unsuitable for a \nparticular Intelligence Branch function, appropriate management action \nwill be taken. \n \n \n34.8 PSNI should operate processes to ensure that informant handlers \nchange at sufficiently regular intervals and that Intelligence Branch \nremains integrated within Crime Operations Department in accordance \nwith best practice for specialised and vulnerable posts in United \nKingdom policing.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. A policy is in place requiring that \nhandlers should not remain with a CHIS for a protracted period.   \n \n \n149 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n34.9 The PSNI and the Police Ombudsman experienced significant difficulty \nin retrieving intelligence for the purposes of this investigation.  Part of \nthat difficulty derives from the current processes for the recording and \nidentification of information as it is received as intelligence.  Those \nprocesses have been reviewed to ensure that in the future intelligence \nwill be more readily accessible and retrievable. However it is essential \nthat the process and information technology changes arising from this \nreview are completed as rapidly as possible.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. We acknowledge that intelligence \nretrieval is essential.  To that end Intelligence Branch continues to \nreview and update its records management processes. A specific IT \nstrategy for Intelligence Branch to address the Branch’s needs in the \nshort, medium and long term is currently in draft form. It will be \napproved for action shortly.   \n \n \n34.10 This investigation, like others, has identified a total absence of \noperational records in respect of certain intelligence operations.  \nAlthough there are now new procedures in place, PSNI should review \nthe effectiveness of those processes to ensure there is total \ncompliance with the requirements of the law, administrative processes \nand a high level of professionalism under the new arrangements.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. Records pertaining to operations \nand investigations are now retained in accordance with PSNI policy \nand in compliance with CPIA legal requirements. The effectiveness of \nthese procedures will be monitored to ensure that the highest \nstandards are maintained.   \n \n \n \n34.11 The Police Ombudsman is aware that many officers and retired officers \nmay have police materials and documentation in their possession.  The \nChief Constable should ensure that every effort is made to recover all \nsuch materials and documentation.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. In fact, instructions have already \nbeen issued to police officers prohibiting the retention of journals by \nofficers currently serving or those who are retiring. A renewed request \nwill be made to retired police officers to report and return any police \nmaterial in their possession building on previous work in this area.   \n \n \n150 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \n34.12 The Chief Constable must remind all officers of their legal obligations \nunder Section 66 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 and \nRegulation 8 of the RUC (Complaints etc) Regulations 2000.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. PSNI officers have already been \nreminded of this legal requirement.  Furthermore a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding between the Police Ombudsman’s Office and Crime \nOperations was signed on 17 August 2005. This document outlines the \nabove legislative obligations. We will use internal communication tools \nto further heighten awareness among officers of their obligations. .   \n \n \n34.13 The Chief Constable must ensure that there is no continued obstruction \nof the Police Ombudsman such as experienced in this investigation.   \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted and is linked to the previous \nrecommendation. Police Officers have been made aware that the \nOmbudsman’s powers as set out in Section 66 of the Police (Northern \nIreland) Act 2000 and Regulation 8 of the RUC (Complaints etc) \nRegulations 2000, supersede those in other legislation that restrict the \nsharing of information, eg Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Act. \n \n \n34.14 The PSNI should consider the introduction of the practice of \nOperational Risk Advisors, as used by the Serious Organised Crime \nAgency, or introduce a sensitive policing desk / department to provide \nconsistent advice on sensitive and covert policing issues, to ensure \nthat such operations comply with all the requirements of the law.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted.  In preparation for the transfer of \nNational Security to MI5 the introduction of operational risk assessors \nwill be considered. The PSNI will liaise with other agencies to identify \nany other good practice in this regard.  \n \n \n34.15 PSNI should review procedures for the provision of confidential \ninformation to the Public Prosecution Service in order to ensure the \naccuracy of the information provided in compliance with the Criminal \nProceedings and Investigations Act.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted.  PSNI has already amended \nprocedures to ensure that all relevant material, including sensitive \n \n151 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nmaterial is revealed to prosecutors. Given the importance of this issue, \nit is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure the procedures are \nobserved. \n \n \n34.16 The PSNI are required to introduce and to monitor the effectiveness of \nnew systems for the gathering of intelligence from prisons.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. A new Memorandum of \nUnderstanding has been prepared in consultation with the prison \nservice. This sets out the procedures for sharing intelligence between \nPSNI Intelligence Branch and Prison Service. Additional dedicated staff \nare being appointed to these duties. \n \n \n34.17 Although the Surveillance Commissioner is not within the jurisdiction of \nthe Police Ombudsman, the Police Ombudsman nevertheless \nrecommends that the Chief Surveillance Commissioner considers \nwhether the current processes adopted by his Office are sufficient to \nensure that the service offered by the Surveillance Commissioner is \nadequate to ensure compliance with the law, at this unprecedented \nperiod of threat to the National Security of the United Kingdom.    \n \n  \n34.18 During the course of this investigation, and others, the Police \nOmbudsman has identified inadequacies in the procedures for the \ndissemination of all levels of information between the PSNI and An \nGarda Síochána. The two organisations should ensure that there are \nclearly described and auditable processes to enable effective policing \noperations in both jurisdictions.  \n \nChief Constable’s response: \nThis recommendation is accepted. Procedures are already in place to \nensure intelligence passed to An Garda Siochana by PSNI Intelligence \nBranch is fully documented. In the light of this recommendation PSNI \nwill liaise with An Garda Siochana and carry out a review of those \nprocedures to identify any areas upon which PSNI can improve. \n \n \n34.19 In light of the forthcoming transfer of National Security matters to the \nSecurity Service MI5, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary should \nconduct a thematic inspection of the new PSNI processes for informant \nhandling, controlling and management, with a view, particularly, to \nidentifying any legislative or administrative changes which may be \nrequired to enable the effective handling and management of Covert \nHuman Intelligence Sources within terrorist networks. \n \n152 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n \nThis recommendation is accepted by Her Majesty’s Inspector of \nConstabulary. \n \n \n34.20 The Northern Ireland Policing Board should establish a mechanism to \nreview the PSNI response to the recommendations made in this Report \nwithin a period of six months and at appropriate intervals thereafter.  \n \n153 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \nAPPENDIX A  \n \nCHANGES TO PSNI WORKING \nPRACTICES SINCE 2003 \n \n \n1. In the early stages of Operation Ballast, the Police Ombudsman made \nit clear to the Chief Constable that she had serious concerns about the \nway PSNI had handled and managed paramilitary informants since the \nearly 1990s. The Police Ombudsman informed the Chief Constable \nthat as a result of these concerns she was conducting a criminal \ninvestigation into the actions of a number of Special Branch officers. \n \n2. As a result of these pressures from the Police Ombudsman, along with \nthe Stevens III recommendations and a report by the Surveillance \nCommissioner, PSNI have radically changed their working practices \nsince 2003. \n \n3. The main change has been structural, in that Special Branch is no \nlonger a separate part of the PSNI, but has been integrated into the \nbroader Crime Operations Department. \n \n4. The old Special Branch ‘E’ Department has been replaced by C3 \nbranch, which works alongside branches C1 [Investigation of \nOrganised Crime] and C2 [Investigation of Serious Crime]. This \nintegration of C3 with Crime Investigation Departments has changed \nthe structure and now has huge potential benefits for the way that PSNI \ndeals with intelligence in the future.  \n \n \n154 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n5. It is no longer the prerogative of senior figures within Special Branch to \ndetermine whether information is withheld from Crime Operations \nBranch. \n \n6. The Assistant Chief Constable for Crime Operations now takes ultimate \nresponsibility for the whole of C Department, including C3. This means \nthat one ACC has an overview of what were previously disparate \nSpecial Branch and CID functions. \n \n7. This ACC ultimately holds responsibility across Crime Operations \nDepartment for the appropriate sharing of information between CID and \nIntelligence Branch within Crime Operations Branch. \n \n8. In October 2003 PSNI instigated a major review of the informants they \nemployed, with the creation of a CHIS Risk Analysis Group. This \nreview of informants is commonly known as the “CRAG review”. \n \n9. The CRAG review examined all informants employed by the PSNI, as \nwell as informants who were run by the military with the knowledge of \nPSNI. Its remit was to ensure that the PSNI employment of informants \nwas proportionate in relation the terrorist threat, in compliance with \nRecommendation 11 of the Stevens III report. \n \n10. As a result of the CRAG review, 24% of all PSNI informants had their \nrelationship with PSNI terminated. Half of these terminations were \nbecause the informants no longer had access to relevant intelligence. \nThe other half of these terminations were because the CRAG review \nfound that the informant had been too deeply involved in criminal \nactivity for their continued employment to meet the legal and ethical \nstandards set by RIPA. \n \n \n155 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n11. This meant that prior to the CRAG review around 12% of PSNI \ninformants were implicated in criminality to an extent that exceeded the \nlegal and ethical standards set by RIPA. This confirms that Informant 1 \nis not an isolated example of a rogue source, but rather an illustration \nof wider failings in the Special Branch handling and management of \ninformants. \n \n12. The CRAG review designated as “high-risk” all those remaining \ninformants who were either members or supporters of proscribed \norganisations. It introduced a control mechanism at ACC level to \nauthorise such high risk informants.   \n \n13. The CRAG review also required specific annual authorisations for \n“membership / support” of proscribed groups, and established that the \nactivities of such informants must be reviewed by a Superintendent \nevery 3 months.  \n \n14. The CRAG review established that involvement in any criminal offence, \nother than membership or support of a proscribed organisation, had to \nbe the subject of an application to the ACC of Crime Operations, who \nwould approve or refuse the request. \n \n15. The CRAG review directs that all criminal activity by paramilitary \ninformants has to be strictly documented and controlled. \n \n16. The Police Ombudsman considers that, while the CRAG review caters \nfor the specific demands of the terrorist situation in Northern Ireland, it \nshows a concerted attempt by PSNI to bring its working practices in \nline with the principles of Home Office Circular 35/1986. \n \n \n156 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n17. PSNI also took a number of further measures to ensure that their \nhandling and management of informants complied with legal and \nethical standards of best practice. \n18.  In February 2004 PSNI introduced new guidelines on the dissemination \nof intelligence to police officers investigating serious crimes, such as \nmurder. PSNI recognised that their previous practices in this regard \nwere inadequate, and that: \n \n “ The perception was that the balance was tilted towards source \nprotection rather than the needs of the investigation.” \n \n19. The new guidelines outline the circumstances in which intelligence \nmust be passed to the Senior Investigating Officer of a murder \ninvestigation. They specifically address the issue of informants who are \nthemselves suspected of murder, and they outline how intelligence \nshould be disseminated to the Senior Investigating Officer in such \ncases. \n \n20. Also in February 2004, PSNI introduced a system of detailed checks on \nindividuals who may be approached to become informants. These \nchecks research an individual’s Criminal Record, as well as their \nintelligence history on all PSNI databases. \n \n21.  Once an individual has been registered as an informant, these \nintelligence and Criminal Record checks have to be updated each year, \nas part of the annual review of the informant’s employment as a \nsource. \n \n22.  In April 2004 PSNI directed that all original notes of meetings with \ninformants should be retained, in compliance with the CPIA. \n \n \n157 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n23. Also in April 2004, PSNI issued internal guidance which emphasised that \nofficers should conduct proper Risk Assessments of informants, in line \nwith the ACPO Manual of Minimum Standards.  \n \n24. Officers have been instructed that Risk Assessments do not solely apply \nto the security of the informant, but that they also involve issues such as \nthe corporate responsibility of PSNI and the wider risks to the community \nas a whole.  \n \n25. Officers have also undergone extensive training in complying with ACPO \nstandards of handling and managing informants. In August 2004 PSNI \nstipulated that only ACPO-trained officers were allowed to handle or \nmanage informants \n \n26. In August 2004 PSNI also introduced stricter guidelines around obtaining \ninformation from members of the public who were not registered \ninformants. This clarified working practices in relation to individuals who \nwere previously treated as “Casual Contacts”.  \n \n \n27. PSNI also introduced a Manual for the Management of CHIS, which \ncovered the use of informants both for the investigation of crime and in \nthe interests of National Security, and applied similar principles to each \ntype of informant. \n \n28. In December 2004 PSNI created a Central Authorisation Bureau, whose \nfunction is to ensure that PSNI comply with RIPA in their authorisation, \nreview, and general employment of informants. This bureau sits \nindependently of C3, and it conducts formal audits of the C3 \nmanagement of informants. PSNI now conduct routine criminal record \nchecks as part of this process. \n \n \n158 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n29. During 2004 and 2005 all Authorising Officers involved in the \nmanagement of informants within PSNI were trained to ACPO standards. \n \n30. In December 2005 PSNI set out new guidelines in relation to the \nmanagement of informant payments and financial records.  \n \n31. Also in December 2005, PSNI issued a Policy Directive to implement the \nNational Intelligence Model. The National Intelligence Model sets out \nprinciples for obtaining the best quality intelligence to combat crime at \ncommunity, regional, and national levels. \n \n32. A key principle of the National Intelligence Model is for intelligence to be \nshared appropriately between different police departments.  \n \n33. The National Intelligence Model also advocates the analysis of \nintelligence to identify trends in criminal activity, and to direct police \nresources to focus on highly active criminals. It notes that intelligence \ncan assist in the arrest and prosecution of such individuals, by \nhighlighting patterns of behaviour and identifying tactical options to work \nagainst them. \n \n34. By adopting the National Intelligence Model, PSNI has committed itself \nto the thorough documentation and analysis of intelligence at every level \nof policing, as part of a pro-active approach to combating serious crime. \n \n35. These changes to PSNI working practice in the handling and \nmanagement of informants have been the subject of positive comment \nby the Surveillance Commissioners and by the Northern Ireland Policing \nBoard. \n \n36. The Surveillance Commissioner notes in his 2005 Inspection Report: \n \n \n159 \n                                                                        \n PUBLIC STATEMENT \n37. The Surveillance Commissioner notes in his 2005 Inspection Report: \n \n “There is now a new Manual for the Management of Covert Human \nIntelligence Sources. This is an excellent document, giving clear \ncorporate guidance and compliant with the legislation and the CHIS code \nof practice.” \n38. The Northern Ireland Policing Board Annual Report for 2005 notes: \n \n “The adoption by the PSNI of a Manual for the Management of Covert \nHuman Intelligence Sources, a procedure for the dissemination of \nintelligence to serious crime investigators, and a procedure for handling \nconfidential information supplied by members of the public is an \nimportant initiative.” \n39. These new internal guidelines have radically changed the PSNI \napproach to informant-handling and have brought the management of \nPSNI informants into line, at least on paper, with current legal and ethical \nstandards. \n \n40.  The PSNI have now adopted the principles of the ACPO, HM Revenue \nand Customs, SOCA and Centrex guidance on the Management of \nCovert Human Intelligence Sources.    \n \n 41.  The Police Ombudsman hopes that these new measures by PSNI will \nprevent the failures identified by Operation Ballast from re-occurring in \nthe future.  \n \n \n160 \n                                                                        \n PUBLI PUBLIC C ST  STAT ATEM EMEN ENT T  \n \n  \n161  161 \n                                                                                                                                                 \n  \n",

For further details and a summary of all \n1\nchanges, see the recent research paper from the Members’ Research Service.  \nThis paper provides key statistics for Swansea East Assembly Constituency area, under a number of \ntopic headings. It is part of a series of Members’ Research Service profiles for the new constituencies \nand regions in Wales (those that will take effect for the Assembly election in May 2007), published in \nMarch 2007. Each of the 40 constituencies has a separate profile, and statistics for the five Assembly \nelectoral regions have been brought together in a single paper. \nThe Members’ Research Service produced a series of profiles for local authorities in November 2006. \nThe content of the profiles for constituencies and regions differ from those produced for local authorities. \nSince electoral geographies do not form a standard statistical geography, and because the new areas \nare not yet in force, the availability of data at this level is limited. These profiles therefore do not contain \nthe detailed commentary and charts showing trends that were available for local authorities.  \nTwo constituencies (Blaenau Gwent and Ynys Môn/Isle of Anglesey) are also local authorities, so as well \nas their profiles in this constituency series, these areas have profiles which were produced for the local \nauthority series in November 2006, with some different data and more detailed commentary. \n \nStructure of this paper \nThis introduction is followed by a map of the Swansea East area and a summary providing an overview \nof key facts about Swansea East. The next sections show four tables with statistics for several topic \nareas, and a section on deprivation. The information is drawn from several different sources, with details \non the sources and definitions in use listed in the last section on ‘sources and notes’. \nThe tables in this paper show statistics for Swansea East along with comparable figures for the region \n(South Wales West) and for Wales as a whole.  \nActual results for past elections are not included in any of these profiles as they are not valid for many of \nthe new constituencies or regions given the boundary changes. Following the Assembly election in May \n2007, election statistics will be available for each new constituency and region. \n                                                 \n1\n Members’ Research Service, Assembly Constituencies and Electoral Regions \nhttp://assembly/presidingoffic/mrs/briefings/2007/mrs062541%20research%20paper%20-\n%20assembly%20constituencies%20and%20electoral%20regions.doc\n1  \nMembers’ Research Service: Research Paper \nGwasanaeth Ymchwil yr Aelodau: Papur Ymchwil \nSources for further information \nThe statistics shown in this paper have been compiled by Members’ Research Service, or supplied on \nrequest by the Statistical Directorate of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Office for National \nStatistics and the Department for Work and Pensions.  \nLittle data is currently available for the new Assembly electoral areas, as statistics tend to be compiled \nfor new geographies after they come into force. Over the coming months, statistics for the new areas \n(and for existing constituencies which continue as Parliamentary constituencies until the next General \nelection) may become available through the sources described below: \n2\n♦ the website for the Statistical Directorate of the Welsh Assembly Government; \n3\n♦ the Office for National Statistics website ; \n4\n♦ the official labour market statistics website ‘nomis’ ; \n5\n♦ the ‘statistics and research’ section of the Department for Work and Pensions’ website . \n \n                                                 \n2\n http://www.wales.gov.uk/statistics\n3\n http://www.statistics.gov.uk/\n4\n http://www.nomisweb.co.uk\n5\n http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/\n2 \nTP \nMap of Swansea East Constituency \n \n3  \nMembers’ Research Service: Research Paper \nGwasanaeth Ymchwil yr Aelodau: Papur Ymchwil \nSummary \nThe following points provide a brief overview of Swansea East, drawn from detailed statistics in the main \nbody of this paper. Technical terms have been avoided, and in general the reference periods of the \nstatistics are not mentioned (as these vary, and in each case the most recently available data are \nshown). \n• Following a review by the Boundary Commission for Wales, there are changes to the boundaries \nof Assembly constituencies and Assembly electoral regions that take effect for the Assembly \nelection in May 2007. Swansea East experienced no changes as a result of the review. \n• Around 76,000 people live in Swansea East, which with 1,563 people per square kilometre is \nmore densely populated than Wales as a whole. \n• The area's population rose by 0.6% between 2001 and 2004, compared to a rise of 1.5% across \nWales. \n• At 1 December 2006, in Swansea East there were around 59,400 electors registered on the \nelectoral roll and entitled to vote in an Assembly election. \n• A lower share of the population in Swansea East (18.2%) than in Wales (20.4%) is of retirement \nage. \n• An estimated 89% of the area's residents were born in Wales, and 11.2% of people aged three or \nmore can speak Welsh, compared to 20.5% across Wales. \n• Compared to Wales, a slightly lower proportion of working age people in Swansea East are in \nemployment (70.1%), and a higher proportion are claiming Job-Seekers' Allowance (3%). \n• Proportionally, more adults aged 16 to 74 in Swansea East than in Wales have no qualifications, \nand noticeably fewer pupils achieved five or more GCSEs grade A*-C in the area than in Wales \n(40% and 54% respectively). \n• Compared to Wales, the pupil teacher ratio in Swansea East is slightly lower in primary schools, \nand higher in secondary schools. \n• In Swansea East, a higher percentage of people than in Wales reported having a limiting long-\nterm illness (25.8%), and a higher percentage of the working age than in Wales claim incapacity \nbenefits (14.8%). \n• There are around 31,500 households in the area, a noticeably lower proportion of which are \nowner occupied than across Wales (66.7% and 71.3% respectively). \n• The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005 ranks specific small areas in Wales in terms of \ndeprivation: 27% of Swansea East’s areas fall in the 10% most deprived areas in Wales, and the \nmajority of its areas are more deprived than the Wales average. \n \n4  \nMembers’ Research Service: Research Paper \nGwasanaeth Ymchwil yr

\nThe Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005 (WIMD) is a measure of deprivation for small areas in \nWales. It ranks statistical geographies known as Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in terms of \ndeprivation across various domains such as health and employment, as well as providing an overall \ndeprivation rank. Although WIMD does not provide deprivation ranks for constituencies as a whole it is \npossible to look at the rank of LSOAs within a constituency. \nIn Swansea East (which has 49 LSOAs): \n• 13 LSOAs (27%) fall within the 10% most deprived LSOAs in Wales; \n• The majority (63%) of LSOAs are more deprived than the Wales average (i.e. the median area \naccording to WIMD ranking, so half of all LSOAs in Wales are more deprived and half are less \ndeprived than the ‘Wales average’). \nIn relation to Wales as a whole, this means that a relatively high proportion of areas in Swansea East are \namong the 10% most deprived, and overall the majority of areas fall in the more deprived half of Wales. \n \nFigure 1 shows what proportion of Swansea East's LSOAs are in the 10% most deprived in Wales for \neach individual domain as well as for overall deprivation.  \n \nFigure 1: The % of LSOAs in Swansea East that are in the 10% most deprived LSOAs in Wales, for overall \ndeprivation and by domain, 2005 \n \n%\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nIncome Overall Education Health Employment Environment Housing Geographical\ndeprivation Access to\nServices\n \n \nSource: Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005\n \n6\nThese statistics were compiled from WIMD data in StatsWales Table 002456 .

The electoral area population estimates are an aggregation of \npreviously published Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) population estimates. Information about the \nONS small area population estimates project can be found on the National Statistics website: \nwww.statistics.gov.uk/sape\nThere is a single LSOA W01000086 (Gwynedd 008B) which extends into two assembly constituencies - \nArfon and Dwyfor Meirionnydd, which cover different Electoral Regions (Mid & West Wales and North \nWales). The mid-2001 and mid-2004 population estimates for W01000086 have been split to the two \nassembly constituencies based on the identifiable number of properties within each km grid square using \nan OS 1:50,000 base map. This gives the following total number of properties by assembly constituency \nArfon 235 and Dwyfor Meirionnydd 332, giving proportions of 0.4145 and 0.5855 respectively. No \ncommunal establishments have been identified within this LSOA, and so therefore it is assumed that the \nage structure between the two parts of W01000086 will be similar. \n1-b The population density has been calculated from mid-2004 population estimates (see note 1-a), and area \nmeasurements compiled from Census 2001 statistics (see note 1-d). Area measurements are based on \nthe 2001 version of the Ordnance Survey Boundary-Line data-set, amended where district boundaries \nhave changed since 2001, and do not include inland water. \n1-c Working age is 16-64 for males, 16-59 for females, and retirement age is 65+ for males, 60+ for females. \n1-d These statistics have been aggregated from Census 2001 Key Statistics for electoral divisions, using \nSASPAC (software specifically written for the analysis and interrogation of datasets derived from the \nCensus of Population).  \nIn general, there may be occasional small discrepancies between counts or percentages shown in \nCensus tables from different sources. This is usually because cells in Census tables are randomly \nadjusted to avoid the release of confidential data.  \nGeneral details on the Census can be found on the first website below, and the second link is to the \n'Census 2001 Definitions' which includes a glossary of terms: \nwww.statistics.gov.uk/census\nwww.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/definitions_chapters_1_5.pdf\n1-e A 'communal establishment' is defined as an establishment providing managed residential \naccommodation, where 'managed' means full-time or part-time supervision of the accommodation. \n1-f ‘Non-white ethnic group’ includes people from a mixed white-other ethnic group. \n1-g A 'migrant' is a person with a different address one year before the Census to that on census day.  \n1-h The EU is as defined on Census day (29 April 2001). \n1-i 'One or more skills in Welsh' means speaks, reads, writes and/or understands Welsh. \n1-j 'Identified as Welsh' means those who have written 'Welsh' or 'Cymraeg' or similar in one or more of the \nwrite-in boxes in the ethnic group question. \n1-k StatsWales (table 003462) \nhttp://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=3462\nThe number of people who were registered on the electoral roll and were therefore entitled to vote, as at \n1 December 2006. It is based on the qualifying date of 15 October 2006. If there had been an election on \n1 December 2006 then those who registered after 15 October would not be eligible to vote. Note that \nentitlement to vote is different for Assembly and Parliamentary elections. EU citizens resident in Wales \nare entitled to vote at National Assembly for Wales (and local government elections) but not at \nParliamentary elections. \n10   \nMembers’ Research Service: Research Paper \nGwasanaeth Ymchwil yr Aelodau: Papur Ymchwil \n \n  \nTable 1: Population statistics (continued) \n1-l ONS, UK Electoral Statistics 2006 (Table 2b) \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9566&More=Y\nThis table is derived from data supplied to the ONS by Electoral Registration Officers and shows the \nnumber of people who on 1 December 2006 were registered to vote in parliamentary elections in the UK. \nThe latest Electoral Register came into effect and is based on a qualifying date of 15 October 2006. The \ntotal number of parliamentary electors is residential qualifiers which includes overseas electors. Overseas \nelectors are not resident in the United Kingdom, but must previously have been resident here and \nincluded in the electoral register (unless they were too young to register). They are registered in the same \nparliamentary constituency as before they went abroad. The residence qualification requires a person to \nbe normally living at the address on the qualifying date even if temporarily absent. People having more \nthan one place of residence, such as students, may therefore be included on more than one register, but \nthey are only entitled to vote in one constituency in a general election. \nTable 2: Economic and Labour Market Statistics \n2-a See note 1-d. \n2-b These statistics were provided by the Statistical Directorate of the Welsh Assembly Government, and use \ninformation from the ONS's Annual Labour Force Survey / Annual Population Survey for the year to 30 \nJune 2006. Statistics for electoral areas have been aggregated from estimates for Output Areas. \nThey show rates of working age people 'in employment' and 'economically inactive (excluding students)'. \nRates of unemployment are not shown due to the small sample sizes involved (at constituency level), and \nsince alternative statistics on Job-Seekers' Allowance claimants are provided. \nFurther information on the data source is provided on the following webpage: \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=11711&More=Y\n2-c These statistics were provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Data for electoral areas \nwere aggregated using data for electoral divisions from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. \nCounts of claimants or beneficiaries for August 2006 were provided (rounded to the nearest ten), and \nrates have been derived using the population estimates described in note 1-d, unless otherwise stated. \nSee the following website for further information on statistics produced by the DWP: \nwww.dwp.gov.uk/asd\n2-d Includes those receiving Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance. Incapacity Benefit is paid \nto people who are assessed as being incapable of work and who meet certain contribution conditions. \nUntil April 2001, people who were incapable of work and did not satisfy the contribution conditions for \nIncapacity Benefit could get Severe Disablement Allowance. \n2-e Disability Living Allowance is a tax-free benefit for children and adults (under 65) who need help with \npersonal care or have walking difficulties because they are physically or mentally disabled. \n2-f Income Support is intended to help people on low incomes who do not have to be available for \nemployment. The main types of people who receive it are lone parents, the long and short-term sick, \npeople with disabilities and other special groups. Rates are calculated using Census 2001 estimates of \nnumbers of households (see note 1-d). \n2-g Pension Credit is designed to help pensioners at the lower end of the income scale by ensuring a \nguaranteed minimum weekly income (guaranteed credit) and, in addition, to reward those people who \nhave made modest provision for their retirement (savings credit). Pension Credit is claimed on a \nhousehold basis and therefore the number of people that Pension Credit helps ('beneficiaries') is the \nnumber of claimants in addition to the number of partners for whom they are also claiming. \n11   \nMembers’ Research Service: Research Paper \nGwasanaeth Ymchwil yr Aelodau: Papur Ymchwil \n \n  \nTable 3: Education Statistics \n3-a See note 1-d.

          "DRAFT FINAL REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENTSF/GT/0026/08 \n           \nExplanatory Memorandum to the Honey (Amendment) (Wales) \nRegulations 2008 \n \nThis Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared by the Food Standards \nAgency Wales and is laid before the National Assembly for Wales in \naccordance with Standing Order 24.1. \n \nDescription \n \nThese Regulations implement an EC Corrigendum of 21 February 2007.  The \nCorrigendum corrects an error found in Commission Directive 2001/110/EC \nwhich lays down European compositional standards with which a product \nmust comply in order to be described as ‘honey’; and provides additional \nlabelling requirements for these products.  The Directive was implemented in \nWales by the Honey (Wales) Regulations 2003. \n \nMatters of special interest to the Subordinate Legislation Committee \n \nNone. \nLegislative Background \nThe powers enabling the Regulations to be made are contained in Sections \n16(1) (e) 17(1), 26(1) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act. These are \nexercisable by Welsh Ministers.  The Regulations are subject to the \nAssembly’s negative resolution procedure. \nPurpose and Intended effect of the legislation \n \nCommission Directive 2001/110/EC lays down European compositional \nstandards with which a product must comply in order to be described as \n‘honey’ and details labelling requirements for these products.  Commission \nDirective 2001/110/EC was transposed in Wales by virtue of The Honey \n(Wales) Regulations 2003.  An error in this Directive was identified by officials \nprior to the Regulations for England and Scotland being made and corrected \nby the time their Regulations came into force.  The FSA advised the \nCommission of the error resulting in the publication of EC Corrigendum of 21 \nFebruary 2007.  Neither FSA Wales nor FSA NI was aware of this error prior \nto making the Honey Regulations in their respective countries.  The proposed \namending Regulations will correct this error in Wales.  Failure to implement \nthis amendment would result in an inconsistency in UK Law. \nThe proposed amending Regulations will; \n \n 1SF/GT/0026/08 \n• Change ‘not more than 0.8mS/cm’ to ‘not less than 0.8mS/cm’ against \n‘honeydew and chestnut honey and blends of these except with those \n1\nlist below’ (Annex II; Item 4 Electrical conductivityTPF FPT). \n \nImplementation \n \nIt is intended that these regulations will come into force on 24 March 2008.  \nThe parallel Northern Ireland Regulations will come into force slightly later. \n \nConsultation \n \nThese amending Regulations do not impose any new legal requirements.  A \nfull 12 week public consultation was therefore not conducted.  Interested \nparties including industry, enforcement and consumer representatives were \ninformed of the change by way of an Interested Parties letter and allowed four \nweeks in which to raise any issues or comments. \nNo responses to the letter were received.    \n \nNo policy changes to the draft Regulations were identified as a consequence \nof the public consultation. \n \nRegulatory Impact Assessment \n \nIt has not been deemed necessary to complete a Regulatory Impact \nAssessment in this instance given that these Regulations do not impose any \nnew legal requirement and have no impact on Industry, enforcement or \nconsumers.     \n \n                                            \n1\nTP PT Conductivity is a good criterion of the botanical origin of honey and today it \nis determined in routine honey control instead of the ash content. This \nmeasurement depends on the ash and acid content of honey; the higher their \ncontent, the higher the resulting conductivity. \n 2\n",

          "I Beatrice.  The Novel as Blog; an Online Experiment: The day of the ball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Beatrice.  The Novel as Blog; an Online Experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to an historic house when it remains in private hands rather than in  those of the National Trust? That was the starting point for my story. The people gravitating round it, each one jostling for the best position from which to get possession of it in the end.... the people came later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, 29 November 2007\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the ball\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the ball began before dawn, with Belle coming into my room with stricken face at four o’clock (I having spent that night at the Macauley house), to tell me that her mother had ‘had some kind of turn’: had cried out her husband’s name in her sleep; had then wakened, insisted upon dressing  fully - and was at present emptying all the drawers in her bedroom in frantic search of an old photograph that she said Jack had used to carry his wallet.\n\n\n\n“She’s quite beside herself!” Belle urgently whispered, as I struggled to try to remember where I was, and what was happening. “She knows it’s somewhere; she put it somewhere very carefully herself, years ago – and now she must find it, or the ball can’t go ahead, the Orangery will have to be dismantled, and everything will be ruined!”\n\n\n\nIt took me several moments, but I was finally able to bring to mind that old story: the one about the young Jack Macauley, and the girl called Milly, whom he had worshipped from afar in the days when he was still an awkward grocer’s boy, ashamed of his clumsy  boots.  I struggled to recall the detail of it; how Jack Macauley had carried an old newspaper photograph of Milly in his wallet for years afterwards; and how Theodora, as his young bride, had stumbled on it, never admitting the fact to him, but remaining haunted by it, at intervals, ever since. I had assumed it must have gone away, years ago; yet here was Belle now, in deep distress, bringing it sharply back into the present, and leaving me wondering what on earth there was that I could usefully  say.\n\n\n\n“And does it still exist, do you think...?” was the best I could manage, in my still only half-awake state. But “Oh good heavens, no!” Belle exclaimed in reply. “Daddy himself destroyed it years ago. He had gone looking for Milly you see, years afterwards. He had happened to be on business in the area, and he looked her up. Not because he still had feelings for her, but just because he needed to lay that particular ghost.  It was idiocy on the part of a grown man, he said, to carry about with him the image of a girl he had once supposed he loved!  But he found her grown fat and frumpy anyway! A silly, garrulous woman; not a trace left of that disdainful girl who had stalked his dreams!  So that there was no longer the smallest need to keep her picture, and he tore it up. I remember how he laughed at his own foolishness, and said that there was no need to trouble Mummy about it.” \n\n\n\n“But did you never tell her this yourself?” was my next, rather inadequate offering. To which Belle replied that no, she never had: supposing, mistakenly as it now turned out, that it would be better if her mother didn’t know that Jack had gone off in search of  his long- lost  Milly. \n\n\n\n“Well, I think you probably ought to tell her now” I suggested.  “How else, after all, can you possibly put her mind at rest?”\n\n\n\nBill was up now; had come stumbling into my room to know what the rumpus was; and being apprised of the state of things, agreed with my suggestion; so that together we went to Lady Macauley, and calming  her as best we could, put the whole story before her. She listened in silence, unable at first to believe we weren’t making the whole thing up. We were trying to humour a silly old woman, she cried: it was quite the cruellest form of deception!  But then she suddenly seemed to think that, yes, that would be just the way it would have been likely to happen!  Jack would have felt himself bound to act - and in acting, would have found the truth.  The effect was near miraculous. Her face, which had been contorted with grief the moment before, relaxed suddenly; she uttered the longest sigh, and said simply “Oh, thank God then -  it was me he loved after all!”\n\n\n\nWe said all the things that people do say, in such situations.  We said that of course he had loved her – only her. How could he not have loved her, when she was everything that Milly had been, and a thousand better things as well! \n\n \n\n“He adored you Mummy, as you well know” Belle ended by assuring her.  “No woman was ever adored as you were – he thought you just the most beautiful, most perfect woman in the world.  And I at least know for sure that he never gave Milly another thought, from that day on.”\n\n\n\nIt was enough. We could start the day of the ball now; and we started it with a cheerful breakfast of coffee and toast, taken there together in Lady Macauley’s room, while a cold grey dawn slipped in through the slats of the window blinds.  We three remained troubled though, by Lady Macauley’s earlier collapse; and Bill at least, was all for calling a doctor – just to make perfectly sure that all was well.  But Lady Macauley insisted that no such thing was necessary; she would not hear of it, was perfectly well and calm -  and we should see what she was able to accomplish during the course of this day, before the ball began.\n\n\n\nWhat she accomplished was indeed remarkable.  She had another long list of people with whom she wished to talk; beginning with Will, alone, at nine o’clock, and progressing, at intervals during the morning, with Jack and Alice, with the Baineses, with Imogen – and even with Frances and Tomek, whom she summoned last; wishing, she said, to thank them for the part they had played in bringing matters to a head, and to entreat them to come to the ball. She spent an hour with Frances and Tomek, in fact – and Frances herself emerged at the end of it quite flushed with happiness, at the hand of friendship that had been extended to her at last..\n\n \n\nLady Macauley would have liked too, to talk with Mrs Wilmot and her daughter. She had become reconciled to them at last, she said.  Oh, not that she saw the girl as a contender for Will’s hand – never that!  But simply that she saw their part in all this as suddenly rather heroic.\n\n\n\n“She stood her ground against all the odds, poor woman!” she observed, of the formerly impossible Mrs Avril Wilmot. “It can’t have been easy for her, received with hostility as she was, on all sides.  She must know by now besides, that she too has been the dupe of Rose’s nasty little plot.  I want to let her know that I understand that – and that I respect her courage, at least...  But perhaps after all it will do better to wait for the ball – when I shall be able to single her out, choose her over Rose, you know, and let her down as gently as I can. Will must speak to her of course - I have told him that.  He has created this mess and now he must extricate himself from it.  Together, we shall enable that unfortunate woman and her daughter to make their exit with dignity intact  - and Rose shall see that every plan of hers has gone hideously awry!”\n\n\n\nWe wished her to rest then, and she said she would.  Just as soon as she had made her last inspection of the Orangery, and seen for herself that everything was just as perfect as it could be for the events that were to unfold.  She had earlier dispensed with the idea of a separate venue for youthful dancing. No marquee had after all been erected - the young must make shift with the old, she had decided: there were not so many of them after all -  she just hoped that some at least of them, would have learnt how to waltz!   We went then in solemn procession to the Orangery, where darkness had wrought a  magical effect. Everything was beautifully in its place: the instruments for the orchestra stood covered on a dais at the top of the larger of the two adjoining rooms; the new floor sparkled, with the thousand reflected lights -  and all the little gilded chairs and tables, the flowers, the scented stillness of the air itself,  seemed poised and waiting, for the night’s events to begin...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nI Beatrice\n\n\nat\n10:53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\ncomments:\n        \n\n\n\t\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\n\t\nI am glad Lady M found out that Milly is now fat and garrulous.

It would have been a bit foolish, coming after....\n\nBut what of my having been read in Farsi?  I'm staggered - it's a language I'm not sure I've even heard of!  How is it achieved I wonder - since it must be done instantaneously, at one click of the mouse, so to speak!\n\n\n\t\n\n\n29 November 2007 12:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nmerry weather\nsaid...\n\n\t\nExciting - wish I was going to this ball Bea, still the way you tell it I feel I'm almost there...\n\nSo Milly was an illusion after all, ah, it's a shame Jack didn't tell her himself; but I don't suppose he would have brought the subject up would he? \n\nI'm glad Lady M is making peace with her fellows, that seems right, and especially with the brave Avril Wilmot whom I've grown quite attached to really :)\n\n\n\t\n\n\n29 November 2007 15:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\naims\nsaid...\n\n\t\nHow I wish I had been asked to the ball..the lights - the smells...a romantic can only dream of these things most of the time...\n\nLady M - she is an excellent character that you have excelled at portraying....\n\nI await the ball almost impatiently - wishing I could at least stand back in the drapery and watch the events unfold..\n\n\n\t\n\n\n29 November 2007 18:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nI Beatrice\nsaid...\n\n\t\nThank you Merry - and yes, I have grown quite attached to the Wilmots too.  A pity really, that I haven't had time or space to develop them....\n\nThere's a kind of virtual sub-category attached to this blog of mine, in fact.  It's called   \"Undeveloped characters for possible consideration later\".\nOne of it's chief inhabitants is Cousin Hortense, who popped-up all uninvited one day - but with whom I'd have liked to be able to 'let rip' at some point. But somehow there just hasn't been time or opportunity\n\nStill, there'll be all the time in the world, AFTER, won't there?  So who knows what I might not find it in me to do?\n\n\n\t\n\n\n30 November 2007 08:07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nI Beatrice\nsaid...\n\n\t\nI formally invite you to the ball now, Aims.

That old story was crucial to the thing really (slight shades of \"there were three of us in that marriage\" perhaps?).  And in the end I just couldn't squeeze it into the episode of the ball.\n\nYou have been very patient - but yes, please do put on your ball-gown and come along!

Glad that Lady M can lay that one to rest.  Sounds as though Lady M is going through some sort of finalising process, though.\n\nSo, the suspense continues, the scene is set!  I wish I could go to the ball too.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n02 December 2007 13:22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nI Beatrice\nsaid...\n\n\t\nYou too SHALL go to the ball Marianne!  Just as soon as I have got it going. It's the oddest thing, but this one instalment is giving me more trouble than all the rest of them put together.\n\nPerhaps I just don't want to let go?\n\n\n\t\n\n\n03 December 2007 08:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Post\n\n\nOlder Post\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Characters\n\n\nClick here for the list of characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me\n\n\n\tI Beatrice\n\tThe working title of the novel is MACAULEY'S HOUSE - though Jack Macauley himself has been dead for more than twenty years when the story opens. Here is an extract from the early pages:\n\n\n\" ... The big gaunt old mansion they call Macauley's house had already stood for more than three hundred years by the time Jack Macauley came along. His was very much a twentieth century connection: he came there late in the house's life and stayed but briefly, so that his having given his name to it can only be seen to be one of those curious accidents of history for which there is no real accounting. Ask any of the older locals about Jack Macauley today however, and you will see them smile. Those at least of them who don't scowl, and tell you that the man was an upstart, who brought nothing but disgrace and scandal to the village.  The old house still bears his name, for all that. Which makes people ask themselves sometimes if after all it isn't the meek, but the disgraceful - the upstarts and scandal-makers - who most of all inherit the earth; or who are at any rate remembered longest when everything else has gone...\"\n\n\nView my complete profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog Archive\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n▼ \n\n2007\n(73)\n\t\n\n▼ \n\n12/30 - 01/06\n(1)\n\tEnd Piece\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n              ►\n            \n\n\n12/16 - 12/23\n(1)\n\tJust in Passing....\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n              ►\n            \n\n\n12/09 - 12/16\n(3)\n\tWhen the music stopped\n\tAt the ball;
