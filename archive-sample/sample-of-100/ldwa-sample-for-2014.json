In response to this global issue, over 100 organisations came together to launch a campaign, Enough Food For Everyone If, on January 23. The campaign, the largest coalition of its kind in the UK since Make Poverty History in 2005, aims to call on Prime Minister, David Cameron, to use his presidency to bring these concerns to the top of the agenda at the upcoming G8 summit.\nIslamic Relief, a member of the coalition, supports the aims and its UK Director, Jehangir Malik, said, âIslamic Relief wants to encourage Muslims and mosques throughout the UK to get involved in this campaign with us.â\nThe Campaign wants leaders to act on four key âifsâ that could help alleviate hunger for millions of people around the world. The first aim states that there will be enough food for everyone if we give enough aid to stop children dying from hunger and help the poorest families feed themselves. This includes rich nations putting more life-saving aid into sustainable small-scale agriculture and nutrition, in order to build upon the agreement made at the 2012 G8 summit filling the gap in agriculture funding, and reaching the $5 billion needed to pay for action on nutrition would collectively save more than 1 million lives every year.\nThe second aim points out that there would be enough food for everyone if governments stop big companies dodging tax in poor countries. If large companies stopped avoiding tax in developing countries, the national food scheme could reach more people. Under this aim the coalition aims to encourage the G8 to launch a âConvention on Tax Transparencyâ ensuring countries would commit to preventing individuals and companies from hiding wealth so that itâs untraceable, tax havens would be required to share with developing countries any important information on hidden wealth and assets, and developing countries would receive assistance in recovering taxes due to them.\nThe final aim is transparency â there would be enough food for everyone if governments and big companies are honest and open about their actions that stop people getting enough food.\nThe aim states that governments and big companies would rather we didnât know the deals they make to help keep the worldâs poorest citizens in a cycle of hunger, and now is the time for them to be held account. It requests stronger laws are needed that force governments and corporations to be open and honest in all their actions relating to the food system, and ensure that resources are used to help poor people.\nIt calls for the G8 to push for greater transparency in land acquisitions, financial transparency and corporate transparency, to ensure that corrupt deals are stopped.\nÃ\nComments are closed.\nnext\nprev\nSectarianism in the Middle East and its rise in the UK, Standpoint, Sahar TV.

Chevrolet's Orlando isn't a particularly innovative seven seater mini-MPV but its keen pricing and chunky styling will endear it to many.\nBackground\nOkay, so the Chevrolet Orlando could only sound more like a US holiday rental if they dubbed it the Hertz or the Avis. But set that thought aside, approach the Orlando with an open mind and you'll appreciate that this is a significant and promising vehicle. It's no great secret that until fairly recently Chevrolet was on its knees, and it would be understandable if the products it was bringing to market were cheaply developed and hastily conceived. That doesn't appear to be the case with the Orlando. Yes, it rides on much the same General Motors Delta chassis as the Vauxhall Astra but anyone who has driven the latest Astra will mark that as a positive.\nThere has long been a requirement among cash-strapped parents for cost-effective, safe family transport. Until recently, that niche was filled by the Citroen Xsara Picasso, but since that car was pensioned off, nothing has stepped forward to fill the slot. The Orlando is staking its claim to that piece of automotive real estate.\nDriving Experience\nAs befits its role as a cost-effective people mover, the Orlando doesn't pack anything too exciting under its stubby bonnet. There's a 139bhp 1.8-litre petrol engine which will attract heavy discounting and allow Chevrolet to post an eye-catching price tag in their ads, and then there are the engines that most UK buyers will want. These comprise a pair of diesels, both of two-litre capacity, producing either 139 or 161bhp. The 1.8 petrol is a fairly inoffensive unit but it's worth remembering that it's got a lot of bulk to haul here and it lacks the torque to pull a typically laden Orlando with any sparkle.\nThe diesels are a far wiser choice and they're even acceptably refined. The driving position is acceptable with plenty of adjustment, although the chunky rear pillars and tapered side windows mean that rear three-quarter visibility isn't the best. If you're worried about this, best to specify the reverse parking sensors to help you navigate into tight parking spots. At 4470mm long, the Orlando is a mere 3mm longer than a Vauxhall Zafira, and is exactly as long as a Citroen C4 Picasso, so it's fairly easy to get a handle on the size of vehicle you would be edging into a parking bay.\nDesign and Build\nThe received wisdom is that any mini-MPV stands or falls by the quality of its seating layout. To this end we've seen all manner of ingenuity, with seats springing from all sorts of orifices but there's only so much you can do with a given wheelbase and the Orlando copies the homework of the current cleverest in class, the Vauxhall Zafira. While it's never going to win any prizes for originality, the Orlando's five seats plus two that pop out of the boot floor work very well. Yes, the rear seats look like something erected from an IKEA flat pack at first, but they're extremely sturdy. With an additional 85mm in the wheelbase compared to an Astra, there's plenty of legroom in the first two rows but the final pair of seats are, as usual, best left for smaller children. In all there are 30 seating combinations and a rear seat mirror will allow you to keep an eye on the kids.\nChevrolet says that in spite of the sweeping roof-line, the designers have succeeded in raising the second and third row of seats, which means Orlando's rear occupants get an even better view forwards. What this really means is that the fuel tank has to be packaged somewhere and, like most MPVs, it's safely positioned under the passenger seats. There are storage compartments situated in the centre console, front and rear doors, rear luggage area and in the roof. There's even a stowage space concealed behind front fascia of the audio system, and its big enough to house your iPod or wallet. There's also a USB port in there for charging on the fly. Maximum luggage space is impressive with the rear seats folded, but there's some intrusion from the rear wheel arches.\nMarket and Model\nSomewhat strangely for a car called an Orlando and built in the US, this Chevy isn't sold in the States and is designed with a European audience in mind. It's built like a European rather than an American product too, with decent materials, tight shutlines and no significant acreage of elephant-grey plastic. As with all Chevrolet models, equipment levels are strong for the money.\nThe fascia design is reminiscent of the latest Ford models, with a bullhorn centre console in this case topped by an LCD display that houses a rear view camera in upper specification models. The layout of the minor controls will be familiar to Vauxhall Astra drivers and the only slightly jarring material choice is the automatic gearshift gate. Otherwise the dashboard is smartly finished and the multi-function steering wheel makes operating the stereo simplicity itself.\nCustomers will also be able to choose from four trim levels in the UK with standard equipment on all cars including electronic stability control, six air-bags, air conditioning and electrically heated and adjustable door mirrors.\nCost of Ownership\nIf you're at all interested in economy, it's worth avoiding the 1.8-litre petrol. Yes, you could fire up Excel, calculate the upfront savings and then figure out your annual mileage and the break even point when the diesel model would be a more cost-effective buy but don't bother. The reason why is that you won't achieve anything like the published economy figures in the petrol-engined car, and that's because you'll need to thrash it mercilessly to get anywhere. It just lacks the torque to make driving relaxing and family driving needs all the help it can get when it comes to stress relief.\nFar better to target one of the two diesels. If you do, you'll be rewarded with beefier residual values and cheaper road tax to boot. The entry-level diesel model returns an excellent 58.7mpg and, depending on trim choice, should emit around 130g/km of carbon dioxide.\nSummary\nChevrolet has had a rather hit and miss record in its attempt to assimilate itself into the European market. That said, it's hard to see how the Orlando can possibly fail. Not only is it great value for money, but it also has a distinct personality of its own. Quality is better than you might expect and, as long as you choose a diesel engine, ongoing running costs are encouragingly modest. It goes without saying that it's a practical thing but the amount of care that has gone into making this car easy to live with on a day-to-day basis is obvious.\nIt's undeniably good looking to boot, with its bluff front end, low-rider roofline and chamfered edges. Couple that with Chevrolet's strong warranty and plenty of safety kit and you have a package that family buyers looking for something a bit more covetable than the usual mini-MPV distress purchase will warm to.\nUsed Car Search\nin association with\nPostcode:\nPlease enter a Postcode\nMake:\nAlfa\nAlfa Romeo\nAston Martin\nAudi\nBentley\nBMW\nCadillac\nCaterham\nChevrolet\nChrysler\nCitroen\nDaewoo\nDaihatsu\nDodge\nFerrari\nFiat\nFord\nHonda\nHummer\nHyundai\nInfiniti\nIsuzu\nJaguar\nJeep\nKia\nLada\nLamborghini\nLancia\nLand Rover\nLexus\nLotus\nMaserati\nMaybach\nMazda\nMercedes-Benz\nMG\nMINI\nMitsubishi\nMorgan\nNissan\nNoble\nPerodua\nPeugeot\nPorsche\nProton\nRenault\nRolls-Royce\nRover\nSaab\nSEAT\nSkoda\nSmart\nSsangYong\nSubaru\nSuzuki\nToyota\nTVR\nVauxhall\nVolkswagen\nVolvo\nModel:\nLatest News\nThe all-new MINI Paceman\nBMW take more fleet awards\nHyundai HND-9 revealed\nSee more News\nÂ \nDerbyshire Times Recommends\nBack to the top of the page\nNews\nSport\nWhat's On\nWeather\nPlace your Ad\nSubscribe\nSpecial Features\nDeals\nShop\nHolidays\nDating\nBingo\nBuy a Photo\nLocal news on the move\nKeep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.\nVisit this website on your mobile to start enjoying it on the move.\nSubscribe to the Derbyshire Times\nGet your favourite newspaper at a great low price.\nCall us on 0844 292 0216 or click here\nto start your subscription today!\nNewsletter sign up\nNewsletter sign up\nContact us\nIf you wish, you can contact us using any of the methods below.\nSpire Walk, off Derby Road\nChesterfield\nEngland\nDerbyshire\nS40 2WG\nEmail: comment@derbyshiretimes.co.uk\nTelephone: 01246 504500\nFAQs\nTerms and Conditions\nDisclaimer\nCookies Policy\nSwitch to Mobile Site\nAll rights reserved\nÂ© 2014 Johnston Publishing Ltd.\nThis website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissionâs Code of Practice.

OP Consultation\nOutstanding item on personal alarms.\nAK stated that where the alarm system is integrated into the building it\ncan be charged for, whether a client uses it not, but if it isnât used then\nthe charges would form part of the general maintenance charges.\nApparently the DWP (Housing benefit) are not necessarily classing\nthese types of costs as HB eligible.

Vanessa C confirmed she had had her meeting with\nthe HCA before Christmas to see if there was any more money\navailable.\nThe conclusions from this meeting indicated that any Bedford based\norganisations were better off trying to get funding through normal\nprograms. Vanessa C confirmed that funding was always over\nsubscribed and that Bedford had not done well with allocations.\nUNCLASSIFIED Internal Only\nPage 3 of 6\nUNCLASSIFIED Internal Only\nVanessa C will be attending a meeting on the 28th Jan to talk about\nnew funding programs for Bedford, she invited all providers present to\nattend if they would like to.\nVanessa C confirmed that BCHA had started work on site at Charter\nHouse. The first phase is to build a new care home to move residents\ninto and then demolish the existing home and build an extra care\nscheme on the site.\n5. OP Consultation\nLS reported on the feedback received from phase II of the\nconsultation.\nFewer responses were received in the second round than in the first,\nbut this was expected as the proposals for Phase 2 meant that most\nschemes would experience very little change.\nDifferent questions were asked across different services, with the\nfocus divided between - sheltered housing/extra care with on site\nsupport and - visiting support with unused hours being offered in the\ncommunity with the option of opting out of the support if not needed.\nPlease see the attached report for the detailed feedback.\nLS asked if there were any thoughts or questions.\nAK thanked the clients present for their continued attendance at this\nmeeting and all clients for giving the SP Team their time in meeting us\nand responding to the questionnaires for this consultation.\nVivienne C commented that it was nice that the SP team went out and\nactually took the time to meet people and acknowledged the need to\nexplain the consultation face to face.\nAP did mention that there was some confusion for BCHA residents as\na couple of the consultation visits coincided with Contract Monitoring\nvisits. This was taken on board although the timings for the SP team\nwere difficult.\nLS confirmed a few residents asked directly for feedback, however we\nwould like to provide feedback for everyone. LS suggested that she\nput a summary report together for all providers to circulate to their\nclients or put in communal areas. Action LS\nAK confirmed that now the consultation period was over the proposals\nneed to be approved by the council. The approval process had started\nand he would expect approval sometime in March.\nLS\n6. New Developments updates\nBCHA\nVanessa C reported the ongoing works at Charter House were going\nwell.\nUNCLASSIFIED Internal Only\nPage 4 of 6\nUNCLASSIFIED Internal Only\nAlso that the site plans for Maydenbury were under consideration and\nthat the intention was to look at developing this site as some form of\nextra care.\nBPHA\nLT reported that the redevelopment work had commenced at\nTavistock Court. The work was part of a dementia project being\ndelivered in partnership with Bedford Borough Council, BPHA, Dame\nAlice, Health, and Rempods.\nThe idea behind Rempods is to make a more stimulating and tactile\nenvironment for the residents. This company specialises in providing\nold items (e.g. ration books), creating zones using colours, introducing\npictures and old TVâs playing old films to stimulate conversation and\ninteraction among residents.\nThe effects of these changes will be monitored in the hope that they\nwill have positive results on residents.\nLT also reported that there is the possibility of developing their\nWootton scheme as an extra care scheme.\nOrbit\nAK stated that St Bedes is taking in tenants despite the ongoing\nbuilding work. If anyone would like to arrange a visit he advised that\nthey approach the Sales Office on site.\nVanessa C asked about nominating clients, AK recommended that the\non site manager at St Bedes be contacted.

The response was cautious\nas at present there still seems to be a\nstrong demand for bedsits in some\nschemes.\nVanessa C requested that the disparity between the two objectives be\nclarified and the objectives possibly rewritten.\nâ¢ Identify suitable sites for the development of 200 sheltered\nhousing/ assisted living units for sale and\nâ¢ Review the existing conventional sheltered housing stock for\nrent with landlords to identify potential schemes for\ndecommissioning, or upgrading\n8.

Brace yourself for a plethora of un-PC laughs.\nMarvel continue their epic rise by following up comic-book hero Thor's big screen debut with one of their most iconic characters: Captain America: The First Avenger.\nSet during the Second World War, Chris Evans' shield-throwing super-solider will be trying to crush the Red Skull and his henchmen on July 29 against a myriad of period set-pieces.\nBeing the final film before the anticipated comic mash-up The Avengers in 2012 (where the Cap' will be teaming up with Iron Man, The Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor) all eyes are on director Joe Dante to continue the quality.\nA smorgasbord of sequels, reimaginings and remakes are set for the season, but there will still be the occasional original film to keep things fresh.\nTipped to be one of Summer's highlights is JJ Abrams' Super 8, which captures the adventure spirit of Spielberg-esque story-telling when a group of small-town kids witness a devastating train crash which unleashes a deadly cargo.\nAnd Daniel Craig will be teaming up with Harrison Ford on August 19 in Jon Favreau's sci-fi-western Cowboys & Aliens, which promises a gaggle of kinetic special effects and extra-terrestrial encounters.\nWith plenty more to enjoy over the holidays when the sun refuses to shine including live-action adventure with The Smurfs (August 10), prequel Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (August 12), sword-and-sandles fantasy remake Conan The Barbarian (August 26), and revamp of 80s horror flick Fright Night (September 2); there will be no shortage of celluloid fun to be had at the movies.\nÂ \nPrint article\nWrite a comment\nView comments\nYou must be a registered user to leave a comment.

So great, in fact, that it not only reflects and plays with philosophical ideas, it actually does real philosophy, and does it well.\nHow can a comic cartoon do this? Precisely because it is a comic cartoon, the form best suited to illuminate our age.\nTo speak truthfully and insightfully today you must have a sense of the absurdity of human life and endeavour. Past attempts to construct grand and noble theories about human history and destiny have collapsed.\nWe now know we're just a bunch of naked apes trying to get on as best we can, usually messing things up, but somehow finding life can be sweet all the same. All delusions of a significance that we do not really have need to be stripped away, and nothing can do this better that the great deflater: comedy.\nThe satirical cartoon world is essentially a philosophical one because it reflects reality by abstracting it, distilling it and presenting it back to us, illuminating it more brightly than realist fiction can\nThe Simpsons does this brilliantly, especially when it comes to religion. It's not that the Simpsons is atheist propaganda; its main target is not belief in God or the supernatural, but the arrogance of particular organised religions that they, amazingly, know the will of the creator.\nFor example, in the episode Homer the Heretic, Homer gives up church and decides to follow God in his own way: by watching the TV, slobbing about and dancing in his underpants.\nThroughout the episode he justifies himself in a number of ways.\n\"What's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday, I mean, isn't God everywhere?\"\n\"Don't you think the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?\"\n\"And what if we've picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder?\"\nHomer's protests do not merely allude to much subtler arguments that proper philosophers make. The basic points really are that simple, which is why they can be stated simply.\nPhilosophy's First Family\nOf course, there is more that can and should be said about them, but when we make decisions about whether or not to follow one particular religion, the reasons that really matter to us are closer to the simple truths of the Simpsons than the complex mental machinations of academic philosophers of religion.\nAnd that's true even for the philosophers, whose high-level arguments are virtuosi feats of reasoning, but are not the things that win hearts and minds. They are merely the lengthy guitar solos to Homer's crushing, compelling riffs.\nHowever, being simple is not the same as being simplistic, which is one of the greatest crimes in the Simpsons' universe.\nWe can see this when Homer's house catches fire, in what could be seen as divine retribution for his apostasy.\nBut what actually led to the fire was not God's wrath but Homer's hubris and arrogance. Sitting on his sofa thinking smugly, \"Boy, everyone is stupid except me,\" he falls asleep, dropping his cigar.\nWhat really caused the fire was thus a slippage from the simple into the simplistic. Homer's mistake was to think that because the key points which inform his heresy are simple, that the debate is closed and he has nothing left to learn from others. But this is being simplistic, not keeping things simple.\nSmall dots, big picture\nRevealing simple truths about simplistic falsehoods is not just a minor philosophical task, like doing the washing up at Descartes' Diner while the real geniuses cook up the main courses.\nFor when it comes to the relevance of philosophy to real life, all the commitments we make on the big issues are determined by considerations which are ultimately quite straightforward.\nPointillist paintings, such as this by Seurat, use thousands of tiny dots\nA rich philosophical worldview is in this sense like a pointillist picture - one of those pieces of art in which a big image is made up of thousands of tiny dots (see Seurat image, right). Its building blocks are no more than simple dots, but the overall picture which builds up from this is much more complicated.\nYet we need reminding that the dots are just dots, and that errors are made more often not by those who fail to examine the dots carefully enough, but those who become fixated by the brilliance or defects of one or two and who fail to see how they fit into the big picture.\nAnd the Simpsons certainly plays out on a broad canvas.\nAny individual or group is shown to be ridiculous when only their pathetic and partial view of the world is taken to be everything. That's why no one escapes satire in the programme, which is vital for its ultimately uplifting message: we're an absurd species but together we make for a wonderful world.\nThe Simpsons, like Monty Python, is an Anglo-Saxon comedic take on the existentialism which in France takes on a more tragic hue. Albert Camus' absurd is defied not by will, but mocking laughter.\nAbstract themes\nAnother reason why cartoons are the best form in which to do philosophy is that they are non-realistic in the same way that philosophy is.\nTrue heir to Plato, Simpsons creator Matt Groening\nPhilosophy needs to be real in the sense that it has to make sense of the world as it is, not as we imagine or want it to be. But philosophy deals with issues on a general level. It is concerned with a whole series of grand abstract nouns: truth, justice, the good, identity, consciousness, mind, meaning and so on.\nCartoons abstract from real life in much the same way philosophers do. Homer is not realistic in the way a film or novel character is, but he is recognisable as a kind of American Everyman. His reality is the reality of an abstraction from real life that captures its essence, not as a real particular human who we see ourselves reflected in.\nThe satirical cartoon world is essentially a philosophical one because to work it needs to reflect reality accurately by abstracting it, distilling it and then presenting it back to us, illuminating it more brightly than realist fiction can.\nThat's why it is no coincidence that the most insightful and philosophical cultural product of our time is a comic cartoon, and why its creator, Matt Groening, is the true heir of Plato, Aristotle and Kant.\nJulian Baggini is talking about the philosophy of The Simpsons at The Watershed, Bristol as part of The Bristol Festival of Ideas at 1500 BST on Saturday 20 May.\nAdd your comments on this story, using the form below.\nHomer has said many great things, one that comes to mind is :\"no problem is so big that it can't be ignored\" at first it seems irresponsible but then again life is too short and precious to keep worrying about things which we can not influence.\nRuan Hince, Budapest, Hungary\nYears ago there was a book called 'The Parables of Peanuts' that analysed the Snoopy and Charlie Brown cartoons of the same name.\nMark P, Hertford\nWhen the show first began, I said, \"No way are my kids watching this.\" But then I began to see beyond Bart and Homer's comic stupidity to the good lessons underneath. Now the whole family (the kids are grown now) watches and discuss the satire and adaptations of movies, literature and current events.\nRickey Dodd, Birmingham, AL\nCuriously, Julian's interpretation of Homer the Heretic is opposite to that the episode itself makes. The point is made (by Marge) that Homer has created these quips as excuses to disengage from faith, and has to be rescued from the fire by those still engaged enough to be willing to take action (Apu and Flanders). Far from being \"simple philosophical truths\", his quips are \"tempting excuses for inaction\". So perhaps the Simpsons' main gift is to be vague enough to read whatever you like into it.\nWilliam, Cambridge, UK\nIt's a lot to put on the shoulders of our local hero, Groening, to call him an ambassador of American culture, but every episode does seem to illustrate our country's ridiculous character in a way that no well-spoken diplomat can. I'm glad it's appreciated the world over...I'm proud every time I walk down Flanders St... and Lovejoy St... and Quimby St... and when I pass the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant.\nKara, Portland, Oregon, US\nCan we not keep the Simpsons as a funny, irreverent comment on modern Western culture? Reducing it to an abstract science takes all the pleasure out of watching it.\nBen R, Reading\nThe Simpsons has had a very positive influence on my life since I begrudgingly started watching it about 10 years ago. Bound within Greoning's imaginary world is not one world view but a whole serious of competing, and as Mr Baggini says, partial world views. Homer is an idiot savant who shows us the folly of our own rigistic thinking. He is often stupid, and sometimes irritating, but no more so that those around him who claim a more sophisticated outlook, whether it is religious, moral, legal or intellectual. And in counter pointing Homer's antics with their antithesis, such as Lisa's dogged earnestness, he allows us to compare and contrast a range of opinions and attitudes. But enough... The Simpsons rules!\nPete, Leeds\nAs Homer once said, while watching cable TV in his house (cable TV he was watching illegally): \"It's funny because it's true.\" That's why The Simpsons works.\nFran, Melbourne\nBravo! It is time that we recognised the message in the satire - I would personally liken this creation to the satirical works of Voltaire more than Kant, but if philosophy performs a function, it is in Marx's words, to change the world rather than just interpret it. Maybe it is time that society took a good hard look at itself in the mirror which seemingly banal creations like The Simpsons hold up to it.\nLaura, Cambridge\nI thought Pseuds' Corner was in Private Eye.\nMike Brown, Whitley Bay\nSurely it follows that anything created by humans will have some essence of philosophy. I remember when the Teletubbies first came out people tried the same trick. Why we can't just say, \"they're funny little yellow dudes that make me laugh\". It can work on another level, but then if you analyse anything closely it can.\nJohn, Grimsby\nWhy do philosophers say things we can't understand: \"The Simpsons, like Monty Python, is an Anglo-Saxon comedic take on the existentialism which in France takes on a more tragic hue. Albert Camus' absurd is defied not by will, but mocking laughter.\" What's that all about? The Simpsons is great because we can all relate to it.

The vote means many MPs do not openly support HS2, not including those who were forced to follow party lines.\n“Those 'no' votes and a considerable number of absentees should be sending signals that HS2 is not going to get an easy ride, and could even become a key election issue.”\nPrime Minister, David Cameron, also missed the vote, which saw 26 Tories opposed.\nThe bill confers the powers required to construct Phase One of the proposed HS2 scheme from London to Birmingham at a cost of £21.4 billion. The line is expected to be completed by 2026.\nA second bill will allow Phase Two construction to bring the line to northern cities including Manchester via a hub station in Crewe for a further £21.2 billion,estimated to be completed by 2033.\nLocal Businesses\nLocal government\nSearch\nJobs\nSearch jobs in and around Winsford\nSearch Now »\nDating\nFind the right person for you\nSearch Now »\nHomes\nSearch houses, flats, and all properties in Winsford\nSearch Now »\nCars\nSearch new & used cars in and around Winsford\nSearch Now »\nNews\nSport\nLeisure\nEvents\nE-Edition\nYour Say\nInfo\nAnnouncements\nAdvertise\nBuy & Sell\nClick2find\nDating\nCars\nHomes\nJobs\nCookie Policy\nContact Us\nSubscribe\nPhoto Sales\nAdvertise\nAdChoices\nArchive\nTopics\nAnnouncements\nSite Map\nExchange and Mart\nTwo's Company Dating\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy Policy © Copyright 2001-2014\nThis site is part of Newsquest's audited local newspaper network\nA Gannett Company\nNewsquest (North West) Ltd, 58 Church Street, Weybridge, Surrey.

Media requires JavaScript to play.\nThe BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones finds out how to make a Raspberry Pi\nMore from Rory\nA cloud of uncertainty\nA computing revolution in schools\nCan computers replace historians?\nTeenagers and the news game\nFor British computing this is quite a day. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced that a million of the tiny cheap computers aimed at transforming education have now been made in the UK.\nWhen the Pi was launched in February last year, the device was made in China. But a few months on, production was brought home to Sony's Pencoed factory in South Wales.\nWhen I visited on Monday, Gareth Jones, whose job it is to win new business for the factory, told me he got in touch with the Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton after seeing the BBC's coverage of the launch.\nAt first neither he nor Upton thought it would be possible to make the sums add up and produce the Pi at a price to compete with China. But then they thought about the cost of delivering from China, of having someone based there to oversee manufacturing and the quality control issues the project was already encountering. With some investment by Sony in machinery which automated a key part of the process, they decided it could work - and within a couple of months Pi production was up and running.\nSince then, they've been churning out as many as 12,000 a day, and showing that manufacturing can still work in the UK.\nThe Pi has been exported around the world and looks set to become the best-selling British computer since the 1980s - though as it retails at about £30, it will never earn the revenues that the likes of the ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro achieved.\nMore from Rory on Raspberry Pi\nRaspberry Pi gets camera add-on\nClever ideas with a tiny computer\nThe Pi Store opens\nA rapturous reception\nRipples from the Raspberry Pi\n\"I remember being told this was an unsaleable product,\" says Upton, satisfied at having proved the doubters wrong. \"But we've already surpassed the sales of the BBC Micro - my childhood computer. There was a latent need for something like this.\"\nBut amid all the celebrations, there is some soul-searching. Their project may have inspired middle-aged hobbyists around the world to invent all sorts of weird and wonderful things, from a Pi-powered bear leaping out of a balloon to any number of robots, musical instruments and vehicles.\nBut for the Raspberry Pi Foundation that was never the aim. Their mission was to transform the way children in the UK - and then in other countries - understood and used computers. True, the Raspberry Pi has been an important part of the debate which has seen the ICT curriculum ripped up and a commitment to bring in coding for children from the age of five next September.\nPlease turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\nEben Upton: \"It's been a rollercoaster year\"\nBut there isn't an awful lot of evidence that a computer designed for children is in the hands of many at the moment. Upton admits that this is a concern - and the focus must now be on education. After a donation from Google aimed at giving 15,000 Pis to children, former ICT teacher Clive Beale was appointed to drive this mission forwards.\nOne of the issues is training ICT teachers - after all, the bare board Raspberry Pi looks quite intimidating to anyone whose main experience has been taking students through the intricacies of Microsoft Word rather than programming.\nBut before talking to Upton, we had filmed an inspiring lesson at the nearby St John's College School, to see an example of what can be done.\nMaking music with Sonic Pi\nDr Sam Aaron, from the Cambridge University Computing Lab, has developed a program called Sonic Pi which uses the mini computer to make music. First, to illustrate how coding worked, he got the class of 10- and 11-year-olds to stand in a row passing instructions down the line.\nThen they sat in pairs typing lines of Sonic Pi code to make some arresting musical compositions. Children who had never done much more with a computer than turn it on and play Angry Birds were getting a hands-on experience of how creative the coding process could be.\nBut making this experience available much more widely will be a challenge.\nThe keenest young people will find a way to get into computers, but the majority, if presented with a Raspberry Pi for Christmas, will probably stick it in a drawer and go and turn on the XBox.

That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it.\"\nDiscussing the often \"inward-looking\" history of EU negotiations, Mr Gordon said that \"referendums have often turned countries inward\".\n\"The more the EU reflects on its internal debate, the less it is able to be unified,\" he said.\n'Divisive rows'\nIn response to Mr Gordon's comments, No 10 said: \"The US wants an outward-looking EU with Britain in it, and so do we.\"\nConservative MP Dominic Raab, a Eurosceptic, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a more unified Europe would actually \"decouple\" the UK and the US and lead to \"divisive rows\".\nHe said Britain needed to do what was in its interests and \"not what is convenient for the Americans\" and argued that the US had misunderstood the consequences of a more unified EU.\nContinue reading the main story “Start Quote\n\"It gives us influence over the world's largest single market, but it also strengthens out relationship the United states”\nEnd Quote\nDouglas Alexander\nShadow foreign secretary\nHe said: \"Historically the US wanted two contradictory things out of Europe and out of Britain in Europe. Since Kissinger's day we've heard that plea - when I deal with Europe who do I call? The Americans want the united Europe because, as a matter of convenience, they've got one port of call, one telephone that they need to ring up.\n\"But that inevitably means more integration and more federalism. The irony is that the more the EU unifies, the more federalist it becomes, the more decoupled Britain would become from America and the less anglo saxon its outlook would be.\n\"The more the EU stands up on its own two feet the more we're going to see very divisive rows with the US. We had it over Iraq, Kyoto, the ICC, the war on terror. If the UK was part of that federalising approach... we would inevitably become more decoupled from the US.\"\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the US had recognised that Britain's influence in the world and its relationship with the US was strengthened by its membership of the EU.\n\"It gives us influence over the world's largest single market, but it also strengthens out relationship the United states and critically it amplifies the United Kingdom's influence in a world where both economic and political power is shifting to the east,\" he said.\n\"David Cameron is marooned between a party that wants a referendum as a proxy for exit and public who I think understand that the overriding challenge for Britain is to deliver investment, jobs and prosperity.\"\n \nMore on This Story\nMore from Politics\nG8 summit 'won't be held in Russia'\nPM outlines inheritance tax ambition\nUK army in Germany 'rethink' urged\nMitchell had 'history of aggression'\nGuide: How parliament works\nLatest opinion polls\nHS2 'will not link to Eurostar'\nRelated Stories\nUS concerns over UK vote on EU\n09 JANUARY 2013,\nPOLITICS\nPM urged not to 'risk' EU membership\n09 JANUARY 2013,\nPOLITICS\nPM's 'real change' pledge on EU\n04 JANUARY 2013,\nPOLITICS\nComments\nThis entry is now closed for comments\nJump to comments pagination  \nEditors' Picks\nAll Comments 1290\nOrder by:\nLatest First\nHighest Rated\nLowest Rated\nrate this\n+5\nrate this\n+5\nComment number 930.\ntwidge\n10th January 2013 - 15:04 sod the u.s. what about the u.k.\nReport this comment (Comment number 930)\nLink to this (Comment number 930)\nrate this\n+4\nrate this\n+4\nComment number 929.\nwotto\n10th January 2013 - 15:04 Lets just continue to muddle along with our relationship with the EU & get from it what is best for us.

Italyâs coastguard has denied it was too slow to help.\nOn Saturday, French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called for an EU meeting over the deaths of the mostly Eritrean and Somali migrants.\nâItâs a terrible tragedy. It is important that European policymakers meet soon to discuss this together,â he told reporters during a visit to the city of Metz.\nThe 111 coffins of the migrants were lined up in an airport hangar on Saturday, where survivors paid their respects. Up to 500 people were believed to be on the boat that sank less than a kilometer off the coast of Lampedusa in the early hours of Thursday morning. Officials say just 155 people survived, and hundreds are still missing.\nThe search to recover more bodies was called off for a second day due to wind and poor sea conditions. The boat, which is submerged in about 40 meters of water (131 feet), sunk after a fire onboard triggered a rush to one side of the boat, causing it to capsize.\nÂ \nItalyâs coastguard has disputed claims that it took 45 minutes to one hour to reach the scene, saying it arrived within 20 minutes of receiving the first call. It has also denied reports it prevented private boats from joining rescue efforts once emergency services had been deployed.\nThe boatâs 35-year-old Tunisian skipper has been arrested on charges of people smuggling. A spokesman from Tunisiaâs interior ministry told the news agency DPA that the boat had set off from Libya, and passed close to the Tunisian coastal town of Sfax, on its way to Lampedusa.\nThe tiny fishing and tourist island is located halfway between Sicily and Tunisia and over the years has seen tens of thousands of asylum seekers from Africa arriving in its port in unseaworthy boats.\nPossible violation of âlaw of the seaâ\nMeanwhile, a parliamentary delegation visited survivors amid reports that nearby boats may have failed to help those drowning. Failure to assist a fellow vessel is a violation of âthe law of the sea.â\nâTo come to rescue is a duty. Not to come to rescue is a crime,â said Laura Boldrini, the Italian house speaker. Boldrini was previously the UN Refugee Agency spokeswoman in Italy.\nBoldrini said the law of the sea requires assistance to anyone in need. Survivors have told authorities that a boat passed without helping, but no vessel has been identified and prosecutors have not yet launched any formal investigations.\nDramatic footage has also emerged of a young Eritrean man being hauled on board a private boat during the rescue.\nâYou have to search or 480 people are going to die!â he is heard saying in the video, released by Italian TG2 news. âOh my god!â the man says, after bursting into tears and spitting out sea water.\nSome fisherman have spoken of their efforts to rescue the migrants from the shipwreck. Vito Fiorini said he pulled 47 from the sea, some of whom were stripped of their clothing while others were slippery from being covered in gasoline.\nTourist fisherman Marcello Nizza told the news agency AFP he could have âsaved more if help had come in time and if they had allowed us to go out again.â\nBoldrini said survivors have asked lawmakers to be allowed to identify the deceased and repatriate the remains back home. Leonardo Ricci, a spokesman for the rescuers, said there was a âpreliminary planâ to raise the boatâs wreck from the seabed.\nâWe have a legal but also a moral responsibility to recover all the bodies,â he said.\nImmigration law in the spotlight\nThe mayor of Lampedusa, Giusi Nicolini, has said private citizens may have been put off coming to the rescue, due to a controversial law against people seen as facilitating illegal immigration.\nâThe fishing boats left because our country has taken to court fisherman and ship owners who saved lives and were accused of favoring illegal immigration. The government has to change these inhuman norms,â Nicolini told reporters.\nOn Saturday, fisherman from the island went out to sea in their boats and laid a wreath in memory of those drowned.\nItaly, meanwhile, has asked for its increasing refugee influx to be put on the agenda of a meeting of EU interior ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday.\njr/rc (AFP, Reuters, dpa)\nhttp://www.dw.de/anger-grows-over-italys-lampedusa-shipwreck-tragedy-as-survivors-mourn-dead/a-17137535\nÂ \nLeave a Comment\nClick here to cancel reply.\nName (required)\nEmail (hidden) (required)\nWebsite\nnext\nprev\nSectarianism in the Middle East and its rise in the UK, Standpoint, Sahar TV.

Dim sylw.\nTagiau: Brian Flynn, PÃªl-droed rhyngwladol\nMae deuddydd cyn i Gymru herio Bwlgaria mewn gÃªm dyngedfennol i obeithion ein hymgyrch rhagbrofol Ewro 2012. Owain Schiavone syân awgrymu y bydd rheolwr dros droâr tÃ®m rhyngwladol, Brian Flynn yn teimlo rhwystredigaeth wrth baratoi ei garfanâ¦\nCwta fis yn ei swydd fel rheolwr dros dro Cymru, a cyn ei gÃªm gyntaf wrth y llyw, ac mae Brian Flynn yn gwybod yn union am y rhwystredigaeth yr oedd John Toshack yn ei deimlo yn ystod ei chwe blynedd yntauân rheoliâr tÃ®m rhyngwladol.\nRoedd Flynn yn gwybod cyn derbyn y swydd y byddai dau o sÃªr mwyaf disglair Cymru, Aaron Ramsey a Jack Collison, yn eisiau ar gyfer y gemau yn erbyn Bwlgaria aâr Swistir syân cael eu chwarae dros yr wythnos nesaf.\nPenbleth Bellamy\nÂ \nDaeth yr ergyd fawr gyntaf iâw gynlluniau felly pan ddaeth iâr amlwg na fyddaiâr capten, Craig Bellamy, yn ffit i fod yn ei garfan. Digon teg o ystyried ar y pryd nad oedd Bellamy wedi chwaraeâr un gÃªm i Gaerdydd ers iddo frifo ei ben-glin yn y gÃªm yn erbyn Montenegro. Beth syân peri penbleth ydyâr ffaith i Bellamy chwarae gÃªm lawn iâw glwb yn erbyn Barnsley ddydd Sadwrn, gan edrych mor ffit ag erioed wrth arwain ei dÃ®m i fuddugoliaeth.\nMae adroddiadauân awgrymu fod Flynn a Dave Jones wedi dod i ddealltwriaeth ynglÅ·n Ã¢ Bellamy, a bod cytundeb rhyngddynt nad yw ei ben-glin yn ddigon cryf i chwarae dwy gÃªm mewn wythnos ar hyn o bryd. Wedi dweud hynny, maeân rhyfedd iawn na fydd capten Cymru yn cymryd unrhyw ran yn yr un oâr ddwy gÃªm syân gwbl dyngedfennol iâr ymgyrch ragbrofolâ¦ac efallai cyfle olaf Bellamy i chwarae mewn rowndiau terfynol iâw wlad. Efallai bod mwy iddi nad ydan niân gwybod amdano, ond rhaid dweud bod parodrwydd Flynn i roi mewn i Jones yn awgrymu gwendid yn y rheolwr newydd.\nEr gwaethaf absenoldeb Bellamy, roedd golwg digon soled iâr garfan a gafodd ei enwi gan Flynn ddydd Gwener diwethaf. Roedd rhai oâr enwau ifanc newydd yn y garfan yn awgrymu bod Flynn yn sicr aâi olygon ar ddyfodol tymor hir yn y swydd, traâi bod hefyd yn braf gweld enwauâr ddau Danny, Gabbidon a Collins nÃ´l yn y dewis o amddiffynwyr.\nSbaner yn y wyrcs\nDechreuodd pethau fynd o chwith i Flynn ddydd Llun, gydaâr newyddion fod Rob Earnshaw wedi tynnu nÃ´l oâr garfan gydag anaf.\nCafodd Flynn ergyd arall iâw gynlluniau yn hwyrach y diwrnod hwnnw wrth i Danny Gabbidon benderfynu ei bod yn bryd ymddeol o bÃªl-droed rhyngwladol. Dymaâr math o sefyllfa a gododd droeon yn ystod teyrnasiad John Toshack wrth gwrs. Mae Gabbidon wedi cael amser erchyll gydag anafiadau dros y ddwy flynedd ddiwethaf, ac mae rhywun yn deall ei benderfyniad er mwyn ceisio diogelu ei ddyfodol ar lefel clwb. Yr hyn dwiân methu aâi ddeall ydy pam cyhoeddiâr newyddion ddyddiau ar Ã´l iddo gael ei enwi yng ngharfan Cymru? Roedd Gabbidon bownd o fod yn gwybod ei fod yn mynd i gael ei enwi yn y garfan felly pam ddim rhoi gwybod i Flynn cyn iddo wneud y cyhoeddiad yn hytrach na rhoi ergyd iâw gynlluniau fel hyn? Does dim amheuaeth fod Gabbidon wedi bod yn was ffyddlon iâw wlad dros y blynyddoedd felly maeâr ffordd y mae wedi ymdrin Ã¢ hyn yn siomedig.\nDaeth yr ergyd ddiweddaraf i Flynn ddoe gydaâr newyddion bod Brian Stock o Doncaster a Neal Eardley o Blackpool yn tynnu nÃ´l gydag anafiadau. Yn wahanol i Gabbidon, maeân annhebygol y byddaiâr un oâr rhain wedi dechrauâr gÃªm yn erbyn Bwlgaria. Er hynny, petai chwaraewyr yn codi anafiadau neu waharddiad oâr gÃªm honno, yna bydden nhw wedi bod yn ddefnyddiol ar gyfer yr ail gÃªm allan yn y Swistir. Mae hynnyân arbennig o wir yn achos Eardley sydd wedi bod yn chwaraeân rheolaidd i Blackpool yn yr Uwch Gynghrair eleni.\nYchwanegu enwau defnyddiol\nEr y gellid dadlau mae chwaraewyr ymylol ydy tri oâr rhain, mae colli pum chwaraewr yn mynd i wanhau carfan ac mae gweld chwaraewyr yn tynnu nÃ´l rhoiâr neges anghywir.\nÂ \nMae Flynn wedi ychwanegu Darcy Blake, Neil Taylor, Andrew Crofts a Ryan Doble iâr garfan bellach. Mae Crofts wedi sgorio tair gÃ´l mewn 10 gÃªm Bencampwriaeth i Norwich eleni gan helpu ei dÃ®m i gyrraedd y trydydd safle yn y gynghrair, felly maeân syndod nad oedd yn y garfan beth bynnag. Mae Blake hefyd wedi bod yn chwaraeân rheolaidd i Gaerdydd ac mae ei allu i chwarae mewn nifer o safleoedd yn golygu ei fod yn foi defnyddiol iâw gael yn y garfan.Â \nMae enw Ryan Doble yn un diddorol hefyd. Dim ond 19 oed ydy Doble, a tydi o ddim wedi chwarae i dÃ®m cyntaf Southampton eto. Er hynny, fe chwaraeodd ei gÃªm gyntaf i dÃ®m dan-21 Cymru yn erbyn Hwngari fis diwethaf ac maeân amlwg fod gan Flynn feddwl mawr ohono.Â \nGan gymryd na fydd yna fwy o chwaraewyr yn tynnu nÃ´l oâr garfan, mae gan Flynn ddigon o chwaraewyr i ddewis tÃ®m a all guro Bwlgaria nos Wener. Gan ddibynnu ar y system y bydd Flynn yn ei mabwysiadu, dwiân disgwyl iâr tÃ®m edrych rhywbeth fel hyn:\n1)Â Â Â Â Â  Wayne Hennessey\n2)Â Â Â Â Â  Chris Gunter\n3)Â Â Â Â Â  Danny Collins\n4)Â Â Â Â Â  Ashley Williams\n5)Â Â Â Â Â  James Collins\n6)Â Â Â Â Â  David Edwards\n7)Â Â Â Â Â  David Vaughan\n8)Â Â Â Â Â  Joe Ledley\n9)Â Â Â Â Â  Steve MorisonÂ 10)Â Â  Simon Church\n11)Â Â  Gareth Bale\nUn chwaraewr a allai orfodi ei ffordd mewn iâr XI cyntaf ydy Andy King o Leicester, ac os fydd Flynn yn dewis chwarae gyda phump yng nghanol cae maeân bosib y bydd yn cael ei ddewis cyn Simon Church.\nÂ \nMaeâr amddiffyn, gydag ychwanegiad Danny Collins syân awyddus i greu argraff, yn edrych yn ddigon soled. Maeâr canol cae yn cynnwys 4 chwaraewr syân chwarae ar y lefel uchaf yn Lloegr aâr Alban hefyd, ond byddai gallu ychwanegu Ramsey a Collison yn gwneud cymaint o wahaniaeth. Y broblem fwyaf i Flynn fydd sgorio goliau ac unwaith eto dwiân gweld y dasg yn disgyn i Steve Morison o Milwall sydd wedi sgorio 4 gÃ´l mewn 10 gÃªm iâw glwb hyd yn hyn eleni. Bydd angen iddo drosglwyddoâr hwyl yna i lefel rhyngwladol os oes gobaith i Gymru gipio 4 pwynt oâr ddwy gÃªm yma.\nTa ta Tosh!\nCyhoeddwyd Medi 8, 2010 gan Cyfranwyr Gwadd. 1 Sylw.\nTagiau: John Toshack, PÃªl-droed, PÃªl-droed rhyngwladol\nTa Ta Tosh â¦ chwe mlynedd yn hen ddigon meddai Iwan Williams, cefnogwr pÃªl droed brwd.\nâY peth gorau am golli yn Montenegro yw ymadawiad hir-ddisgwyliedig yr hyfforddwr.â\nFe aeth bron i 500 o gefnogwyr Cymru draw i Fontenegro yn llawn gobaith, gyda llawer yn ffyddiog fod y chwaraewyr ifanc sydd wedi chwarae i Gymru dros y blynyddoedd diwethaf yn barod i gystadlu gyda goreuon y grÅµp a cheisio am le yn Ewro 2012.\nStori go wahanol oedd hi ar Ã´l 90 munud poenus yn Podgorica, gydaâr mwyafrif wedi digalonniân llwyr ac yn galw am ymddiswyddiad John Toshack ar Ã´l siom arall.\nYn bersonol, fe ddylai John Toshack fod wedi gorffen gyda Chymru yn llawer cynt! Fel cefnogwr ffyddlon iâr tÃ®m cenedlaethol, mae 6 mlynedd o Tosh yn hen ddigon. Fe wnaeth gwaith da yn cyfnewid y tÃ®m ar Ã´l cyfnod Mark Hughes, gan gyflwyno chwaraewyr ifanc, dawnus, megis Hennessey, Gunter, Bale, Collison, Church, Vokes a Ramsey. Rhaid oedd rhoi amser iâr chwaraewyr hyn ddysgu eu crefft ym mwrlwm pÃªl droed rhyngwladol, ac roedd hyn yn ddigon teg. Ond wrth i amser symud yn ei flaen, nid oedd y canlyniadau yn gwella a chynyddu wnaeth esgusodion Toshack.\nBu llawer o anghytuno ar Ã´l y gÃªm ym Montenegro ymysg cefnogwyr Cymru ynglÅ·n Ã¢ chyfnod Toshack fel rheolwr Cymru. Fel arfer, nid oeddwn yn cytuno gyda thimau Toshack naâr tactegau, ond rhaid cyfaddef roeddwn iân bles i weld y tÃ®m a ddewiswyd yn Podgorica, gydaâr sÃªr mwyaf, Bellamy a Bale, ar yr esgyll, a chyfle arall i Steve Morison fel blaenwr. Yn gynnar yn y gÃªm rodd hiân amlwg fod Montenegro yn well tÃ®m, yn cadwâr bÃªl yn well, ac nid oedd system Cymru yn helpuâr chwaraewyr. Mae Toshack yn hyfforddwr pengaled ac yn amharod iawn i newid ei dactegau cyn neu yn ystod gemau, ac unwaith sgoriodd Montenegro rodd hiân amlwg fod angen newid system Cymru, rhoi safle mwy ymosodol i Bellamy a gwneud yn siÅµr fod y rhai yng nghanol cae, sef Vaughan, Ledley, ac Edwards, yn dechrau creu argraff ar y gÃªm.\nRoedd yr amddiffyn yn sigledig iawn, gyda chapten Montenegro, Vucinic, yn creu amryw o broblemau i James Collins aâr amddiffynwyr eraill, ac roedd hiân amlwg fod hyder y chwaraewyr yn isel. Er i Simon Church fwrwâr trawst yn yr ail hanner, bach iawn oedd cyfleoedd Cymru i sgorio ac roedd cyfle arbennig i ddechrau ymgyrch newydd gyda chanlyniad da wedi diflannu.\nRwyân gwerthfawrogi ymdrechion Toshack i chwarae pÃªl droed deniadol, pwyllog, ond rhaid chwarae i gryfderauâr chwaraewyr, ac, yn anffodus, nid yw chwaraewyr Cymru yn ddigon da i chwaraeâr system yma o bÃªl droed yn erbyn gwrthwynebwyr o safon. Mae gan Gymru chwaraewyr gwell na Gogledd Iwerddon, er enghraifft, ond mae Gogledd Iwerddon yn chwarae iâw cryfderau, yn ymateb iâw rheolwr ac yn cynhyrchu canlyniadau da yn gyson.\nYn amlwg mae Toshack wedi methu ac ysbrydoliâr chwaraewyr, mae ei steil rheoli yn anaddas i reoli tÃ®m yn yr 21ain ganrif, ac rwyf wedi blinoân lan arno yn sÃ´n am ei ddyddiau yn chwarae i Lerpwl a rheoli Real Madrid (nid unwaith, ond ddwywaith cofiwch!) yn bob un cyfweliad.

Dim sylw.\nTagiau: Cymru, Lwcsembwrg, PÃªl-droed, PÃªl-droed rhyngwladol\nCymru v Lwcsembwrg â sgorioâr chwaraewyr\nRoedd y fuddugoliaeth yn un gyfforddus iâr Cymry ar Barc y Scarlets, ond pa berfformiadau unigol oedd yn sefyll allan? Owain Schiavone syân asesu safon y chwaraewyr.\nWayne Hennessey â Anlwcus gydaâr gÃ´l yn ei erbyn wrth iâr ergyd wyro oddi ar droed un oâi amddiffynwyr. Dim problemau fel arall. 6/10\nSam Ricketts â GÃªm dawel ond ddigon taclus. Prin iawn oedd ei rediadau ymosodol arferol. Tebygol o golli ei le os yw Bale yn ffit, ond handi iâw gael yn y garfan. 6\nChris Gunter â Fel Ricketts, tawel ond effeithiol. Dim problemauân amddiffynnol a gwelwyd rhai rhediadau ymosodol ganddo tuag at ddiwedd y gÃªm. 6\nAshley Williams â Roedd cymysgwch rhyngddo a Morgan ar gyfer gÃ´l yr ymwelwyr ond fel arall yn soled fel arfer ac yn dechrau sefydlu ei hun fel un oâr enwau cyntaf yn nhÃ®m Tosh. 8\nCraig Morgan â Wastad wedi bod Ã¢ photensial enfawr, ac yn dechrau edrych fel amddiffynnwr rhyngwladol syân gallu camu i esgidiau James Collins pan nad yw ar gael. 7\nJoe Ledley â Hanner cyntaf digon swta ond yn chwaraewr gwahanol gyda Vaughan wrth ei ochr yn yr ail. Gwaith da droeon rhyngddo a Bellamy. 8\nDavid Cotterill â Ei gÃªm orau dros Gymru hyd yn hyn. Os all berfformioân gyson i Abertawe eleni fe allai fod yn gaffaeliad i Gymru. 8\nBrian Stock â Ei chael hiân anodd codi i safon pÃªl-droed rhyngwladol. Rhai cyffyrddiadauân awgrymu fod potensial ond angen profiad gyda chlwb ar safon uwch. Cymerodd Vaughan ei le yn y canol i newid y gÃªm. 5\nCraig Bellamy â Seren y gÃªm. Hanner cyntaf rhwystredig ond yn wych yn yr ail wrth i basio Vaughan gael y gorau allan ohono ar yr asgell chwith. Roedd y newid siÃ¢p i 4-5-1 hefyd yn rhoi mwy o ryddid iddo. 9\nSteve Morison â Fe weithiodd yr ymosodwr mawr yn galed yn ei gÃªm ryngwladol gyntaf gan roi llwyfan da iâr ymosod. Anodd credu ei fod yn chwarae i Stevenage Borough ychydig dros flwyddyn yn Ã´l! Rhywbeth iâw gynnig i Gymru yn y gemau rhagbrofol. 7\nRobert Earnshaw â Digon bywiog yn ei hanner canfed gÃªm i Gymru, ac roedd ei groesiad yn berffaith iâr gÃ´l gyntaf. Anlwcus i gael ei eilyddio ar yr hanner, ond yn angenrheidiol i newid siÃ¢p y tÃ®m. Â \nEilyddion:\nBoaz Myhill (am Hennessey 46â)â Ychydig iawn o waith iâw wneud wrth i Gymru reoliâr ail hanner. 6\nDavid Vaughan (am Earnshaw 46â) â Y Sbarc a drawsnewidiodd y gÃªm yn yr ail hanner. Dim byd ffansi, dim ond chwarae taclus, awydd i gael y bÃªl a phasio cywrain. Gwthio Bellamyân agos fel seren y gÃªm. 9\nAndy King (am Stock 46â) â 45 munud da ac enw iâr dyfodol.

This compares with rises of 2.1% and 2% respectively in the strong second quarter of the year.\nIs that a bump in the road after an extraordinary 35 quarters of unbroken growth? Yes, but not one such that King is likely to feel desperately uncomfortable.\nMore interesting is the piece of the jigsaw Sainsbury's provides to explain what happened to retailers and to household consumption in the Christmas period.\nAs I said on Monday, October and much of November were difficult months for the high street. But the Christmas period itself was strong, with King saying the seven days prior to 25 December were the busiest ever for the business.\nThe other important trends for all retailers were these:\nSales of more expensive items - cars, televisions, tablets and so on - were strong. At Sainsbury's, there was a 25% jump in tableware and 30% in \"gifting\".\n2013 was the year in which online sales wagged the entire retailing dog, in a revolution that is permanent. The best performing store chains, Next, John Lewis and House of Fraser, are those with huge and efficient online presences. And at Sainsbury's, online grocery sales rose more than 10%.\nThe confidence of shoppers that online purchases will arrive in a timely way is shown by 22 December being Sainsbury's biggest-ever day for internet sales. In previous years, digital sales had tapered off so close to Christmas.\nSo what about Tesco, Sainsbury's much bigger rival, which reports tomorrow?\nMy hunch is that this Christmas will have been good for Tesco, in the sense of how its owners see the course and strategy set by the chief executive Philip Clarke.\nThis is not to say that the headline numbers will look great. There is bound to have been a fall in like-for-like, or underlying, sales, and so the simple direct comparison with Sainsbury's will not flatter Tesco.\nBut that disguises Tesco's strengths - especially in online - which Clarke is reinforcing.\nâStart Quote\nOver the course of a year, the share of digital in Tesco's sales is said to have jumped several percentage pointsâ\nEnd Quote\nClarke has made a big and expensive bet that the future will be digital, and not about huge out-of-town stores.\nThe fruits of that are not yet conspicuous, in that there is still a big drag on sales from the way Clarke has permanently rebalanced sales away from less intrinsically profitable general merchandise towards food in the big stores and from the declining popularity of vast superstores.\nBut internet sales are growing at a remarkable rate - analysts believe digital, from a much bigger starting point than at Sainsbury's, has grown at a double-digit rate and rather faster than Sainsbury's.\nAnd over the course of a year, the share of digital in Tesco's sales is said to have jumped several percentage points from under 5% of sales. For a business of Tesco's size - with its 10% share of the entire retail market - that is quite something.\nClarke has been reinforcing Tesco's \"multi-channel\" approach with the almost 500,000 own-brand Hudl tablets it sold in just the past few months. He is thought to have plans to follow up with another tablet and a smart phone.\nAs a result of digital, especially the so-called click-and-collect, approach to sales, Tesco has unrivalled access to UK consumers. For example, the citizens of Stornoway and the Hebrides will shortly be able to order online and collect their groceries from a depot by the ferry port.\nAll of which is not to say that Tesco will suddenly find itself increasing its profits as it did in the Leahy and Maclaurin years. Those days are gone, probably forever - because Tesco's market share is now so enormous, and is at the limit of what consumers are likely to tolerate.\nBut after their initial doubts, Tesco's owners may start to feel more confident that Clarke is keeping the giant baby in the bathwater, rather than - as they feared - seeing it disappear down the plughole.\nÂ \nArticle written by Robert Peston\nRobert Peston\nBusiness editor\nMore from Robert\nForward guidance to be modified\n17:29 UK time, Friday, 7 February 2014\nThe Governor of the Bank of England will next week unveil a changed framework for providing reassurance that interest rates are unlikely to be increased sharply any time soon.\nRead full article\nMore on This Story\nMore from Robert\nNo fall in Barclays bonuses\nWho isnât probing banksâ alleged currency rigging?\nIs UK's housing-finance system broken?\nLloyds: 'Normal' again\nHousing: Recovery or boom?\nThe sterling price of Scottish independence\nThe third horseman?\nThe meaning of Labour's tax rise\nBankers back in PM's tent\nWill inequality rise in this recovery?\nDavos: What Abe said\nWill IMFâs Blanchard blanch?\nAn unholy pension hole\nThe good and bad of China's growth\nWhy Labour's bank break-up has not hurt shares\nLabour to force bank break-ups\nWhat UK debts are Scotland's?\nTesco, Morrisons and M&S: Ouch\nWhat happens when PPI cash runs out?\nWhose fault is M&S's stagnation?\nThe impact of the chancellor's new cuts\nBarclays: 'Five to 10 years to be trusted again'\nIs this really 'banking union'?\nA messy banking union\nAirports: What's the big fuss?\nIs prudential tinkering our salvation?\nFood prices in an independent Scotland\nHow sustainable is the UK's economic recovery?\nComments\nThis entry is now closed for comments\nJump to comments pagination Â \nAll Comments 255\nOrder by:\nLatest First\nHighest Rated\nLowest Rated\nrate this\n+3\nrate this\n+3\nComment number 175.\nYeokel\n8th January 2014 - 18:09 155.fallingTP\n\"...Every time we figure out how to accomplish a goal using fewer workers, it enriches society!\"\nIt doesn't enrich the poor sods who get chucked on to the dole though, does it?\nReport this comment (Comment number 175)\nLink to this (Comment number 175)\nrate this\n0\nrate this\n0\nComment number 174.\nthelastofthefew\n8th January 2014 - 18:07 Duggan inquest conclusion open it .....Please...bet you don`t\nReport this comment (Comment number 174)\nLink to this (Comment number 174)\nrate this\n+2\nrate this\n+2\nComment number 173.\nlibranmeg\n8th January 2014 - 18:00 Tesco used to be good when they did not have much competition.
