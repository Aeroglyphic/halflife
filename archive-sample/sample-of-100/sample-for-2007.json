However, if it was done in the way that they were ganging up on your son and it was intended as humiliation or to be nasty, then it is bullying and needs to be stopped.\nYou may find that your son has joined in and done this to other kids and this time it was his turn and its unfortunate that he is excruciatingly ticklish. The problem is if they realised how ticklish he was then the kids probably would have taken it a bit too far without realising.\nYou say it was 9 of his friends so its more likely it was meant as a bit of fun rather than malace.\nObviously, if you feel that this was a case of bullying then you need to speak to the school and get it sorted. \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tReply \n\t\t\t\tQuote\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLpotter1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Sat October 07, 2006 10:40 PM\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMember\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPosts: 1\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJoined: Oct 2006\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI personally dont think its that bad.

He hates it, and its all around his stomach and chest - so much so that even TLC is difficult!!  If you don't go through this you cannot possibly understand how awful it is - just because it's called something 'cute'.  I'm sorry, but if we exchanged 'tickling' with 'cigarette burns' then you would have a different stance.  It is bullying because it's making someone suffer.

          "= Welcome to the Phoebe Project === A practitioner-focused environment to support design for learning ==The Phoebe project aims to guide practitioners working in post-compulsory learning (FE, HE and ACL) in designing effective and pedagogically sound learning activities. To realise this aim, the project team proposes to: * Develop a prototype online planning tool that will offer users both flexible and guided paths through the planning process and enable them to access a wide range of models, research findings and examples of innovative learning designs, intended to encourage them to explore new approaches and tools in their pedagogy; * User-test the planning tool for functionality and usability; and * Investigate the feasibility of further development and the integration of the planning tool into pedagogic practice by embedding use of the planning tool into a specific context for piloting and evaluation: namely, initial practitioner training and/or continuing professional development. For more information on different aspects of the project, please follow the links below:  * [wiki:AboutTheProject About the Project] * [wiki:ExpStructure Designer's Sandpit]: the area in which we are mapping out the structure and content of the tool. * [http://phoebe-app.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki Prototype]: an initial working version of the planner tool * [wiki:PractitionerInvolvement Practitioner-Focused Design and Evaluation] * [wiki:ContentDevelopment Content Development] * [wiki:TechnicalDevelopment Technical Development]== Project News ==Most recent news is first. * 04/12/06: FINALLY! We have finished analysing the data from the Experts' Group meeting. You can read all about it in [wiki:ConsultationActivity261006 this report]. * 31/10/06: Thanks to everyone at the e-learning and Pedagogy Experts' Group who participated in our exercise on how people design learning. * 02/10/06: Dave has demonstrated his work so far on the tool to Marion and Liz. We hope to have a \"sandpit\" version available by the end of this month. Are you a member of the JISC E-learning and Pedagogy Experts Group? If so, we hope that you will come to the group meeting at Aston University on Thursday 26th October, where Marion and Liz will be running an interactive session to gather your ideas for Phoebe. * 26/09/06: Back to work in earnest! We have now analysed our interviews with the [wiki:PractitionerInformants practitioner-informants] and have constructed a number of scenarios of practice in order to build an understanding of the types of situation in which Phoebe might (or might not!) be an appropriate support tool. * 06/09/06: Marion took part in a symposium with other projects in the D4L programme at the ALT 2006 conference in Edinburgh. You can [http://phoebe-project.conted.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/phoebe.pdf download the flyer] which we produced for distribution at the symposium. * 05/09/06: The [wiki:Evaluation evaluation plan] has been updated again!For older news see the NewsArchive.== Contacts ==For further information about the project, please contact: * [mailto:marion.manton@conted.ox.ac.uk Marion Manton] – project management * [mailto:liz.masterman@oucs.ox.ac.uk Liz Masterman] – research, content, development methodology and evaluation * [mailto:david.balch@conted.ox.ac.uk David Balch] – technical issuesUploadedFiles----This project page runs on the Trac enhanced wiki and issue tracking system.To learn more about Trac in general, the TracGuide is a good place to start.[[br]]For a complete list of local wiki pages, see TitleIndex.Trac is brought to you by [http://www.edgewall.com/ Edgewall Software],providing professional Linux and software development services to clientsworldwide.

Note that “non-metal” refers to items whose primary components are not metal; these items may contain some metal components. Guidance for items whose primary component is metal is given in the “Recycling of Metal Waste and Scrap” Section.\n\nThe recycling of non-metal materials is a very diverse area which includes both single stream and mixed materials. Guidance is given here for the items that are most commonly recycled. Much of this guidance will also be applicable to the recycling of materials that are not specifically mentioned here.\n\nThe initial stages of recycling of non-metal materials vary in their complexity depending on the product involved. The simplest processes involve the baling and/or sorting of products before they are shredded or crushed to make them suitable for further processing. This process is used for products such as plastics, glass, tyres, wood, paper and textiles.\n\nOther materials, such as oil and chemicals, are more hazardous. Some chemicals may be hazardous because they contain heavy metals and solvents. Recycling these materials requires extra care to ensure that these chemicals do not cause harm to human health or the surrounding environment. \n\nRecycling of organic material by composting must comply with a large number of regulations, especially in relation to animal by-products.\n\n\n\n        \n  \t\tThe further treatment or processing of materials following baling, sorting, shredding or crushing is not covered by these guidelines. Click on the link below for guidance on the further treatment of waste materials:\n  \t\t\tFurther Treatment of Materials\n\n\t\t\n\nThe guidelines for this sector are divided into the following areas:\n\nBusiness areas\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBaling, Sorting, Shredding and Crushing of Waste Material\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOil and Chemicals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComposting and Biodigestion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n   \n \n  \n\t\t  \n  \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n|\n\tContact Environment Agency  | Contact Environment and Heritage Service (NI)  | Contact SEPA |\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tBack to top of page\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    © NetRegs 2007\n \n\t\t\t     Page last updated: Wednesday 13 October 2004\n\n\t\t\t      Privacy Policy\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    Author: Gill Bellamy | enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t",

It can be useful to use an \n              absorbent bed pad or chair pad to protect against possible spillage, \n              especially if your grip or eyesight may be a problem. In some situations \n              a rug over your knees can give privacy (for instance, in a car).\n\n            Other considerations include:-\n\n            \tMaterial the urinal is made from: lightweight plastic types \n                are useful if you have weak wrists.\n\tHandles where your strength of grip is a problem. A rubber sleeve \n                around the handle will add extra grip. An extended handle may \n                help if your wrist movement is limited.\n\t Spill-proof design - this is particularly important if you \n                have shaky hands or poor eyesight. \n\tHow easy it is to use and to clean. Daily washing of a urinal \n                in a mild antiseptic solution is recommended to prevent odour \n                problems. \n\t Availability - for people living at home, some types of urinal \n                are normally available via the NHS district nursing service. Sometimes \n                voluntary organisations, such as the Red Cross, provide a loan \n                service, or they can be purchased from local chemists or via mail \n                order.\n\n\n             Tips\n\n            \t A sachet of gel powder in the urinal will soak up most of the \n                fluid and reduce the risk of spills.\n\tA waterproof-backed chair-pad placed under the urinal protects \n                against spills.\n\tAsk your continence nurse specialist or Disabled Living Centre \n                if they will lend you different designs to try. \n\n\n            Hand Held Urinals For Men \n\n            Urinals for men can be basic bottles with a lid and cost as little \n              as £4. With a non-spill adaptor, they may cost up to £14. In choosing \n              a urinal, apart from the general considerations (above) you will \n              wish to take into account the length of your penis. Men with a very \n              small or retracted penis may find some urinals difficult to use. \n              Extending the fly opening of your trousers down to the crotch seam \n              will make positioning the urinal easier, especially if it is to \n              be used when seated. \n\n              \n               \n\n            The standard male bottle is familiar to many people. A snap-on \n              lid helps to avoid spillage after use, as does a bedside or chair-side \n              holder. A version with a flatter bottom is more stable and less \n              easy to spill if placed between the legs in bed. \n\n              \n            \n\n            Non-spill valves will fit into the neck of most standard bottles.\n\n              \n\n              \n            \n\n            The rubber sleeve fits snugly into the neck of the bottle with \n              the air vent upwards. The valve allows urine to pass in but not \n              to return out of the bottle. This is particularly useful for someone \n              who tends to spill or drop a bottle. \n\n            Single-use disposable urinals made from lightweight plastic are \n              easily carried in a pocket or bag for use when out. This can be \n              particularly useful if you are worried about suddenly getting caught \n              short in public \n\n              \n            \n\n            The non-return valve and wire tie enable it to be carried after \n              use until a suitable place is found for disposal. However, as it \n              can only be used once it is rather expensive for routine use, but \n              good for special situations or locations. \n\n            The swan neck urinal \n\n             \n\n            is useful for a man with a small or retracted penis, who has difficulty \n              in using a standard bottle. The whole penis and scrotum can usually \n              fit inside the bottle so that urine is caught at whatever angle \n              it emerges.\n\n             Hand Held Urinals For Women \n\n            Urinals for women are pushed between the legs from the front, or \n              are straddled or sat on. You may need to try several designs to \n              find the easiest for you. Prices vary with type and make, roughly \n              from £4 to £18. \n\n            The choice of urinal depends on your posture when you use it and \n              the positioning technique of the style of urinal. People in wheelchairs \n              may find a U-shape cut-out in the front of a cushion particularly \n              useful. The urinal can be placed in the space left by the U-shaped \n              cut-out and this avoids having to lift the body to any great extent. \n              The Bridge Urinal can be used on its own or connected to a large-capacity \n              drainage bag, as shown here. \n\n             \n\n            Some women construct their own urinals from items such as funnels, \n              tubing and hot water bottles. A narrow, tall jug is useful if you \n              have difficulty in separating your thighs. The pan-type urinal is \n              a shallow plastic dish with a rounded lip for comfort and to prevent \n              spillage. It is emptied via a rubber cap on the handle and can be \n              used in bed or on a chair. Women who cannot raise their buttocks \n              to position it may be able to roll onto it sideways as it is so \n              shallow. Someone who is bed-bound may be able to empty it into a \n              bucket by the bed and reuse it without assistance, thus avoiding \n              waking carers in the night.\n\n            Alternatively a self-adhesive penile sheath can be attached to \n              the handle and connected to a large-capacity drainage bag, which \n              can be discreetly supported underneath or beside the chair or bed. \n            \n\n              \n            \n\n            The female bottle-type urinal (Cygnet) can be used by women in a standing \n            or sitting position or lying on her side: \n              \n            \n\n            while a shallow triangular urinal can be used sitting or prone and \n            has an emptying spout that doubles as a handle: \n              \n            \n             Single-use disposable urinals made from lightweight plastic are \n              also available and are easily carried in a pocket or bag for use \n              when out. This can be particularly useful for those who suddenly \n              get caught short in public.\n\n            Clothing such as split-crotch knickers, wrap-around skirts and \n              similar styles may help with use of a urinal. \n\n             \n\n               \n\n            For further information, see McIntosh J (1998): Female Urinals: \n            Handy Conveniences for Women, from AJ Products, 6, Hollow Road, \n            Elmdon, Saffron Walden, Essex, CB11 4NA. \n            \n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\t \t \n\t \n      \t© The Continence Foundation\tPlease read our disclaimer\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The curriculum and assessment framework in this archive is related to these phases.\n\nThere are four main phases of education in France:\n\n\tPre-compulsory, ages 2 - 6, phase 1\nCompulsory education starts at age 6 and ends at 16 \n\n\tPrimary (known as 'elementary'), ages 6 - 11, phase 2 \n\n\tLower secondary, ages 11 - 15, phase 3 \n\n\tUpper secondary, ages 15 - 18 (only the first year of upper secondary education is compulsory)23 \n\n\n3.2.1 First phase: Pre-compulsory, age 2 - 6\n\nPre-compulsory, pre-school education constitutes the:\n\n\tFirst learning cycle\nand year one of the   \tChildren aged 2-5\n\n\tBasic learning cycle\tChildren aged 5-6\n\n\nPre-compulsory pre-school education is now called pre-elementary education in France (enseignement préélémentaire) to underline that this stage precedes the elementary (primary) stage and is in itself part of the education system leading to university.61\n\nPre-compulsory education is optional between the ages of 2 and 6, that is to say that parents have a right to ask for it, although for 2-year-olds it may not always be available.61 Under Article 2 of the 1989 Framework Law on Education,7 however, a place must be made available for any 3-year-old child whose family requests it, either in a nursery school (école maternelle) or an infant class (classe enfantine) attached to a/in an elementary school, as near as possible to his/her home. The Law also states that priority should be given to providing school places for 2-year-olds living in socially underprivileged places such as inner city, rural or mountainous areas.10\n\nAttendance at public-sector nursery schools is free of charge, and funded by central government, through the commune. They are co-educational and non-denominational. In private-sector nursery schools, parents pay school fees. 23,54\n\nNursery schooling is the responsibility of the national Ministry of Education, although local authorities are responsible for providing non-teaching staff, lunch and supervision during the break in the middle of the day.10\n\nDaycare facilities also exist for 0- to 3-year-olds. These are well-developed in terms of ratios and trained staff and are available for the majority of parents. The tax system favours this, as do means-tested charges. Crèches collectives, registered childminders (nourrices) and haltes garderies (where a child can be left for short periods) come under the authority of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Daycare is not only used to facilitate the employment of women, but also to socialise children. Non-working mothers often use haltes garderies and childminders as part of early years development.61\n\nJardins d'enfants, where available, also offer care for 2- to 6-year-olds, so there is some choice between childcare and education for this age group. The staff ratio is 1:8 and parents pay.61\n\nWhere pre-elementary provision is not provided by one of the forms of daycare or childcare listed above, or in a specific nursery school or infant class, alternative forms of provision may be offered in:\n\n\t'infants sections' which are integrated into elementary schools. These take children aged 5 and, in some cases, with the permission of the National Education Inspector and where places and teaching organisation allow, children aged 4 may also be admitted; \n\n\tinter-commune nursery schools. These provide a solution for several communes which join together to provide a sufficient number of children to open a nursery class; \n\n\thalf-time classes, offered either as half days or for one day in two. This formula allows children to receive the essential grounding in early education. They spend the rest of the time in the family; \n\n\t'ambulatory' (peripatetic) classes for sparsely populated areas, with scattered housing. Nursery schools and infant classes in rural or mountainous areas are provided with assistance from mobile teams for organisation and academic liaison. A school teacher or elementary school teacher in a lorry equipped with audio-visual material and teaching documents makes regular trips around the small, isolated schools in the sector for which it is responsible.26 \n\n\nFrance has a long tradition of providing pre-school education and, for this reason, more than 99 per cent of children aged 3 attend school. The attendance rate for 2-year-olds has recently stabilised at around 36 per cent, 23, 55 and all French 4- and 5-year-olds are currently attending some form of pre-elementary provision.10\n\n3.2.1.1 Admissions criteria\n\nChildren who have reached the age of 2 by the first day of the school year (1 September)23 (and possessing the physiological and psychological maturity and state of health compatible with the group conditions characteristic of the school environment),58 can be admitted to nursery schools and infant classes if space is available.23 Children whose second birthday occurs between the first day of school and December 31 of that same calendar year may exceptionally be accepted under the same conditions.58 An effort is made to give priority to nursery school places in socially-disadvantaged areas (see below). In accordance with Article 2 of the Framework Law on Education of 1989,7 at age 3, every child should be able to attend a nursery school or an infant class as close as possible to his/her home at the request of his/her family. 23,10\n\nThe Framework Law on Education of 1989 also states that priority should be given to providing school places for 2-year-olds living in socially underprivileged places such as inner city, rural or mountainous areas. The Ministry of Education has designated certain geographical areas 'education priority zones' (zones d'éducation prioritaires or ZEPs). Children in these zones are offered, where possible, maternelle education from age 2 for social reasons, e.g. to learn French in preparation for the school system. Children with special educational needs and foreign children are also offered places in pre-elementary education at age 2, where conditions allow, in order to facilitate their integration as quickly as possible. 84.7 per cent of 2-year-olds in education priority zones attend écoles maternelles compared with around 35 per cent in the rest of France. 61,10\n\nIn the absence of a nursery school or an infant class, children aged 5, for whom parents request school admission, are admitted to the infant section in an elementary school (école élémentaire) and enter the basic learning cycle, see section 3.2.2. 31\n\nParents must register their children at their local town hall (mairie) for entry to an école maternelle. Places are then allocated on a strictly geographical/sectorial basis and there is generally no parental choice. There are, however, in Paris in particular, many demands by parents for transfer to more socially or academically desirable schools (demandes de dérogation), suggesting a lack of satisfaction with allocation criteria. These requests are common at pre-compulsory, primary, secondary and university levels. If the parents of a pre-compulsory or primary age child would prefer their child to attend a school other than that of their place of residence, but still within their commune, they must ask their mayor for permission to change school sectors. If they choose a school in another commune, they must apply to the mayor of that commune, who may allow the change on condition that the permission of the mayor of the commune of residence is obtained. 61,26\n\nOnce parents have requested that their child be able to attend nursery school and the local mairie has given its permission, the headteacher enrols the child once the following documents have been supplied:\n\n\tbirth certificate; \n\n\thealth certificate from the family doctor; \n\n\thealth records providing proof that the child has received the compulsory vaccinations for his age; \n\n\tan enrolment certificate which is provided by the mayor of the commune in which the school is situated.26 \n\n\n3.2.1.2 Length of school year (in days) and day (in hours)\n\nSchool week and day\n\nNursery schooling is usually attended on a full-time basis, that is for about eight hours a day and nursery schools in France (écoles maternelles) are mostly open more than seven or eight hours a day, but only in term-time.80 (Term time usually consists of 36 weeks of classes throughout the school year.)22 Half-time classes are, however, available in some areas of the country and, where children attend full-time, many still have an afternoon 'siesta' up to age 6.\n\nSchools usually close on Wednesday, as well as on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday.22\n\nChildren in pre-compulsory education generally have 26 hours of lessons per week. 23,27\n\nSchool holidays\n\nThe Minister for National Education determines the dates of school holidays in each of the three zones in metropolitan France. There are three distinct zones - A, B and C - to ensure staggered holidays. 23,26 \n\nGenerally, the three-term school year starts in early September and the first holiday period (a little over a week) is generally around November (All Saints' holiday), followed by a second, of two weeks, over Christmas and the New Year. These holidays are identical for the three zones. The beginning of the winter holiday (some ten days) is then staggered according to zone, over the month of February. The spring holidays last for two weeks in April and the summer holidays are virtually the same for the three zones and begin at the end of June. (There is a special calendar for Corsica and the overseas départements.)26 \n\nFrench school term dates are approved by the Higher National Education Council, but may be modified to take local circumstances into account. Term dates are based on the following approach:\n\n\tThe definition of the optimum lengths of time children need to spend working and resting. \n\n\tThey also bear in mind the recommendations of experts, the experience of teachers and children, and the constraints of the current operation of the school system. The objective is to maintain a regular level of study throughout the year.10 \n\n\nDetails of the school term dates are available online: http://www.education.gouv.fr/prat/calendrier/calendrier.php \n\nThe school holiday information for the period also confirms that:\n\n\tAll teachers start the school year two days before students. \n\n\tAll classes finish at the end of June and do not encroach into July.  125    \n\n\nThe first term of the French school year (late August/early September to December) is seen by some to very long and hard.  In early 2002, the Ministry of Education decided to reopen the debate on the organisation of the school year.  These new discussions aimed to create a school year which is characterised by increased balance between study periods and holidays.  In the first instance and, as an indication of this, it was announced that, with effect from the 2002-2003 school year, the first holiday period of the year (October half-term, known as \"Toussaint\") would be extended to last for ten days and cover two full weekends.  As a result, the autumn term (late August/early September to December) now generally comprises two seven-week periods separated by ten days' holiday.138   \n\n3.2.2 Second phase: Primary, age 6 - 11\n\nState-funded primary schools (known as elementary schools/écoles élémentaires) cater for children aged 6 to 11. Attendance is compulsory and free of charge, and the education provided is co-educational and secular.23\n\nElementary schools comprise five classes divided into two cycles:\n\n\tthe basic learning cycle which begins in the upper section (last year) of nursery school (children aged 5-6) and continues in the first two years of elementary school; and \n\n\tthe consolidation cycle which covers the final three years (CE2, CM1 and CM2) of elementary school before admission to the collège. (CE2 = Cours Elémentaire 2, CM1 = Cours Moyen 1, CM2 = Cours Moyen 2).28 \n\n\nThe organisation of primary education presents particular problems in sparsely-populated areas such as rural and mountainous regions. Schools are therefore sometimes restructured in such areas with children from several communes being grouped together, or children at different levels of education being grouped together.28\n\n3.2.2.1 Admissions criteria\n\nChildren start école élémentaire in the September of the calendar year when they become 6.26\n\nSchool places are generally allocated on a strictly geographical/sectorial basis and, as a rule, parents are required to enrol their children in the school area in which they live. Exceptions can, however, be granted, allowing parents to send their children to another school of their choice. In Paris, in particular, there are many demands by parents for transfer to more socially or academically desirable schools (demandes de dérogation), suggesting a lack of satisfaction with allocation criteria. These requests are common at pre-compulsory, primary, secondary and university levels. If the parents of a pre-compulsory or primary age child would prefer their child to attend a school other than that of their place of residence, but still within their commune, they must ask their mayor for permission to change school sectors. If they choose a school in another commune, they must apply to the mayor of that commune, who may allow the change on condition that the permission of the mayor of the commune of residence is obtained. 23,61,26\n\nThere is generally no participation by headteachers regarding admissions. The entire process is carried out by officials at the académie (the regional educational headquarters). The criteria used are ranked in order and applied to the list of applicants for each school until the number of places available is filled.11\n\n3.2.2.2 Length of school year (in days) and day (in hours)\n\nSchool year/week/day\n\nAt primary level, the school week is organised by the inspecteur d'académie (the director of département services for national education), although (both in primary and secondary education) school starting and finishing times may be modified by the mayor of the locality (dependent on the local situation). There are usually 180 days, or 36 weeks, of classes in the school year (between September and June) and elementary school children have, since 1992, attended classes for 26 hours per week (usually 26 one-hour lessons). 23,26 The annual minimum number of teaching hours is 846.25\n\nSchools are usually open six days a week (Monday-Saturday), but no classes are held on Wednesdays or on Saturday afternoons. However, the local inspecteur d'académie may modify the weekly timetable, at the request of the majority of the members of the school governing board and after consultation with the recteur. However, any changes may not shorten the number of teaching hours in the school year (the minimum is 846), nor their allocation to the groups of subjects as determined by the national Ministry of Education, see section 5.2.2.25,26 Consequently, increasing numbers of schools, 25 per cent at the most recent assessment,133  are opting for a four-day (as opposed to the traditional four-and-a-half-day) week. That is, children in these schools attend all day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, cutting out the Saturday half-day. The missing hours are usually made up by shortening the school holidays.85\n\nSchool holidays\n\nThe school calendar is fixed by the Minister for National Education, who also determines the dates of school holidays in each of the three zones in metropolitan France. There are three distinct zones (A, B and C) to ensure staggered holidays.26\n\nGenerally, the three-term school year starts in early September and the first holiday period (a little over a week) is generally around November (All Saints' holiday), followed by a second, of two weeks, over Christmas and the New Year. These holidays are identical for the three zones. The beginning of the winter holiday (some ten days) is then staggered according to zone, over the month of February. The spring holidays last for two weeks in April and the summer holidays are virtually the same for the three zones and begin at the end of June. (There is a special calendar for Corsica and the overseas départements.)26\n\nFrench school term dates are approved by the Higher National Education Council, but may be modified to take local circumstances into account. Term dates are based on the following approach:\n\n\tThe definition of the optimum lengths of time children need to spend working and resting. \n\n\tThey also bear in mind the recommendations of experts, the experience of teachers and children, and the constraints of the current operation of the school system. The objective is to maintain a regular level of study throughout the year.10 \n\n\nDetails of the school term dates are available online: http://www.education.gouv.fr/prat/calendrier/calendrier.php \n\nThe school holiday information for the period also confirms that:\n\n\tAll teachers start the school year two days before students. \n\n\tAll classes finish at the end of June and do not encroach into July.  \n\n\tAll elementary school students begin the school year on Thursdays. 125  \n\n\nThe first term of the French school year (late August/early September to December) is seen by some to very long and hard.  In early 2002, the Ministry of Education decided to reopen the debate on the organisation of the school year.  These new discussions aimed to create a school year with more balance between study periods and holidays.  In the first instance and, as an indication of this, it was announced that, with effect from the 2002-2003 school year, the first holiday period of the year (October half-term, known as \"Toussaint\") would be extended to last for ten days and cover two full weekends.  As a result, the autumn term (late August/early September to December) now generally comprises two, seven-week periods separated by ten days' holiday.138   \n\n3.2.3 Third phase: Lower secondary, age 11 - 15\n\nIn secondary education (lower and upper), classes are numbered downwards from six (sixième) up to one (première) and the final year of Baccalauréat studies is called terminale.\n\nSecondary education begins in the collège. This is a comprehensive institution admitting all students for the first four years of compulsory lower secondary education; students aged 11 to 15 in the sixième, cinquième, quatrième and troisième classes. (Secondary education then continues in a general and technological lycée (LEGT) or a vocational lycée (lycée professionnel, LP), offering upper secondary education for students aged 15+ to around the age of 18, for whom only the first year, the seconde is compulsory, see 3.2.4 for further details).23\n\nCollèges are local authority public-sector schools with legal and financial autonomy. The education provided is free, co-educational and secular.23\n\nThere are some specialist collège options, as follows:\n\nSports sections\n\nCreated in 1974, sports sections offer gifted students a timetable enabling them to pursue their normal collège classes in order to obtain their qualifications, while at the same time providing them with the physical training required if they are to practise their sport at high level and participate in competitions. There are two levels of recruitment into the various categories of sports sections: at national level, athletes belonging or likely to belong to French national teams are grouped together; at regional level, a pool of talent which participates in regional events and can also supply the national level is grouped together.26\n\nBilingual sections\n\nThere are French/German, French/English, French/Spanish, French/Italian, French/Russian and French/Portuguese sections in some collèges (and lycées). These are characterised by more intensive practice in the language (extra hours of modern language teaching in addition to the mandatory hours) and progressive teaching in the section language in one of the following subjects: art, music, physical education and sport, and technology.26\n\nInternational sections\n\nThere are French/English, French/American, French/German, French/Italian, French/Spanish, French/Portuguese, French/Swedish and French/Dutch sections in certain establishments. The teaching in international sections is aimed at facilitating integration of foreign students into the French education system and training French students in advanced practice of a foreign language, particularly by using this language in certain subjects. In international sections, teaching is by French and foreign teachers.26\n\nEuropean sections\n\nEuropean sections aim to offer students in secondary education additional training in a European language, in order to bring them to a very high standard and to teach them about the culture of the country or countries in which the language is spoken. The sections, which exist in collèges and lycées, are created in volunteer schools nominated by the recteur; no special Education Ministry funding/subsidy is provided. 26  In the school year 2001 - 2002 there were just over 2,500 European sections, of which 134 were in vocational lycées.   Further information on European sections is available at:\n\n\nhttp://www.education.gouv.fr/presse/2002/europ/europdp.htm \n\n\nCollège reforms\n\nWide-ranging reforms of lower secondary education were announced in 2001. Despite some calls for a return to vocational streams in collèges, it was determined that the comprehensive principle would remain, but that the curriculum would be adapted to suit the wide-ranging abilities of students, aged 11 to 15 , and to fight school failure. It was further decided that subject options would introduce a vocational element. The changes, which were introduced progressively from autumn 2001, incorporated:\n\n\timprovements to the integration of students arriving from elementary school; \n\n\tmulti-disciplinary studies for the two middle years of the collège (the cinquième and the quatrième, students aged 12-14) around the themes of nature and the human body, arts and humanities, languages and civilisations, and design and technical studies; \n\n\tfinal year collège students (aged 14-15, in the troisième) being offered vocationally-orientated options to complement the core curriculum;  \n\n\tformal assessments every year; and \n\n\tgreater value given to the end-of-collège  exam and certificate (the diplôme national du brevet) [see section 6.3]. 118   \n\n\n \n\n3.2.3.1 Admissions criteria\n\nGenerally, children who complete normal school attendance are promoted automatically from elementary school to the first class of secondary school (the sixième of the collège), at the latest in their twelfth year of age, providing there is no objection from their teacher/s. There is no elementary school leaving examination.28 Those children who have not acquired the basic skills/competencies of primary education may be admitted to a specialised teaching section (SES), by decision of the département commission for special educational needs (CDES).26 For further information on publicly-funded provision for students with special needs, see the supplement to this Archive, \"France: special educational provision\". Simply click on the 'special education' button at the top of this page.\n\nSchool places are generally allocated on a strictly geographical/sectorial basis and, as a rule, parents are required to enrol their children in the school area in which they live. Exceptions can, however, be granted, allowing parents to send their children to another school of their choice. In Paris, in particular, there are many demands by parents for transfer to more socially or academically desirable schools (demandes de dérogation), suggesting a lack of satisfaction with allocation criteria. These requests are common at pre-compulsory, primary, secondary and university levels. 23,61 The most frequently cited reasons for transfer requests are a brother or sister already at the collège in question, the vicinity of home, an unusual foreign language or a European education section with increased foreign language provision offered by the collège in question, or the location of parents' work. A small number of teachers also request that their child be placed in the school in which they teach.11      On average, around seven in ten children attend a collège in the geographical/sectorial area in which they live (their local catchment area), two out of ten children attend a private school, and one in ten attends a publicly-funded school in a different geographical region.130\n\nIn rural areas, the catchment areas or sectors to which students are allocated for lower secondary education are often composed of several communes: that in which the collège is located is then known as the chief commune of the sector. In urban areas, a collège catchment area is often part of a commune. Where the collège in the sector only offers certain subjects (such as certain modern foreign languages), the family may request permission to enrol the student in another collège offering additional subjects/foreign languages. The final decision on transfer is taken by the inspecteur d'académie (the director of educational services for the département).26\n\nThere is generally no participation by headteachers regarding admissions. The entire process is carried out by officials at the académie (the regional educational headquarters). The criteria used are ranked in order and applied to the list of applicants for each school until the number of places available is filled.11\n\nFamilies must enter into a contract with the school to which their child is sent and, to complete enrolment proceedings, must decide whether to buy the child school meals or not and decide what modern foreign language the child wishes to learn. If a child wishes to enter collège from a private school under contract to the State (sous contrat), admission to the sixième is granted by the académie inspector. This is, of course, dependent on the private elementary school's decision to allow the student to be promoted up a class from primary to lower secondary education. Children from private schools, which are not under contract to the State, or educated in the family, must sit an entrance examination. The necessary application forms are distributed by the académie inspector.26\n\n3.2.3.2 Length of school year (in days) and day (in hours)\n\nSchool year/week/day\n\nIn lower secondary education, the governing board of each collège organises the school week in its own way, but within government guidelines and in accordance with the recommendation that subject areas are distributed evenly. Schools are usually open six days a week (Monday to Saturday), but classes are not usually provided on Wednesdays or on Saturday afternoon.  However, the local inspecteur d'académie may modify the weekly timetable, at the request of the majority of the members of the school governing board and after consultation with the recteur. However, any changes may not shorten the number of teaching hours in the school year (the minimum is 846), nor their allocation to the groups of subjects as determined by the national Ministry of Education, see section 5.2.2.25,150 This means that some schools have begun to transfer classes to Wednesday morning whilst leaving Saturdays free.23,26   In addition, increasing numbers of schools, 25 per cent at the most recent assessment,133  are opting for a four-day (as opposed to the traditional four-and-a-half-day) week. That is, students in these schools attend all day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, cutting out the Saturday half-day. The missing hours are usually made up by shortening the school holidays.85\n\nNormally, there are 180 days or 36 weeks of classes in the school year and lower secondary class hours usually comprise 55 minutes of teaching and a five-minute break between classes. Students in collège usually have between three and six, 55-minute classes during the school day (or between 25.5 and 30 hours of 55-minute lessons per week, with three additional hours for students who have fallen behind or for optional subjects). (Further details are provided in section 5.3.2.) The annual minimum number of taught hours at lower secondary level is 842. Students are admitted to the school ten minutes before the beginning of classes. 23,25,171\n\nSchool holidays\n\nThe school calendar is fixed by the Minister for National Education, who also determines the dates of school holidays in each of the three zones in metropolitan France. There are three distinct zones (A, B and C) to ensure staggered holidays.   26 \n\nGenerally, the three-term school year starts in early September and the first holiday period (a little over a week) is generally around November (All Saints' holiday), followed by a second, of two weeks, over Christmas and the New Year. These holidays are identical for the three zones. The beginning of the winter holiday (some ten days) is then staggered according to zone, over the month of February. The spring holidays last for two weeks in April and the summer holidays are virtually the same for the three zones and begin at the end of June. (There is a special calendar for Corsica and the overseas départements.) 26 \n\nFrench school term dates are approved by the Higher National Education Council, but may be modified to take local circumstances into account. Term dates are based on the following approach:\n\n\tThe definition of the optimum lengths of time children need to spend working and resting. \n\n\tThey also bear in mind the recommendations of experts, the experience of teachers and children, and the constraints of the current operation of the school system. The objective is to maintain a regular level of study throughout the year.10 \n\n\nDetails of the school term dates are available online: http://www.education.gouv.fr/prat/calendrier/calendrier.php \n\nThe school holiday information for the period also confirms that:\n\n\tAll teachers start the school year two days before students. \n\n\tAll classes finish at the end of June and do not encroach into July. 125  \n\n\nThe first term of the French school year (late August/early September to December) is seen by some to very long and hard. In early 2002, the Ministry of Education reopened the debate on the organisation of the school year. These new discussions aimed to create a school year with more balance between study periods and holidays.  In the first instance and, as an indication of this, since the 2002-2003 school year, the first holiday period of the year (October half-term, known as \"Toussaint\") has been extended to last for ten days and cover two full weekends. As a result, the autumn term (late August/early September to December) now generally comprises two, seven-week periods separated by ten days' holiday.138   \n\n3.2.4 Fourth phase: Upper secondary, age 15 - 18\n\nOn completion of their course of study at the collège, students must attend school full-time for at least one more year to satisfy the compulsory schooling requirement. They generally do this either in a general and technological lycée (lycée d'enseignement général et technologique, LEGT) or in a vocational lycée (lycée professionnel, LP).173\n\nConsequently, the upper secondary phase caters for the final year of compulsory education (students aged 15+) and for the post-compulsory phase, age 16 - 18+. The classes are named seconde (final year of compulsory education, students aged 15-16), première (16-17) and terminale (17-18). The seconde is a 'determination' cycle. It is a class for undifferentiated general and technological education at the end of which students choose between several branches and specialise in some subjects. The première and terminale prepare students for the Baccalauréat (required for entry to higher education). In the première and terminale, students are divided up among different classes according to the type of Baccalauréat, or the subjects, they have chosen to specialise in. Teaching is no longer common to all students, but adapted and strengthened in the subjects which are specific to each Baccalauréat type.26\n\nGeneral and technological lycées, and vocational lycées are local public-sector schools with legal and financial autonomy.23 The financial and administrative organisation, the decision-making and consultation structures, and the provisions concerning the organisation of the school day are the same in lycées as in collèges. Lycées are secular and co-educational, and provision is free of charge.23\n\nGeneral and technological lycées\n\nGeneral and technological lycées (lycées d'enseignement général et technologique, LEGT) are co-educational secondary schools, which usually prepare students in three years for one of the following certificates:\n\n\tthe general Baccalauréat, \n\n\tthe technological Baccalauréat, or \n\n\tthe technical certificate (brevet de technicien) (or the secondary school leaving certificate - the certificat de fin d'études secondaires).23 \n\n\nVocational lycées\n\nVocational lycées (lycées professionnels, LPs, or lycées d'enseignement professionnel, LEPs) provide courses of varying duration to prepare students for the following:\n\n\t the vocational Baccalauréat, \n\n\t the vocational studies certificate (brevet d'études professionnelles - BEP), or \n\n\tthe vocational aptitude certificate (certificat d'aptitude professionnelle - CAP).23 \n\n\nLycées des métiers\n\nAs part of the Government’s current drive towards increasing the importance of vocational education at this level, there are proposals to introduce new lycées des métiers. These would specialise in one trade or profession at all levels from the lowest certificate to university-level degrees. (See section 1.2.2. for further information.)\n\nThere are also some specialist lycée options, as follows:\n\nBilingual sections\n\nThere are at present French/German, French/English, French/Spanish, French/Italian, French/Russian and French/Portuguese sections in some collèges and lycées. These are characterised by more intensive practice in the language (extra hours of teaching in addition to the mandatory hours ) and progressive teaching in the section language in one of the following subjects: art, music, physical education and sport, and technology.26\n\nInternational sections\n\nThere are French/English, French/American, French/German, French/Italian, French/Spanish, French/Portuguese, French/Swedish and French/Dutch sections in certain establishments. The teaching in international sections is aimed at facilitating integration of foreign students into the French education system and training French students in advanced practice of a foreign language, particularly by using this language in certain subjects. In international sections, teaching is by French and foreign teachers.26\n\nEuropean sections\n\nThe purpose of European sections is to offer students in secondary education additional training in a European language, in order to bring them to a very high standard and to teach them about the culture of the country or countries in which the language is spoken. The sections are created in volunteer collèges and lycées nominated by the recteur; no special Education Ministry funding/subsidy is provided.26  In the school year 2001 - 2002, there were just over 2,500 European sections, of which 134 were in vocational lycées. Further information on European sections is available at:\n\n\nhttp://www.education.gouv.fr/presse/2002/europ/europdp.htm\n\n\n3.2.4.1 Admissions criteria\n\nEach school district offers students a choice between lycées of general and technological education (LEGTs), and vocational lycées when they leave the troisième. Collège/troisième leavers then usually attend lycées in their local school district/geographical catchment area, except if the option or speciality they have chosen requires moving to a more distant institution.23,26\n\nParents are generally expected to enrol their children in a lycée in their local school area unless, for example, their family opts for private-sector education or, if the specialisation chosen during the troisième (final year) of collège (for example, a foreign language not included at the local school), involves attending an institution further away.23 This is, in fact, a means by which some parents \"work\" the system in order to ensure that their child is enrolled in their preferred school. For example, if they know that the lycée they would prefer their child to attend is the only one within striking distance offering Latin, they will ensure that their child selects Latin as a chosen specialisation on completion of the troisième.77\n\nThe most frequently cited reasons for requests for transfer to a lycée outside the student's own school district are a brother or sister already at the lycée; the vicinity of home; an unusual foreign language or a European education section with increased foreign language provision offered by the lycée in question; and the location of parents' work. A small number of teachers also ask for their child to be placed in the school in which they teach.11\n\nThere is generally no participation by headteachers regarding admissions. The entire process is carried out by officials at the académie (the regional educational headquarters). The criteria used are ranked in order and applied to the list of applicants for each school until the number of places available is filled.11\n\nAdmission to publicly-funded lycée education is usually automatic on completion of lower secondary education in the collège. However, those students who have not attended a public-sector lower secondary school must usually take an entrance examination.24\n\n3.2.4.2 Length of school year (in days) and day (in hours)\n\nSchool year/week/day\n\nThere are normally 36 weeks (180 days) of classes in the school year and the school week is organised by the governing board, following national recommendations.26 Schools are usually open six days a week (Monday to Saturday), but classes are not usually provided on Wednesdays or on Saturday afternoon.  However, the local inspecteur d'académie may modify the weekly timetable, at the request of the majority of the members of the school governing board and after consultation with the recteur.  Any changes may not shorten the number of teaching hours in the school year (the minimum is 846), nor their allocation to the groups of subjects as determined by the national Ministry of Education, see section 5.2.2.25,26 This means that some schools have begun to transfer classes to Wednesday morning whilst leaving Saturdays free.23,26   In addition, increasing numbers of schools, 25 per cent at the most recent assessment,133  are opting for a four-day (as opposed to the traditional four-and-a-half-day) week. That is, students in these schools attend all day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, cutting out the Saturday half-day. The missing hours are usually made up by shortening the school holidays.85\n\nThe weekly timetable for upper secondary education (the seconde, première and terminale classes) in LEGTs, usually ranges between 29.5 and 31.5 hours, depending on the options selected by the student.23 Teaching takes place in 55-minute periods with five-minute breaks between each period.23 In vocational lycées, there are 31 to 36 hours of classes per week.26\n\nSchool holidays\n\nThe school calendar is fixed by the Minister for National Education, who also determines the dates of school holidays in each of the three zones in metropolitan France. There are three distinct zones (A, B and C) to ensure staggered holidays.\n\nGenerally, the three-term school year starts in early September and the first holiday period (a little over a week) takes place around late October/early November (All Saints' holiday), followed by a second, of two weeks, over Christmas and the New Year. These holidays are identical for the three zones. The beginning of the winter holiday (some ten days) is then staggered according to zone, over the month of February. The spring holidays last for two weeks in April and the summer holidays are virtually the same for the three zones and begin at the end of June. (There is a special calendar for Corsica and the overseas départements.)26 \n\nFrench school term dates are approved by the Higher National Education Council, but may be modified to take local circumstances into account. Term dates are based on the following approach:\n\n\tThe definition of the optimum lengths of time children need to spend working and resting. \n\n\tThey also bear in mind the recommendations of experts, the experience of teachers and children, and the constraints of the current operation of the school system. The objective is to maintain a regular level of study throughout the year.1 \n\n\nDetails of the school term dates are available online: http://www.education.gouv.fr/prat/calendrier/calendrier.php \n\nThe school holiday information for the period also confirms that:\n\n\tAll teachers start the school year two days before students. \n\n\tAll classes finish at the end of June and do not encroach into July. 125  \n\n\nThe first term of the French school year (late August/early September to December) is seen by some to very long and hard.  In early 2002, the Ministry of Education reopened the debate on the organisation of the school year. These discussions aimed to create a school year with more balance between study periods and holidays. In the first instance and, as an indication of this, since the 2002-2003 school year, the first holiday period of the year (October half-term, known as \"Toussaint\") has been extended to last for ten days and cover two full weekends. As a result, the autumn term (late August/early September to December) now generally comprises two, seven-week periods separated by ten days' holiday.138   \n\n \n    \tPrevious\n\tNext\n\tSection Contents\n\n      \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\tCountry Archives\n\t\n      \n       \n        Country archives\n1.Select country\nAustralia\nCanada\nEngland\nFrance\nGermany\nHungary\nIreland\nItaly\nJapan\nKorea\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nNorthern Ireland\nScotland\nSingapore\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nUSA\nWales\nDefinitions\n\n2.Select subject/chapter heading\nIntroduction\nSystem Summary\nContext and principles of education\nOrganisation/control/funding\nEducation Structure (ages 3-19)\nInternal school organisation\nCurricula (age 3-19)\nAssessment arrangements\nInitial Teacher Training\nAppendix\nGrade/year level key\nKeywords\nLinks\nSources\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n        \n        3.Select type of education\nMainstream\nSpecial\n\n\n        \n       \n\n\n      \n\n     \n\tComparative tables\n\tThematic probes\n\tThematic studies\n\tSearch INCA\n\t\n\n\n\n          \n            Search\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n    \n \n\n     \n     \n\n   \n   \n\n \n\n\n\n\tHome\n\tCountry archives\n\tComparative tables\n\tThematic probes\n\tThematic studies\n\tFAQs\n\tNews\n\tAbout INCA\n\tContact INCA\n\n\n \n\n",

Much of the detail to support the UDP policies will be contained in accompanying documents called Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG). These documents can be downloaded in PDF format from this page or you receive printed versions of these by using the order form which can be downloaded from the Unitary Development Plan (UDP) page.\n\nSupplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) is a material consideration for development control purposes, and can take the form of design guides, area development briefs or supplement other specific policies in the UDP.\n\nThey do not form part of the UDP and are not required to follow the same process as the UDP. Planning Policy Guidance 12 stipulates that SPG should be prepared in consultation with the general public, businesses, and other interested parties and their views should be taken into account before it is finalised. It should then be the subject of a council resolution to adopt it as supplementary guidance.\n\nSPG Notes\n\nThe SPG Notes were prepared in parallel with the First Deposit UDP 2003. A public consultation exercise was undertaken on the SPG in September 2003. The Council received 268 representations of objection or support during the consultation period.\n\nAs the SPG were drafted and subject to public consultation prior to the commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, 2004 and are closely linked to the UDP process, the documents can be adopted as Supplementary Planning Guidance. Five of the SPG have been adopted (see adopted SPG section) to bring them in line with the adopted UDP policies, the UDP Inspector���s recommendations and recent changes to Government legislation. The remaining SPG are still draft (see draft SPG section) and will continue to be used for development control purposes in accordance with the Executive resolution in July 2003. These draft SPG are unaffected by the UDP and will be replaced by a programme of Supplementary Planning Documents as part of our LDF. The draft SPG will form part of the evidence base for future SPD preparation.\n\nCodes of Practice\n\nIn addition, two Codes of Practice have been prepared and adopted on employment and training and health planning obligations. The two Codes of Practice Notes will assist in development control negotiations on planning obligations and relate to employment and health impacts of development proposals.\n\nThe Secretary of State will give substantial weight in making decisions on matters that come before him to SPGs which derives out of and is consistent with the development plan, and has been prepared in the proper manner.\n\n |Back to top\n\nAdopted SPG\n\n\tSPG Titile\n\tStatus\n\tFiletype\n\tSize\n\n\tSPG1a Design Guidance\tAdopted 2006 \tPDF\t54KB\n\tSPG3a Density, Dwelling Mix, Floorspace Minima, Conversions, Extensions and Lifetime Homes\tAdopted 2006 \tPDF\t1.5MB\n\tSPG8a Waste and Recycling\tAdopted 2006 \tPDF\t5.3KB\n\tSPG10a The Negotiation, Management and Monitoring of Planning Obligations\tAdopted 2006 \tPDF\t59KB\n\tSPG10b Affordable Housing\tAdopted 2006 \tPDF\t42KB\n\n\n\n\tCodes of Practice Notes\n\tStatus\n\tFiletype\n\tSize\n\n\tPlanning Obligation Code of Practice No 1: Employment and Training\tAdopted 2006\tPDF\t56KB\n\tPlanning Obligation Code of Practice No 2: Health\t Adopted 2006\tPDF\t42KB\n\n\n\n |Back to top\n\nDraft SPG\n\n\tSPG Title\n\tStatus\n\tFiletype\n\tSize\n\n\tSPG 1b - Parking in Front Gardens\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t223 KB\n\tSPG 1c - Strategic Views\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t611 KB\n\tSPG 1d - Telecom Equipment - Including Satellite Dishes\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t37 KB\n\tSPG 2 - Conservation &  Archaeology\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t68 KB\n\tSPG 3b - Privacy, Overlooking, Aspect, Outlook &  Daylight, Sunlight\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t65 KB\n\tSPG 3c - Backlands Development\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t37 KB\n\tSPG 4 - Access for All - Mobility Standards\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t270 KB\n\tSPG 5 - Safety By Design\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t34KB\n\tSPG 6a - Shopfronts, Signage &  Security\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t43KB\n\tSPG 6b ��� Advertisements\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t131 KB\n\tSPG 6c - Restaurants, Hot Food Premises -Use Class A3 ��� etc\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t30 KB\n\tSPG 7a - Vehicle and Pedestrian Movement\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t361 KB\n\tSPG 7b - Travel Plans\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t39 KB\n\tSPG 7c - Transport Assessment\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t8.1 MB\n\tSPG 8b ��� Materials\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t53 KB\n\tSPG 8c - Environmental Performance\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t31 KB\n\tSPG 8d - Biodiversity, Landscaping &  Trees\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t31 KB\n\tSPG 8e - Light Pollution,\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t108 KB\n\tSPG 8f - Land Contamination\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t70 KB\n\tSPG 8g - Ecological Impact Assessment\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t28 KB\n\tSPG 8h - Environmental Impact Assessment\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t28 KB\n\tSPG 8i - Air Quality, \tDraft 2006\tPDF\t138 KB\n\tSPG 9 - Sustainability Statement guidance notes &  Sustainability Checklist\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t35 KB\n89 KB\n\n\tSPG 10c- Educational needs generated by new housing\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t46 KB\n\tSPG 10d - Planning obligations and open space\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t29 KB\n\tSPG 10e - Improvements to public transport infrastructure and services\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t36 KB\n\tSPG 11a - Car repair workshops and garages\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t35 KB\n\tSPG 11b - Buildings Suitable for Community Use\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t44 KB\n\tSPG 11c - Town Centre Retail Thresholds\tDraft 2006\tPDF\t55 KB\n\n\n |Back to top\n\nAddress\nPlanning Policy Team\nUrban Environment\n639 High Road\nTottenham\nLondon N17 8BD\n\nTel: 020 8489 1479\nFax: 020 8489 5552\nEmail: udp@haringey.gov.uk\n\n |Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n |\n\nUpdate Me\n\n\n\n                     ��\n\n\n                        Page Last Updated: 26th July 2007\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        This page belongs to the following categories :\n- Business\n- Transport and streets\n- Environment\n\n                     ��\n\n\n\n\n |\n\n\t   \n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\t  \t\t \n \t\t \n\t  \n\t  \t\n        Main navigation:\n\n\n\n  \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSearch:(Advanced Search)\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  \n\n  \tHome Page\n\tHousing and Planning\tPlanning\tDevelopment Plan (UDP)\n\tSupplementary Planning Guidance\n\tLocal Development Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tHaringey Council\n\nCivic Centre\n\nHigh Road\n\nWood Green\n\nN22 8LE\n\nTel: 020 8489 0000\n\nEmail the Council\n\n.Getting to our offices.\n\n \n\t  \n \n\t      \n\t  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t  \n\t  \n\t   ��\n\n\t\n \n\t\n \n\t  \n\t\n\t\n      ��\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer | Terms and Conditions | About This Site  \n\n\n\n\n |\n |\n |\n |\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t  northgate smc monitor\n\t\n \n\n   \n\n",

The fact that the lectures were\navailable led me to not turn up to class and my own stupidity\nled me to not bother accessing them?

          "REPORT ON COMPLAINT GE-L0067: MR FRANK STRATFORDOn 30 March 2003, the Complaints Commissioner issued a final report on complaint\nGE-L0067 to the complainant and the Financial Services Authority.  The introduction\nand summary to that report is published below.\nFINAL REPORT ON COMPLAINT GE-L0067\n1. Introduction and Summary\n1.1 This is the Final Report of an investigation by the Complaints Commissioner of\ncomplaint reference number GE-L0067 against the Financial Services Authority\n(FSA) and its predecessor body the Personal Investment Authority (PIA). The\ncomplaint has a number of components; it falls in part to be considered under\nthe Transitional Complaints Scheme and in part under the Main Scheme. A\nPreliminary Report was sent to the complainant and to the FSA on 21 February\n2003 and 15 working days were given for submissions to be made to the\nCommissioner thereon. Submissions were received from the complainant and\nfrom the FSA. All the comments made in these submissions have been\nconsidered carefully by the Commissioner in preparing this Final Report.\n1.2 In this report references to the FSA should be taken to include, where\nappropriate, references also to the PIA.\n1.3 The complaint, which was received by the Commissioner on 22 July 2002, has\nfour components.\n(a) First, it concerns the selling of a Free Standing Additional Voluntary\nContribution (FSAVC) taken out in 1993 by the complainant, who was in\npoor health.  In April 1999 the complainant complained to the product\nprovider. He questioned the suitability of such a plan for his needs, as\nopposed to having an AVC with his then employer; he also expressed\nconcern as to why he could not take his FSAVC pension prior to his\nemployers’ pension as he had been led to believe by the sales person\nconcerned that such a plan was fully flexible and could be taken either\nbefore or after the main pension. He complained that, by not being able\nto draw down the pension, he continued to incur charges whilst the fund\nitself was decreasing in value.\n(b) Second, having complained to the product provider in question and,\nsubsequently to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), he raised\nthe matter with the FSA, first in February 2001 and ultimately by way of\na formal letter of complaint in April 2002. He complained that he had not\nreceived a satisfactory response either from the product provider or\nfrom FOS; in doing so, he questioned the effectiveness of the FSA’s\nregulation of the product provider, and specifically regulation in relation\nto rules governing complaints procedures and the Review of FSAVCs.\nFinal Report GE-L0067\n1(c) Third, having made his complaint to the FSA, the complainant\ncomplained that it was not handled in accordance with the Complaints\nScheme procedures and standards.\n(d) Fourth, the complainant questioned the meaning of terminology used in\nhis dealings with the product provider, with FOS and with the FSA:\nnamely the terms “free standing”;  “retirement”; and “regulated by”;  and\ncomplained that he had not had a satisfactory reply from the FSA in this\nregard.\n1.4 The Complaints Commissioner advised the complainant on 23 August 2002\nthat she was not empowered to consider the first component of his complaint,\nwhich was a matter for the product provider and FOS; that she would review\nthe second component to ascertain whether it came within her jurisdiction or\nnot; that she would investigate the third component under the terms of the\nComplaints Scheme; and that she would address the issue of terminology in\nthe course of her investigation.\n1.5 In relation to the second component of the complaint, the Commissioner has, in\nsummary, found as follows.\n(a) On the matter of jurisdiction in relation to that part of the complaint that\nalleges inadequate regulation of an authorised firm in respect of\ncompliance with complaints procedures, the Commissioner considers\nthat this does fall within the scope of the Complaints Scheme, in this\ncase the Transitional Scheme, and thus within her jurisdiction. The\nCommissioner finds, however, that regulation was not inadequate in this\nrespect.  The product provider in question did follow the rules as laid\ndown by the PIA in 1999 on responding to a complaint and, when the\nprovider was not able to conclude the complaint within the eight week\ntime period allowed, did properly advise the complainant that he could\nthen take his complaint to the PIA Ombudsman Bureau. The\nCommissioner notes that, if the complainant had done this at that time,\nhis case would subsequently have been dealt with as a priority.\nHowever, it was, with the benefit of hindsight, unfortunate from the\ncomplainant’s viewpoint that he chose patiently to persevere with his\ncorrespondence with the product provider. As a consequence, when the\nterms of the FSAVC Review were announced in the following year\n(February 2000), because he had not by then actually taken his benefits\n(or died), he did not automatically become a ‘priority’ case; had his case\nbeen defined as a ‘priority’ it would have had to be investigated and\nconcluded within a six month period.\n(b) On the matter of jurisdiction in relation to that part of the complaint\nalleging inadequate regulation in relation to the FSAVC Review,\nalthough the Complaints Scheme explicitly excludes complaints which\nrelate to the performance of the FSA’s legislative functions, including\nmaking rules and issuing codes and general guidance such as that\nrelating to the FSAVC Review, the Commissioner considers that she\ndoes have jurisdiction over the way in which the FSA oversaw the\nimplementation of the FSAVC Review. The FSA made policy decisions\nas to the necessity for the Review and, after consultation, gave\nguidance to firms as to how it should be undertaken and these are not\nmatters that fall within the scope of the Complaints Scheme. But\nFinal Report GE-L0067\n2allegations that the FSA failed to monitor the Review in an expeditious,\neconomic, fair and transparent manner, which is the essence of this\npart of this complaint, do fall within the scope of the Scheme, in this\ncase the Transitional Scheme, and thus the jurisdiction of the\nCommissioner. Having examined these allegations carefully, however,\nthe Commissioner considers, notwithstanding the complainant’s view to\nthe contrary, that the FSA did put in place an overarching regime for the\nReview that was, in general, timely, cost-effective, fair and well-\nmanaged, and open and transparent. Further, when advised by the\ncomplainant of the delays he was experiencing in obtaining a response\nfrom the product provider, the FSA responded promptly, with the\nconsequence that the provider did then address the complainant’s case.\nBut the selected approach to the Review did have some consequences\nthat, in the Commissioner’s view, could have been avoided, thus\nbenefiting the complainant and others in his position. Whilst\nappreciating that priority cases by necessity must be narrowly defined,\nusing clear and objective criteria, the Commissioner considers that the\nReview might with benefit have recognised explicitly that consumers\nwho had already asked about taking their benefits represented,\npotentially, a priority group alongside those who had actually taken their\nbenefits. Such a group of consumers could have been clearly and\nobjectively defined, and this would have pulled into the ‘priority’ class\nthe complainant, together with others in a similar situation.\n(c) The Commissioner observes that, additionally, there were very\nconsiderable delays in completing the Review in this case. These\ndelays were primarily down to the product provider. Over two years\nelapsed before the product provider made an offer to the complainant.\nHowever, when the provider eventually made an offer, it only addressed\nthe mis-selling of the FSAVC. It failed to address the complainant’s\nconcern that he was sold a policy that was inflexible and therefore not\nsuitable for his circumstances. The offer was, because of this, rejected\nby the complainant.  (It should be noted that the complainant remains\ndissatisfied with this outcome but the Commissioner considers that this\nis not a matter for her but rather for FOS and, perhaps, the Independent\nAssessor.)\n1.6 In relation to the third component of the complaint, the Commissioner finds that\nthe FSA did not comply with its own published procedures and standards in\nrelation to the Complaints Scheme. There were delays in the timetable for\nprocessing the complaint.  The complainant was not notified by the FSA that\nhis complaint would not be considered under Stage 1 of the Scheme until some\nfifty-seven working days after receipt of his letter.  At that point, instead of\nclosing the correspondence, further explanations were sent to the complainant,\nincluding information about the background of the specific regulation\nconcerning FSAVCs, apparently in part because of a misapprehension that the\nScheme rules required this.  The Commissioner appreciates that this was\ndoubtless done in an attempt to be helpful to the complainant but this extra\ncorrespondence, and some of the terminology used in it, had the unfortunate\nconsequence of confusing the complainant as to whether or not his complaint\nwas being handled under Stage 1 of the Scheme and, if not, how was it being\nhandled and what response the FSA had actually made, or was making, to his\ncomplaint.\nFinal Report GE-L0067\n31.7 In relation to the fourth component of the complaint, the Commissioner\nconsiders that clear meanings of the words queried by the complainant in the\ncontext of his complaint should, so far as is possible, have been given to him.\nIn particular, the term “free standing” has caused considerable confusion. The\ncomplainant’s FSAVC policy document clearly states “…You may elect to take\nyour benefits before or after your SRA [Selected Retirement Age] subject to\ncertain conditions.  Early retirement benefits will be calculated in the same way\nas transfer values.”\n1.8 In the light of these findings, the Commissioner recommends as follows.\n(a) In launching future reviews with similar features to the FSAVC Review\nin that they make provision for ‘priority’ cases to be dealt with early on,\nthe FSA should consider carefully the consequences of different options\nwith regard to the precise definition of ‘priority’ cases to be used; in the\ncase of the FSAVC Review this might have resulted in including as\n‘priorities’ those policyholders/investors who had made application to\ntake their benefits as well as those who had actually taken them which,\nin the Commissioner’s view, would have had a more equitable outcome.\n(b) The FSA should provide an apology to the complainant for the failure to\ncomply with the Stage 1 procedures and standards.\n(c) The FSA should review staffing arrangements and workloads in the\narea of complaints handling so that complainants have a timely\nresponse to their enquiries. (The Commissioner understands that this\nhas now been done and additional resources provided).\n(d) The FSA should consider, in conjunction with the Office of the\nCommissioner, improving the clarity of the wording used when\ndescribing the processes and procedures of the Scheme in\ncorrespondence so as to avoid confusion in the minds of complainants.\n(e) A clear response should be given to the complainant by the FSA as to\nits understanding of the words he has queried: namely “free standing”;\n“retirement”; and “regulated by”.\n1.9 The Commissioner understands that the FSA is taking steps to address the\nmatters identified in paragraph 1.8 (d) and (e) above\nFinal Report GE-L0067\n4\n",

Recognising the triggers which cause us to behave non-assertively and developing strategies for dealing with the difficult behaviours we encounter from others is highly beneficial.  Not only does assertiveness help to build or maintain our self-esteem, but can also improve our decision-making ability and possibly our chances of getting what we really want from life.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\n\nYour rights and responsibilities in communication\n\nRecognising different behaviour styles\n\nTechniques for assertively dealing with passive plus high and low aggressive behaviour\n\nMaking and refusing requests\nTechniques for assertively improving your relationships with others\n\n\n  FILENAME \\p  G:\\CSO\\Marketing\\Word Flyers\\2006\\Course Descriptive\\Assertiveness in the Workplace.doc \n\n\n",

Few serious critics of US government policy seek \n      to diminish the many accomplishments of American people in, for example, \n      science, music, art and literature. After all, these achievements include \n      an inspiring tradition of social activism that has led to real improvements \n      in people’s lives, very often won in the face of bitter opposition \n      from business and political elites.\n\n    But the deeper point about “anti-Americanism” has been expressed \n      well by Noam Chomsky:\n\n     \n      “The notion ‘anti-Americanism’ is a revealing one. \n        It is drawn from the lexicon of totalitarianism. Thus people who think \n        that the US is the greatest country in the world are ‘anti-American’ \n        if they criticize the acts of the Holy State, or join the vast majority \n        of the population in believing that the corporate sector has far too much \n        influence over government policy, or regard private corporate institutions \n        created by state power and granted extraordinary rights as ‘a return \n        to feudalism’ (to quote old-fashioned conservatives, a category \n        that now scarcely exists). And so on.” (Interview with Noam Chomsky, \n        Media Bite, May 5, 2007; www.mediabite.org/article_On- \n        the-Media--Anti-Americanism-and- Disparity_393277505.html)\n\n    \n\n    In totalitarian societies, such terms are reflexively used to condemn dissidents \n      as ‘anti-Soviet’ or ‘anti-Russian.’ Chomsky comments:\n\n     \n      “If people who criticize Irish government policies were condemned \n        as ‘anti-Irish,’ I suppose people would collapse in ridicule \n        in the streets of Dublin. At least they should.” (Ibid)\n\n    \n\n    Putting the absurdity of his premise to one side, Webb’s willingness \n      to smooth over the brutal realities of US policy was compounded by his dismissive \n      assertion that “anti-Americans” dwell on the “stains” \n      of the past. Webb told one member of the public who emailed him:\n\n     \n      “Even in conditions where there have been wrongs committed in the \n        past (obviously Latin America is a case in point) there can be a temptation \n        to wallow in the sins of the past rather than accept the good things about \n        a nation which has plainly been successful.” (Email from Justin \n        Webb to Neil Laurenson, April 25, 2007)\n\n    \n\n    He continued:\n\n     \n      “I am talking about the limited but important fact that US companies \n        are successful because they exist within a set of rules and have to pay \n        less attention to dealing with fickle and demanding governments and corrupt \n        individuals... the basic fact to me remains the same -- that this nation \n        is bound by rules. The failure of Latin economies cannot just be the result \n        of US intervention. And in the US something after all must be responsible \n        for its incredible economic success and I suspect that is what it is; \n        a culture that respects law.” (Ibid.)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n      The Latin American ‘Failure’\n\n    Consider Webb’s two central claims concerning the “failure \n      of Latin economies” and the merits of “a [US] culture that respects \n      law”. \n\n    It would be wrong to deny that there are local, intrinsic problems in Latin \n      America. But it is even more foolish to suggest that US oppression has not \n      been a prime factor in all but crushing that region’s hopes for self-determination. \n    \n\n    The so-called ‘Washington consensus’ – a range of policies \n      demanded by US corporate-dominated institutions, especially the World Bank, \n      the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation – \n      has wrought havoc on countries around the world. Structural Adjustment Programmes \n      and ‘free trade’ treaties have forced many developing countries \n      to orient their economies to the benefit of transnational corporations (TNCs) \n      and investors. \n\n    For instance, a rapid increase in poverty across Latin America in the 1990s \n      coincided with TNCs gaining control of 4000 publicly owned companies. (Stuart \n      Munkton, ‘Venezuela's revolution - giving power to the poor,’ \n      February 16, 2007; http://www.venezuelasolidarity.org/?q=node/104) \n    \n\n    Under pressure from imposed ‘austerity measures’, and the forced \n      opening up of Third World economies, governments have slashed education, \n      public health programmes, social welfare safety nets and environmental measures. \n    \n\n    So why have Third World countries increasingly been targeted by big business \n      in this way? Latin American analyst James Petras points to the “increasing \n      dependence of US corporations on earnings and profits from overseas subsidiaries”. \n      These corporations have benefited from a “predatory foreign policy \n      that pillaged wealth overseas through corrupt privatization programs particularly \n      in the ex-Communist countries, Latin America, and Asia”. \n\n    Latin America has become “one of the central areas for Washington’s \n      imperial expansion and exploitation,” Petras adds. (Petras, ‘Neo \n      Mercantilist Empire in Latin America, Part 1,’ Z Magazine, July/August \n      2001; http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jul01petras.htm)\n\n    All of this is consistent with the testimony of John Perkins, who worked \n      as an “economic hitman” for US corporate power. (‘Ridiculing \n      Chavez – the Media Hit Their Stride,’ Part 2, May 18, 2006; \n      www.medialens.org/alerts/06/060518_ridiculing_chavez_the.php)\n\n    Perkins was first hired by American big business in 1971 to forecast economic \n      growth in Third World countries, including Latin America. It was understood \n      that he would deliberately exaggerate growth forecasts. These bloated forecasts \n      were then used to justify massive international loans to fund giant engineering \n      and construction projects in poor countries – dams, power plants, \n      transport networks, even military bases. Huge profits flowed to US corporations \n      and a small group of controlling elites in Third World countries. \n\n    A fundamental aim of US policy was for these countries to +fail+ to achieve \n      their inflated targets, so ensuring they were unable to repay their loans. \n      Third World leaders then \"become ensnared in a web of debt that ensures \n      their loyalty\". As Perkins writes, this enables powerful US interests \n      to \"draw on them whenever we desire - to satisfy our political, economic, \n      or military needs. In turn, they bolster their political positions by bringing \n      industrial parks, power plants, and airports to their people. The owners \n      of US engineering and construction companies become fabulously wealthy\". \n      (Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Ebury Press, London, 2006, \n      p.xi) \n\n    Ecuador, for example, is required to devote nearly 50 per cent of its national \n      budget to servicing debts with international banks dominated by Washington. \n      This leaves close to nothing for millions of citizens classified as \"dangerously \n      impoverished\". Out of every $100 worth of oil pumped from the Amazon, \n      less than $3 goes to Ecuadorian people dying from lack of food and potable \n      water.\n\n    This is but a tiny sample from the stark reality underlying Webb’s \n      platitudinous comments on “the failure of Latin economies”. \n      The “failure” was expressly designed in Washington to the benefit \n      of US corporate and political elites.\n\n    \n\n      Democracy And The Rule Of Law\n\n    Next, consider Webb’s point that the US is a stickler for “the \n      rule of law”. As has often been observed of great power politics, \n      respect for the rule of law at home tells us nothing about respect for the \n      rule of law in the wider world.\n\n    Webb’s claim is simply unsustainable, transparently so in light of \n      the vast crime that is the Iraq war. The invasion of that country, bringing \n      with it the deaths of approaching one million people, is the supreme war \n      crime: a war of aggression, denounced as “illegal” by Kofi Annan, \n      then secretary-general of the UN. \n\n    Historical examples abound of the US bending, or ignoring, international \n      law. Following the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the respected liberal elder \n      statesman Dean Acheson told the American Society of International Law that \n      no “legal issue” arises when the US responds to a challenge \n      to its “power, position, and prestige”. (Chomsky, Hegemony or \n      Survival, Routledge, 2003, p.14) \n\n    The pattern continues to the present era, and is not restricted to Bush \n      I and II. As Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s Secretary of State, once \n      declared: \n\n     \n      “We will act multilaterally when we can, and unilaterally when \n        we must.” (Robert Jensen, Writing Dissent, Peter Lang Publishing, \n        2001, p.56)\n\n    \n\n    The rhetoric of ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’ is of \n      course forever deployed, with much bandying around of phrases such as “new \n      world order”. Thus, one US official said in September 1991: \n\n     \n      “If you’re going to build any kind of credibility for a new \n        world order, you’ve got to make people accountable to legal procedures, \n        and Saddam’s flaunted every one.” \n\n    \n\n    Around the same time, the US upheld the \"new world order\" by \n      cancelling Nicaragua's $260 million debt to Washington. This was a “reward” \n      to the country for caving in to intense US pressure to drop its $17 billion \n      legal claim, sanctioned by the International Court of Justice, as recompense \n      for US sponsorship of the Contra attacks of the 1980s. \n\n    Bear in mind, too, that the US has repeatedly blocked UN efforts to resolve \n      the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 2002, for example, Washington boycotted \n      a conference in Geneva of the High Contracting Parties of the Geneva Conventions \n      called to review the situation in the occupied territories. Chomsky observed:\n\n     \n      “The boycott yielded the usual ‘double veto’: the decisions \n        are blocked, and the events are barely reported and erased from history. \n        The conference reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention \n        to the occupied territories, so that many US-Israeli actions there are \n        war crimes under US law.” (Chomsky, Hegemony or Survival, op. cit, \n        p.177)\n\n    \n\n    Webb, who claims the strict US observance of the “rule of law”, \n      had nothing to say on any of this.\n\n    And what are we to make of Webb’s grandiose assertion in closing \n      his BBC radio series, that the United States “has done more than any \n      other on the face of the Earth to democratise life on this planet”? \n    \n\n    The claim was characteristic of the series as a whole: big claims of benevolent \n      intent based on wishful thinking, with a blind eye turned to a mountain \n      of factual counter-evidence.\n\n    The most obvious point to make in response is that the United States has \n      done a poor job of democratising life in the United States! On the eve of \n      the 2000 presidential elections, a large majority of the electorate dismissed \n      them as an extravaganza run by rich contributors, party managers, and the \n      PR industry. More than 60 per cent of regular voters - that is, the people \n      who even bother to vote - felt that “politics in America is generally \n      pretty disgusting”. The director of Harvard’s Vanishing Voter \n      Project reported that “Americans’ feeling of powerlessness has \n      reached an alarming high”. (Chomsky, Failed States, Hamish Hamilton, \n      2006, p.223)\n\n    In their February 2005 analysis of the sources of US foreign policy, Lawrence \n      Jacob and Benjamin Page found that the major influence was “internationally \n      oriented business corporations,” with a secondary effect of “experts \n      (who, however, may themselves be influenced by business)”. (Ibid., \n      p.235)\n\n    Public opinion, by contrast, had “little or no significant effect \n      on government officials”. (Ibid)\n\n    Turning abroad, Thomas Carothers, director of the Democracy and Rule of \n      Law Project at the Carnegie Endowment, has found a “strong line of \n      continuity” running through US government policy in Latin America \n      in the post-Cold War era; namely: \n\n     \n      “Where democracy appears to fit in well with US security and economic \n        interests, the United States promotes democracy. Where democracy clashes \n        with other significant interests, it is downplayed or even ignored.” \n        (Quoted, Chomsky, Failed States, Hamish Hamilton, 2006, p.149)\n\n    \n\n    Another establishment figure - Robert Pastor, director of Latin American \n      and Caribbean Affairs on the National Security Council through the Carter \n      years - said of the US government:\n\n     \n      “It wanted Nicaraguans to act independently, +except+ when doing \n        so would affect US interests adversely. ” (Chomsky, Deterring Democracy, \n        Hill and Wang, New York, 1992, p.261, original emphasis)\n\n    \n\n    In reality, a limited form of ‘democracy’ at home or abroad \n      is just about acceptable to US elites; as long as it does not lead to a \n      ‘virus’ of independence and self-development that might infect \n      other nations, and thus interfere with US strategic interests and private \n      profit.\n\n    \n\n      Anti-American = Anti-Human\n\n    In light of all that we have discussed in this alert, it is perhaps worth \n      quoting at length from Webb’s emotive conclusion, spoken from the \n      heart of Washington DC:\n\n     \n      “A journey that began in France and took us to Venezuela and Egypt, \n        ends here in a city many Americans refer to without blushing as the ‘capital \n        of the free world’. I’m standing underneath the Washington \n        Monument, the pointy one across from the White House, where huge Stars \n        and Stripes flags [are] blowing in the breeze – you can probably \n        hear them flapping – there are tourists from America, and from around \n        the world, queuing to get to the top and get a bird’s-eye view of \n        the city. \n\n      “Is this the capital of a nation that deserves to be despised? \n        Is this the heart of an evil empire seeking global domination? There are \n        those who’ve told us - eloquently, passionately - that that is precisely \n        what it is.\n\n      “But it seems to me the empire complaint only has real justification \n        if the world is given no say in the project, no choice about whether or \n        not to be on board. Those questions are debatable. And here I am anyway, \n        talking about having a say, proposing the idea of limits on power. Well, \n        where do those ideas come from, if not this place? Even if you don’t \n        buy the argument that modern democracy was really born here, you have \n        to accept that this nation has done more than any other on the face of \n        the Earth to democratise life on this planet; to sell the idea to itself \n        and to foreigners. \n\n      “You can argue, I suppose, as some have done in these programmes, \n        that individual freedom is anyway a mirage; that Americans are actually \n        enslaved by commercial interests or by the media. Well, I live here and \n        I don’t think they are. None of us is truly free, of course. But \n        Americans have real access to information about the world and a real freedom \n        to know and speak their minds – men and women.” \n\n    \n\n    With music from Aaron Copeland’s ‘Fanfare for the Common Man’ \n      beginning to swell in the background, Webb revealed the open mind with which \n      he had approached his task:\n\n     \n      “I’ve always felt that to be truly anti-American, to hate \n        the essence of America, is to be anti-human. America represents the best \n        and the worst of us all. Hating the place doesn’t get us anywhere.” \n      \n\n    \n\n    When challenged about the deep bias in Webb’s series, Helen Boaden, \n      head of BBC news, answered blithely:\n\n    \n      “The purpose of the article and the series is make people consider \n        their own views; Justin is trying to examine anti-Americanism - as opposed \n        to anti-Bushism - and in doing so he doesn't promote his own point of \n        view but looks at all shades of opinion. For example, in Venezuela he \n        talked to Chavez supporters who were anti-American - not in a racist sense \n        but in the sense that they had little respect for the essence of what \n        the US is or purports to be. And he also talked to local anti-Chavez people \n        who made the point that the whole of South America has a history of being \n        badly and cruelly run by South Americans. The series is internally balanced.” \n        (Email from Helen Boaden, Media Lens message board, May 4, 2007)\n\n    \n\n    The idea that the series was “internally balanced” is chucklesome \n      indeed. True, Webb did interview both pro- and anti-Chavez supporters in \n      Venezuela. But this ’balance’ was presented within a framework \n      asserting that the United States “has done more than any other on \n      the face of the Earth to democratise life on this planet”.\n\n    On the basis of the evidence we have presented here, and in numerous other \n      media alerts, we can justifiably conclude that Justin Webb, Helen Boaden \n      and other senior media professionals at the BBC are doctrinal managers whose \n      task - unwittingly or not - is to protect the powerful from scrutiny; and \n      to deflect analysis from the interests and goals of power that therefore \n      remain hidden. \n\n    \n\n      SUGGESTED ACTION\n\n    The goal of Media Lens is to promote rationality, compassion and respect \n      for others. If you decide to write to journalists, we strongly urge you \n      to maintain a polite, non-aggressive and non-abusive tone. \n\n    Write to Justin Webb, senior BBC Washington correspondent\n\n      Email: justin.webb@bbc.co.uk\n\n    Write to Mark Damazer, controller of BBC Radio 4\n\n      Email: mark.damazer@bbc.co.uk\n\n    Write to Helen Boaden, head of BBC news\n\n      Email: helenboaden.complaints@bbc.co.uk\n\n    Please send a copy of your emails to us\n\n      Email: editor@medialens.org\n\n    This is a free service but please consider donating to Media Lens: www.medialens.org/donate\n\n      \n\n      \n    \n\t\n\t \t\n        \n              \n\t\t\t  \n        \tName:\t \n\tEmail:\t \n\tRepeat Email:\t \n\tCountry: \tPlease select\nAfganistan\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAmerican Samoa\nAndorra\nAngola\nAnguila\nAntarctica\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nArmenia\nAruba\nAustralia\nAustria\nAzerjaijan\nBahamas\nBahrain\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelarus\nBelguim\nBelize\nBenin\nBermuda\nBhutan\nBolivia\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBouvet Island\nBrazil\nBritish Indian Ocean territory\nBrunei Darussalam\nBulgaria\nBurkina Faso\nBurundi\nCambodia\nCameroon\nCanada\nCape Verde\nCayman Islands\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nChile\nChina\nChristmas Island\nCocos (Keeling) Islands\nColombia\nComoros\nCongo\nCook Islands\nCosta Rica\nCote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)\nCroatia (Hrvatska)\nCuba\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nDjibouti\nDominica\nDominican Republic\nEast Timor\nEcuador\nEgypt\nEl Salvador\nEquatorial Guinea\nEritrea\nEstonia\nEthiopia\nFalkland Islands\nFaroe Islands\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nFrench Guiana\nFrench Polynesia\nFrench Southern Territories\nGabon\nGambia\nGeorgia\nGermany\nGhana\nGreece\nGreenland\nGrenada\nGuadaloupe\nGuam\nGuatamala\nGuinea-Bissau\nGuinea\nGuyana\nHaiti\nHonduras\nHong Kong\nHungary\nIceland\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\nIraq\nIreland\nIsrael\nItaly\nJamaica\nJapan\nJordan\nKazakhstan\nKenya\nKiribati\nKorea (north)\nKorea (south)\nKuwait\nKyrgyzstan\nLaos\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLesotho\nLiberia\nLiechtenstein\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMacau\nMacedonia\nMadagascar\nMalasia\nMalawi\nMaldives\nMali\nMalta\nMarshal Islands\nMartinique\nMauritania\nMauritius\nMayotte\nMexico\nMicronesia\nMoldova\nMonaco\nMongolia\nMontserrat\nMorocco\nMozambique\nMynamar\nNamibia\nNauru\nNepal\nNetherland Antilles\nNetherlands\nNew Caledonia\nNew Zealand\nNicaragua\nNiger\nNigeria\nNiue\nNorfolk Island\nNorthern Marianas Islands\nNorway\nOman\nPakistan\nPalestine\nPalau\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPitcairn\nPoland\nPortugal\nPuerto Rico\nQatar\nReunion\nRomania\nRussian Federation\nRwanda\nSaint Helena\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon\nSaint Vincent\nSamoa\nSan Marino\nSao Tome and Principe\nSaudi Arabia\nSenegal\nSeychelles\nSierra Leone\nSingapore\nSlovak Republic\nSlovenia\nSolomon Islands\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nSouth Georgia\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSudan\nSuriname\nSwaziland\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nSyria\nTaiwan\nTajikistan\nTanzania\nThailand\nTogo\nTokelau\nTonga\nTrinidad and Tobego\nTunisia\nTurkey\nTurkmenistan\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUkraine\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States of America\nUruguay\nUzbekistan\nVanuatu\nVatican City\nVenezuela\nVietnam\nVirgin Islands (British)\nVirgin Islands (US)\nWallis and Futuna Islands\nWestern Sahara\nYemen\nYugoslavia\nZaire\nZambia\nZimbabwe\n\n \n\t \t \n              Full text\t\twhat's \n              the \n\n              difference?\n\t \t \n              Short version\n\t \t \n              Cogitations\n\t \t  \n              \n              \n\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t  \n\n          \n\t\n         \t\t \t \n    printer friendly | email page to friend \n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n    \n\t© copyright 2005 Media \n      Lens | site built \n      by OmWeb\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n  \n\n",

Although a growing amount of Member State legislation comes from Europe, healthcare as a field remains a matter for domestic law. However, in order to enable the fundamental freedoms that each Member State agrees to on joining the EU, many changes have been made and cross-border agreements over time have been cemented into EU legislation. \n\nDuring the 1970?s and 80?s several agreements were reached across the member states regarding the minimum training requirements of certain groups of healthcare professionals. These agreements became known as sectoral directives and applied to;\n\n\t\nDoctors\n\n\t\nGeneral trained Nurses\n\n\t\nPharmacists\n\n\t\nDentists\n\n\n\nThe remainder of the healthcare professional groups that are regulated in the UK are not regulated in ALL the other EU member states and therefore they entered into agreements as far as they could under general systems directives.\n\nIn October 2007 a completely new system of recognising the professional qualifications of EU citizens will come into place. This is referred to as the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications 2005/36/EC. It can be accessed via the Official Journal of the European Union website and is currently being transposed into member state legislation.\n\nThe other relevant piece of legislation currently passing through the European parliament and commission is the Services in the Internal Market Directive. This specifically excludes ?healthcare and pharmaceutical services provided by regulated health professionals to patients to assess, maintain or restore their state of health ? does not affect public healthcare services or access to public funding for healthcare providers ? does not affect reimbursement of costs of healthcare provided in another member state?. However, for all healthcare professionals that are not regulated in other member states, even if they are here, they will be subject to the requirements of this directive.\n\n \n\n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n              Home \n              Contact Us \n              Links \n              Glossary \n              Terms of use \n              Site Map \n              Accessibility \n               \n              Login \n              \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nCopyright CHRE 2006.

          "Pregnancy and maternity: case decisions\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPregnancy and maternity: case decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case decisions below have been grouped by issue e.g.\ndismissal so that you can find the section that addresses your area\nof interest. These decisions are helpful in informing any\nnegotiations you intend to have with your employer about your\ntreatment, helping you decide whether it is likely to be unlawful\nor not and in preparing your case for tribunal. Where a case is\nrelevant to more than one issue, it has been included under each\nrelevant topic.\n\n \n\nDecisions at Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) and above are\ncase law which tribunals have to follow in deciding a case once\nthey have established the facts.\n\n \n\nSome of the most important cases are decided by the European\nCourt of Justice (ECJ). The courts in each European Community\ncountry can ask the ECJ to decide how European laws like the Equal\nTreatment Directive should be applied.\n\n \n\nWhere the case has been reported in the Industrial Relations\nLaw Reports (IRLR) the reference has been included in the case\ntitle. IRLR is often available from public libraries. The case\ndecisions may also be available online from the British and\nIrish Legal Information website.\n\nCase decisions by issue:\n\n\tBreastfeeding\n\tCompensation\n\tContract workers\n\tDismissal\n\tEmployment-related benefits\n\tHealth and safety\n\tIVF\n\tPregnancy, recruitment and promotion\n\tPregnancy-related sickness\n\tRight to return to work\n\tIssues that apply to all sex discrimination\nclaims\n\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nSquillaci v Atkins (1997 ET)\n\nMrs Squillaci was a\nSenior Architectural Technician. Along with other staff she lost\ncontractual benefits which included flexible working when her local\nauthority contracted her department out to Atkins. She took\nmaternity absence from the company and 2 months before her return\ndate she asked to return part-time so that she could continue\nbreastfeeding her baby. Because there was a family history of\nasthma and the baby had eczema it was preferable for the baby's\nhealth that breastfeeding continue for as long as possible. If she\nhad to return full time the distance she would have had to travel\nto work combined with her hours of work would have meant that she\nwas absent for 11 hours and at this time the baby was waking\nfrequently at night. All Mrs Squillaci's proposals for flexible\nworking were rejected and as she could not return to work full-time\nher contract was terminated.\n\n \n\nMrs Squillaci argued that the full-time work condition was\nindirectly discriminatory and a condition that fewer women than men\ncould comply with as the primary carer of children. The tribunal\nagreed with her and found that her employer had discriminated\nagainst her.\n\n\nWilliams v MOD (2003 EAT)\n\nMrs Williams was a flight-lieutenant in the RAF. She wanted to\nreturn to work after taking maternity leave, but also wanted to\ncontinue to breastfeed her baby. However, MOD policy required that\nany woman returning to work would be expected to be able to fulfil\ntheir full range of duties. The MOD made it clear that this might\nwell mean that a woman would not be able to continue breastfeeding.\nThe only other option offered was for a woman to take unpaid\n\"occupational maternity absence\" until she was in a position to\nreturn to her full duties. Mrs Williams felt she could not return\nto work under those terms and resigned.\n\n \n\nThe tribunal decided that Mrs Williams had been directly\ndiscriminated against on the basis of her sex. Not only this, but\nthey stated that she had been automatically\ndirectly discriminated against and therefore did not have to\ncompare herself with a man in similar circumstances. However, at\nthe EAT, all the parties accepted that \"automatic discrimination\"\ndid not apply beyond the end of maternity leave, so the EAT\noverturned the decision, sending it back to the ET to decide\nwhether Mrs Williams was treated less favourably than a male\ncomparator had (or would have) been or, alternatively, whether she\nhad been indirectly discriminated against.\n\nCompensation\n\nDeane v London Borough of Ealing (1993 IRLR 209); MoD v\nMeredith (1995 IRLR 539)(EAT)\n\nDamages are compensatory not punitive.\n\n\n\nMarshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health\nAuthority (No.2)(1993 IRLR 445)(ECJ)\n\nCompensation should make good in full the loss actually\nsustained.\n\n\nMinistry of Defence v Cannock (1994 IRLR 509) (EAT)\n\nUp to 1990, the armed forces had a policy of dismissing\npregnant servicewomen. In 1991, the MOD conceded that this policy\nwas sexually discriminatory. In this case, the EAT gave guidance on\nhow compensation should be calculated when a woman has been\nunlawfully dismissed due to her pregnancy. The EAT said that in\ndeciding how much compensation should be awarded for future loss of\nearnings, the tribunal has to make an assessment of what would have\nhappened in the future. In particular, the tribunal must assess as\na percentage the chance that a woman would have returned to work\nfollowing maternity leave. For example, if there is a 60% chance\nthat a woman would have returned to work after maternity leave if\nshe had not been dismissed, the compensation to be awarded should\nbe 60% of the earnings she would have received had she\nreturned.\n\n \n\nThe EAT also said that if the woman would have incurred\nchildcare costs if she had returned to work, those costs must be\ndeducted from the earnings she would have received in calculating\ncompensation.\n\nVento v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire (2003 IRLR 102)\n(Court of Appeal)\n\nIn this case (which was not a pregnancy discrimination case)\nthe Court of Appeal set guidelines for tribunals on how to\ncalculate compensation for injury to feelings. According to the\nCourt of Appeal, an award of compensation for injury to feelings\nshould fall within one of three bands: the top band, covering the\nmost serious cases, for example where there has been a lengthy\ncampaign of harassment, should normally be between £15,000 and\n£25,000. Only in the most exceptional case should an award of\ncompensation for injury to feelings exceed £25,000. A middle band\nof between £5,000 and £15,000 should be used for serious cases,\nwhich do not merit an award in the highest band. Awards of between\n£500 and £5,000 are appropriate for less serious cases, such as\nwhere the act of discrimination is an isolated or one off\noccurrence, but awards of less than £500 are to be avoided\naltogether, as they risk being regarded as so low as not to be a\nproper recognition of injury to feelings\n\nContract workers\n\nPatefield v Belfast City Council (2000 IRLR 664) (Northern\nIreland Court of Appeal)\n\nThe Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (SDA) makes\nit unlawful for a company to discriminate against a worker supplied\nby another employer to do work for the company, such as an agency\nworker. In the SDA, the company for which the work is done in such\na situation is known as the \"principal\". In this case, Belfast City\nCouncil unlawfully discriminated against an agency worker by\nrefusing to allow her to return to the post she had been carrying\nout before she went on maternity leave. The Council had instead\ngiven the post to a permanent employee while the agency worker was\non maternity leave. The Court of Appeal decided that the Council's\nactions amounted to automatic sex discrimination because it would\nnot have treated the agency worker the way it had but for her\nabsence on maternity leave.\n\n\nCaruana v Manchester Airport PLC (1996 IRLR 378)(EAT)\n\nMrs Caruana was employed by Manchester Airport as an\nindependent sub-contractor under a series of fixed-term contracts.\nWhen she informed the respondent that she was pregnant, they\ndecided not to renew her contract because she would be unavailable\nfor work at the beginning of the next contract.\n\n \n\nThe EAT ruled that it is automatically sex discrimination to\ndismiss a woman, or to refuse to renew her fixed-term contract as a\nconsequence of her pregnancy, regardless of whether a man would not\nhave his contract renewed due to his unavailability at the\nbeginning of a new contract. \n\n\nBP Chemicals Ltd v (1) Gillick (2) Roevin Management Services\nLtd (1994 IRLR 128)(EAT)\n\nRoevin Management Services, an employment agency, had a\ncontract with BP Chemicals to supply it with workers. Ms Gillick\nwas one of those workers. She worked at BP for several years, but\nwhen she stopped working to have a baby, BP did not allow her to\nreturn to her old job. Ms Gillick claimed that her treatment was an\ninfringement of her rights as an employee under the SDA.\n\n \n\nThe EAT found that there was no contract between BP and Ms\nGillick, so she could not bring a claim under the SDA against BP as\nan employee. However, Ms Gillick's could bring a claim against BP\nfor discriminating against her as a contract worker. Roevin\nsupplied her services to BP under a contract between Roevin and BP.\nThis made BP her \"principal\" and the SDA made it unlawful for them\nto discriminate against her.\n\n\nDismissal\n\nO'Neill v (1) Governors of Thomas More RCVA (2) Bedfordshire CC\n(1996 IRLR 372) (EAT)\n\nMrs O'Neill taught at a Roman Catholic\nvoluntary aided school. She became pregnant, and it became public\nknowledge that the father of the child was a Roman Catholic priest\nwho was known in the locality and at the school. She was not\nallowed to return to her job after giving birth to her daughter and\nclaimed sex discrimination and unfair constructive dismissal. Her\nemployer argued that she was not dismissed because of her\npregnancy, but because of the moral and social implications of her\npregnancy (Mrs O'Neill taught religious education). However, the\nEAT said that what mattered was whether Mrs O'Neill's pregnancy was\nan effective cause of her dismissal. It clearly was, so her\ndismissal was automatically discriminatory.\n\n\nHertz v Aldi Marked (1991 IRLR 31) (ECJ)\n\nMrs Hertz was employed as a part-time cashier and saleswoman.\nShe was mainly on sick leave during her pregnancy. She returned to\nwork after her maternity leave ended and had no health problems for\nthe next 6 months. However, in the following year she had 100 days\nsick leave; her illness was directly connected with her pregnancy.\nMrs Hertz's employer dismissed her for repeated absences due to\nillness. The Danish courts referred the matter to the ECJ, asking\nwhether the Equal Treatment Directive provided protection for women\ndismissed as a consequence of sickness absence which is pregnancy\nand childbirth-related. If it did, the Danish court asked whether\nthere was any limit on the period for which that protection\napplied.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ decided that a woman is protected from dismissal\nbecause of sickness absence during statutory maternity leave but\nonce the leave is over there is no reason to distinguish a\npregnancy-related illness from any other. The dismissal of a woman\nfor sickness during pregnancy or maternity leave will be\nautomatically discriminatory, but her dismissal because of sickness\nafter her return from maternity leave will only be discriminatory\nif it can be shown that a man would have been treated more\nfavourably. \n\n\nWebb v Emo Air Cargo (UK) Ltd (1994 IRLR 482; 1995 IRLR645)\n(ECJ)\n\nMrs Webb was recruited to cover for the maternity leave of\nanother employee, and it was agreed that she would be kept on after\nthat employee's return. She began 6 months' training. About two\nweeks after beginning work, Mrs Webb told her manager that she\nthought that she was pregnant. The employer dismissed her because\nshe would be unable to cover her colleague's maternity absence. In\ntheir defence, they argued that they would have treated a man/\nnon-pregnant woman in the same way; it was not the pregnancy that\nled to the dismissal but the employee's unavailability for\nwork.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ decided that the dismissal of a pregnant woman on\naccount of her pregnancy, or for reasons connected with it, is\nautomatically sex discrimination without the need for a comparison\nwith a man, or a non-pregnant and sick employee. Pregnancy cannot\nbe equated with sickness, or with unavailability for work owing to\nsickness.\n\n \n\nThe judgment was endorsed by the House of Lords, which decided\nthat Marleasing required the wording of the SDA to\nbe interpreted in line with the Equal Treatment Directive.\nPregnancy dismissal is automatically unlawful sex discrimination\nwhere a woman has been recruited on an unlimited contract,\nregardless of whether she has been taken on as a maternity\nreplacement and would be absent for part of the period she was\nrecruited to cover for.\n\nBrown v Rentokil (1998 IRLR 445; 1995 IRLR 21; 1992 302)\n(ECJ)\n\nMrs Brown, who was a service driver, became pregnant and\nshortly afterwards went off sick with pregnancy\ncomplications.\n\n \n\nShe was dismissed in accordance with the employer's sickness\npolicy that allowed no more than 26 weeks' continuous absence. This\npolicy applied regardless of sex. As the law stood at the time of\nher dismissal, Mrs Brown was not protected against dismissal on the\ngrounds of pregnancy. (This was before the ERA was amended to give\nall women protection against pregnancy-related dismissal\nirrespective of length of service.) Mrs Brown argued that her\ntreatment was unlawful under the SDA and/or the ETD, regardless of\nwhether a man would be dismissed for a similar period of sickness\nabsence, because her sickness absence was for pregnancy-related\nreasons. The ECJ upheld Mrs Brown's claim, and ruled that to\ndismiss a woman for pregnancy-related sickness while she is\npregnant is unlawful; the ECJ also said that it would be unlawful\nto take into account time off for pregnancy-related sickness while\npregnant in calculating sickness absence when deciding to dismiss a\nwoman for sickness absence after her return from maternity leave.\n\n\n\nCaledonia Bureau Investment & Property v Caffrey (1998 IRLR\n110) (EAT)\n\nMrs Caffrey was unable to return to work after maternity leave\nbecause she was suffering from post-natal depression. She submitted\nsick certificates covering her absence, but her employer dismissed\nher on the grounds of her absence due to illness. Mrs Caffrey\nargued that she had been unfairly dismissed and had suffered sex\ndiscrimination. The EAT said that since a man could not suffer from\na pregnancy-related illness, to dismiss a woman for a reason\nconnected with such an illness, even after her maternity leave has\nended, is sex discrimination. The dismissal was also an\nautomatically unfair dismissal, because it was a dismissal\nconnected with Mrs Caffrey's pregnancy. [This decision has been\ncriticised because it seems inconsistent with the decision of the\nECJ in the Hertz case.]\n\nRees v Apollo Watch Repairs plc (1996 ICR 466)(EAT)\n\nMrs Rees was a receptionist. She was refused her job back\nafter her maternity leave because the employer preferred the woman\nthey had taken on to cover for her as they found her to be more\nefficient. Mrs Rees argued that her dismissal was a direct\nconsequence of her pregnancy and absence on maternity leave. Had\nshe not been absent her employer would not have found a\nreplacement. The EAT said that dismissing a woman on maternity\nleave because her maternity replacement was found to be more\nefficient was direct sex discrimination following\nWebb, since the underlying cause of dismissal\narose from her absence on maternity leave.\n\n\nBerry v The Potter Group Ltd (1999 ET)\n\nMrs Berry was taken on as a warehouse operative on a temporary\ncontract to cover for a maternity leaver. She accepted an offer of\na part-time permanent job, but this was withdrawn and she was\ndismissed for being absent at the start of the new contract. She\nhad suffered an ectopic pregnancy and would have been on unpaid\nsickness absence for approximately 10 weeks. The tribunal found\nthat Mrs Berry had been dismissed for a reason connected with her\nectopic pregnancy and that this was automatically unfair sex\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nEmployment-related benefits\n\nGUS Home Shopping Ltd v Green and McLaughlin (2001 IRLR 75)\n(EAT)\n\nMrs McLaughlin and Mrs Green were employed\nin the marketing department of GUS, based in Worcester. GUS decided\nto relocate the marketing department to Manchester, making some\nemployees redundant. The company introduced a discretionary loyalty\nbonus to ensure the smooth transfer of the undertaking. Eligibility\nwas based on the employee demonstrating cooperation and goodwill,\nremaining in post to an agreed date, and the orderly and effective\ntransfer of the undertaking in the preceding 6 months. Mrs\nMcLaughlin and Mrs Green did not receive any loyalty payment, the\nformer owing to her absence on maternity leave throughout the\nrelevant period and the latter for her absence for part of the\nrelevant period for a combination of pregnancy-related sickness and\nmaternity leave reasons.\n\n \n\nThe EAT upheld the tribunal's decision that the employer had\ndiscriminated against the two women by disqualifying them from the\nbonus because they were absent from work during the relevant period\nfor pregnancy and maternity-related reasons. The House of Lords in\nWebb (no.2) suggested that the usual rule in\nWebb (discussed under \"Dismissal\" above) would not\napply where a woman would be absent on maternity leave for the\nwhole of the period of the contract for which she was engaged. GUS\nhad argued that the loyalty bonus was a separate contract from the\nmain employment contract, with a definite payment for a definite\npurpose for a definite period. They claimed that because Mrs Green\nand Mrs McLaughlin were absent for the whole of the period of that\n\"separate contract\", the exception to Webb\napplied, and it was not discriminatory to refuse to pay them the\nloyalty bonus. The EAT held that the tribunal had correctly decided\nthat this case did not fall within the exception. The loyalty bonus\nwas part and parcel of Mrs Green and Mrs McLaughlin's employment\ncontracts, not a separate contract. Since they would not be absent\non maternity leave for the whole of the period of their employment\ncontract, it was sex discrimination to refuse to pay them the\nbonus.\n\n\nPedersen v Kvickly Skive (1999 IRLR 55)(ECJ)\n\nMrs Pedersen experienced a difficult pregnancy and was unfit\nfor work due to illness before maternity leave. Under Danish law\nemployees who are absent from work owing to illness are entitled to\nfull pay. However, there are different provisions for pregnant\nworkers. A pregnant employee who is ill is entitled to full pay\nonly if the illness is unconnected with pregnancy. According to\nthese rules Mrs Pedersen was not entitled to full pay, because her\nillness was connected with her pregnancy. In accordance with Danish\nlaw, she was suspended on half pay. The ECJ held that it is\nautomatically sex discrimination to exclude a pregnant woman who\nhas not yet started her maternity leave from a sick pay scheme,\neven if her sickness is pregnancy related. However, it is not\ndiscriminatory to refuse to pay sick pay to a woman who is absent\nfrom work due to \"inconveniences\" (rather than sickness) related to\nher pregnancy. The ECJ also held that where a woman has been\nsuspended from work for health and safety reasons because no\nsuitable work is available for her, it is discriminatory not to pay\nher full pay while suspended.\n\n\nAlabaster v (1) Woolwich PLC (2) Secretary of State for Social\nSecurity (2004 IRLR 486)(ECJ)\n\nMs Alabaster worked as an administrator for the building\nsociety. She took maternity leave in January '96. Her pay rise,\nawarded to her in December, was not included in her maternity pay.\nThis was because it was awarded outside the eight week calculation\nperiod (the reference period) for determining the earnings-related\npart of statutory maternity pay.\n\n \n\nShe argued that this breached the Equal Pay Act 1970 (EqPA)\nand European Law, which has established the principle that a woman\nshould benefit from any pay rise \"which is awarded between the\nbeginning of the period covered by reference pay and the end of\nmaternity leave.\"\n\n \n\nThe Court of Appeal asked the ECJ to decide whether European\nlaw meant that Mrs Alabaster's pay-rise should be taken into\naccount in calculating her maternity pay and, if so, how that\ncalculation should be worked out.\n\n \n\nIn March 2004, the ECJ confirmed that Ms Alabaster's pay rise\nshould have been taken into account in calculating her maternity\npay. However, the ECJ said it was for the UK Government to decide\nhow the law should be changed to implement this. The case will go\nback to the Court of Appeal, which will have to decide whether Ms\nAlabaster's claim to recover the underpayment of maternity pay\nshould have been brought under the EqPA or as a claim for deduction\nof wages under the ERA.\n\n\nHealth and safety\n\nPedersen v Kvickly Skive (1999 IRLR 55)(ECJ)\n\nMrs Pedersen experienced a difficult\npregnancy and was unfit for work due to illness before maternity\nleave. Under Danish law employees who are absent from work owing to\nillness are entitled to full pay. However, there are different\nprovisions for pregnant workers. A pregnant employee who is ill is\nentitled to full pay only if the illness is unconnected with\npregnancy. According to these rules Mrs Pedersen was not entitled\nto full pay, because her illness was connected with her pregnancy.\nIn accordance with Danish law, she was suspended on half pay. The\nECJ held that it is automatically sex discrimination to exclude a\npregnant woman who has not yet started her maternity leave from a\nsick pay scheme, even if her sickness is pregnancy related.\nHowever, it is not discriminatory to refuse to pay sick pay to a\nwoman who is absent from work due to \"inconveniences\" (rather than\nsickness) related to her pregnancy. The ECJ also held that where a\nwoman has been suspended from work for health and safety reasons\nbecause no suitable work is available for her, it is discriminatory\nnot to pay her full pay while suspended.\n\nJohnson v Kauffman (ET 1999)\n\nMrs Johnson, a senior hair stylist, could not stand for long\nperiods because she was pregnant. As a result, she asked not to\nwork the late night opening at the salon. Her employer: tried to\nreduce her pay and days worked; deducted pay for her ante natal\nvisit; insisted on flexible rostering of lunch breaks so she was\ninvariably on lates; gave her insufficient rest breaks; banned\nhusbands from collecting spouses from the staff room, made her\nsweep up outside the shop; issued her with disciplinary warnings.\nMrs Johnson's GP had provided a medical certificate on which she\nwrote that though fit for work, Mrs Johnson should not stand for\nprolonged periods owing to pregnancy. She had to produce an\nadditional medical report when the employer refused the\ncertificate. The tribunal decided that the above were acts of\nunlawful sex discrimination. In addition, they examined the\nrespondent's completed risk assessment form and found that it made\nno reference to women of childbearing age, that it was dated two\nmonths after Mrs Johnson's pregnancy was known about and that it\npaid retrospective lip service to health and safety regulations.\nThe regulations had been breached in the failure to: carry out a\nrisk assessment of women in child bearing age; conduct a risk\nassessment on Mrs Johnson, which was not dependent on written\nnotice of pregnancy, and the failure to act on the risk assessment\non receipt of the written notice of the pregnancy.\n\n\nHickey v Lucas Service UK Limited (ET 1997)\n\nMrs Hickey, a delivery driver, was disciplined for poor work\nperformance and moved to warehouse stores assistant duties, a job\nof equivalent pay and status as a driver, but which involved heavy\nlifting. The tribunal said, \"The employer clearly has a duty to\ninform itself of the risks to workers generally and to pregnant\nworkers in particular and to take appropriate action.\" Mrs Hickey's\nconcerns about risks to her pregnancy had not been expressed very\nclearly initially, but they were genuine and the Regional Managers\nresponse that she \"exercise common sense\" and be responsible for\nnot taking on inappropriate tasks, breached health and safety\nrequirements. These requirements were to conduct general risk\nassessments on the driver and stores assistant posts as well as\nassessments specific to Mrs Hickey and her pregnancy.\n\n \n\nMrs Hickey had absented herself from work because of her\nconcerns and had received statutory sick pay prior to returning to\nthe more suitable post given to her by her employer in response to\nher health and safety concerns. The tribunal found that the period\nin question amounted to a suspension on health and safety grounds\nand the failure to pay her full pay also breached health and safety\nregulations.\n\n\nMahlburg v Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (2000 IRLR 276)\n(ECJ)\n\nMs Mahlburg was a nurse working on a year's fixed-term\ncontract in a heart surgery clinic. She became pregnant. She\napplied for permanent employment as a theatre nurse, which would\nhave involved her in preparing and handling instruments during\noperations. She was rejected on the grounds of her pregnancy\nbecause German health and safety law prohibits the employment of\npregnant women in circumstances that would be hazardous. Ms\nMahlburg claimed that this was sex discrimination contrary to\nEuropean law.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ held that refusing to appoint a pregnant woman to a\npermanent contract because of a statutory requirement prohibiting\nemployment for health and safety reasons for the duration of a\npregnancy, is in breach of the Equal Treatment Directive. This is\nnotwithstanding the clause in the Directive enabling protective\nmeasures for pregnancy and maternity reasons. The ECJ held that\nhealth and safety measures must not give rise to less favourable\ntreatment of pregnant women in access to jobs as this would\nrepresent a fundamental breach of the principle of equality in the\nDirective.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ also ruled that an employer couldn't justify pregnancy\ndiscrimination in recruitment on the ground of financial loss\narising from the inability to employ a woman in a particular post\nfor the duration of her pregnancy.\n\n\nDay v T Pickles Farms Ltd (1999 IRLR 217) (EAT)\n\nMrs Day was a counter assistant at a sandwich shop where\nchickens were roasted on the premises twice daily. Mrs Day had\nsevere morning sickness. She told her employer about her pregnancy\nand that the smell of food made her feel sick while at work. She\nwent on prolonged certificated sick leave during which time she\nkept in telephone contact with the employer. Mrs Day's employer\npaid her statutory sick pay until her entitlement was exhausted.\nMrs Day then resigned and claimed constructive dismissal, the\nfailure to pay her statutory sick pay being the last straw. The\nemployer's failure to carry out a risk assessment was also a chief\nfeature in her constructive dismissal claim, as was the refusal to\nallow her paid time off for antenatal care.\n\n \n\nMrs Day's claim of constructive dismissal failed, as she had\nnot made it plain to her employer that she considered herself to\nhave been constructively dismissed by his actions. However, the EAT\nfound that failure to carry out a risk assessment in relation to\nwomen of childbearing age (as the health and safety regulations\nrequire) could constitute sex discrimination, if it results in a\ndetriment to the employee.\n\n\nHardman v Mallon (trading as Orchard Lodge Nursing Home) (2002\nIRLR 516) (EAT)\n\nMs Hardman worked as a care assistant at the Orchard lodge\nNursing Home. Her job involved some lifting of residents and when\nshe found out she was pregnant, she was concerned that the lifting\ncould pose a risk to her and her unborn child. She raised her\nconcerns with her employer, but her employer failed to carry out an\nassessment of the risks posed to her and her baby by her working\nconditions. At the tribunal, her employer argued that the failure\nto carry out a risk assessment could not be sex discrimination\nbecause the employer had not carried out an assessment of the risks\nposed to male workers by their working conditions. She argued that\nthis meant that Ms Hardman had not been treated less favourably\nthan her male colleagues.\n\n \n\nThe EAT noted that the Management of Health and Safety at Work\nRegulations require a specific assessment of the risks posed to new\nand expectant mothers by their working conditions. It said that a\nfailure to carry out such a risk assessment was automatically sex\ndiscrimination, regardless of whether a risk assessment had been\ncarried out in relation to male employees.\n\nIske v P & O Ferries (1997 IRLR 401)(EAT)\n\nMrs Iske was a seagoing stewardess working in the perfume shop\non board of the Pride of Bruges ferry, on the Dover to Calais\nroute. Her employment was subject to merchant shipping regulations,\nwhich prohibit pregnant women from working at sea after 28 weeks of\npregnancy until at least 6 weeks after delivery. Mrs Iske became\npregnant and hoped that she would be able to work up to 2 weeks\nbefore the birth and that she would be found work on shore.\nHowever, no steps were taken to find her alternative employment,\nalthough alternative work on shore had been found for a man and for\na woman under 28 weeks pregnant, who were temporarily unfit for sea\nduties. Mrs Iske was compelled to take maternity leave with\nstatutory maternity pay straight away, because of the\nregulations.\n\n \n\nMrs Iske claimed that the company's failure to find her\nalternative work, to suspend her on full pay (as required by health\nand safety regulations) or to pay her full sick pay was direct sex\ndiscrimination in breach of the SDA and European law. The employer\nargued that because pregnancy was a unique condition without\ncomparison, Mrs Iske could not use a man as her chosen comparator.\nIt also argued that she had no contractual right to work on shore\nnor any statutory rights as merchant shipping was excluded from\nhealth and safety regulations.\n\n \n\nThe EAT upheld her appeal. It decided that the tribunal had\nbeen wrong in finding that her male comparator, a sick man, was an\nirrelevant comparison for a pregnant woman. Although the situation\nof a pregnant woman cannot be compared with that of a sick man in\ndeciding whether there is less favourable treatment, comparison of\nthe way Mrs Iske was treated with the way a man was treated was\nrelevant evidence in deciding whether the reason\nMrs Iske was treated less favourably was her pregnancy. Mrs Iske\nhad not been offered a transfer, while other non-pregnant employees\n(including men) had been transferred. The EAT accepted that this\nwas evidence from which they could infer that the reason Mrs Iske\nwas not transferred was because she was over 28 weeks\npregnant.\n\n \n\nThe EAT also said that failure to bring merchant shipping\nregulations within the scope of health and safety regulations was a\nbreach by the UK Government of the Pregnant Workers' Directive. The\nlaw has subsequently been amended to bring this work in scope to\nthe relevant health and safety regulations.\n\n\nTapp v The Chief Constable of Suffolk (1998 ET)\n\nMiss Tapp was a probationer police constable. She did not know\nit, but she was pregnant at the time of her appointment. Recruits\nhad to follow a two-year prescribed structured training programme\nduring which time the group stayed together at local and district\ntraining schools. Five weeks into her training Miss Tapp found out\nthat she was pregnant and obtained her GP's view that she could\ncontinue with the physical aspects of her training. However, her\nemployer removed her from training and assigned her to\nadministrative duties where the quality of the work was less\nsatisfying, and on her return from maternity leave she would have\nto start her training all over again. The tribunal held that there\nhad been a breach of the SDA in removing Miss Tapp from an\nimportant training course because of pregnancy, which effectively\nbrought her career to a halt, when a risk assessment would have\nshown that this was not necessary.\n\n\nIVF\n\nLondon Borough of Greenwich v Robinson (1995 EAT)\n\nMs Robinson was a highly qualified and\nexperienced psychiatric social worker within the Child Guidance\nUnit of the Borough.\n\nDuring her employment she underwent 2 unsuccessful courses of\nIVF treatment, which were classed as sickness absence. The council\nsought to reduce its workforce with a redundancy programme. Ms\nRobinson took voluntary redundancy under duress because her manager\nhad decided to base the selection decision on sickness absence\nonly, excluding other criteria, which would have made her\nvulnerable to compulsory redundancy on less favourable terms.\n\n \n\nMs Robinson argued unfair selection for redundancy and direct\nand/or indirect sex discrimination. The tribunal decided that Ms\nRobinson had been unfairly selected for redundancy because her\nemployer had disregarded other criteria. However, the sex\ndiscrimination claims failed on the grounds that men could undergo\nfertility treatment and would be treated in the same way as regards\ncalculating sickness absence for redundancy purposes. The absences\nwere for medical treatment and could not in this case be deemed to\nbe pregnancy-related (see Webb which is discussed\nabove under \"Dismissal\") nor was it appropriate to single out\nparticular types of sickness from the sickness record criterion for\nthe detrimental impact they might have on one sex compared with the\nother in the redundancy stakes.\n\n\nPregnancy,\nrecruitment and promotion\n\nDekker v VJV-Centrum (1991 IRLR 27) (ECJ)\n\nMrs Dekker applied for a post as a training\ninstructor in a youth centre. She informed the selection committee\nthat she was pregnant. The committee recommended her as the most\nsuitable candidate for appointment, but the employer decided not to\nrecruit her because they would not have been reimbursed for\nbenefits paid to her during maternity leave under the Dutch\nsystem.\n\n \n\nThe case was referred to the ECJ by the Dutch courts. Two of\nthe issues they were asked to address were: whether an employer is\nin breach of the Equal Treatment Directive (ETD) where he refuses\nemployment to a pregnant woman because of the possible adverse\nconsequences to him arising from the fact that she is pregnant;\nwhether, despite having violated the ETD, the employer can then\nrely on the defence of legal justification under national\nlaw.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ's decision was that the ETD gives automatic protection\nto a pregnant woman who is refused a job because of financial\nconsequences of her maternity absence (in this case, the\nadministration of maternity benefits). Since pregnancy is unique to\nwomen, refusal of employment connected with pregnancy is\nautomatically sex discrimination, regardless of how a man would\nhave been treated in the same circumstances. The ECJ also decided\nthat the law did not allow the employer to justify such direct\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nMahlburg v Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (2000 IRLR 276)\n(ECJ)\n\nMs Mahlburg was a nurse working on a year's fixed-term\ncontract in a heart surgery clinic. She became pregnant. She\napplied for permanent employment as a theatre nurse, which would\nhave involved her in preparing and handling instruments during\noperations. She was rejected on the grounds of her pregnancy\nbecause German health and safety law prohibits the employment of\npregnant women in circumstances that would be hazardous. Ms\nMahlburg claimed that this was sex discrimination contrary to\nEuropean law.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ held that refusing to appoint a pregnant woman to a\npermanent contract because of a statutory requirement prohibiting\nemployment for health and safety reasons for the duration of a\npregnancy, is in breach of the Equal Treatment Directive. This is\nnotwithstanding the clause in the Directive enabling protective\nmeasures for pregnancy and maternity reasons. The ECJ held that\nhealth and safety measures must not give rise to less favourable\ntreatment of pregnant women in access to jobs as this would\nrepresent a fundamental breach of the principle of equality in the\nDirective.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ also ruled that an employer couldn't justify pregnancy\ndiscrimination in recruitment on the ground of financial loss\narising from the inability to employ a woman in a particular post\nfor the duration of her pregnancy.\n\nCNAVTS v Thibault (1998 IRLR 399) (ECJ)\n\nMs Thibault was employed as a legal drafter by the French\ncivil service. Promotion rules were determined by a national\ncollective agreement which provided that an employee who had been\npresent at work for at least 6 months must be assessed on their\nwork and conduct; qualifying for promotion was subject to such an\nassessment. Ms Thibault could not meet the '6 month rule' due to a\ncombination of sick leave and several months' maternity leave. Her\nemployer did not assess her performance and she complained of sex\ndiscrimination.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ ruled that the right to an annual performance\nassessment, which might lead to a promotion, was an integral part\nof working conditions, which the Equal Treatment Directive requires\nbe provided on an equal basis to men and women. To deny a woman\nemployee the right to have her performance assessed annually would\ndiscriminate against her in her capacity as a worker because, if\nshe had not been pregnant and had not taken maternity leave to\nwhich she was entitled, she would have been assessed for the year\nin question and could have qualified for promotion.\n\nGreenfield v (1) Ian MacAuley (2) Westward Babywear Ltd (2000\nET)\n\nMs Greenfield was the company's Financial Accountant,\nreporting to the Financial Director. She went on maternity leave in\nSeptember '98. Mr Strachan, a qualified Chartered Accountant, was\nappointed to cover her maternity leave. He was then promoted to a\nnewly created more senior post above Ms Greenfield. Ms Greenfield\nwas informed of the changes made in her absence on the day she\nreturned from her maternity leave. She resigned because of her\ntreatment and claimed sex discrimination.\n\n \n\nThe tribunal found that Ms Greenfield had been unfairly\ndismissed and suffered unlawful sex discrimination: Ms Greenfield's\naccess to promotion had been hindered by the fact that she had not\nbeen considered because she was on maternity leave at the time that\nconsideration was given to the creation of a new post. The tribunal\nalso found that the appointment of Mr Strachan above her and\nbetween her and the Finance Director also hindered her prospects of\npromotion. The tribunal concluded that Ms Greenfield's loss of\nstatus and changes imposed on her without any consultation upon her\nreturn from maternity leave, amounted to subjecting her to a\ndetriment.\n\n\nVisa International Service Association v Paul (2004 IRLR\n42)(EAT)\n\nMrs Paul worked in the card design section of Visa's operating\nregulations services department. She took maternity leave in July\n2000. Before doing so, she had expressed an interest in moving to\nthe dispute resolution section within the same department. While\nMrs Paul was on maternity leave, Visa re-organised the department,\ncreating two new posts. The tribunal found that Mrs Paul was not\ntold about the vacancies because she was on maternity leave.\n\n \n\nMrs Paul claimed that the failure to keep her informed about\ndevelopments in her department while she was on maternity leave was\nsex discrimination and a breach of the implied term of good faith\nin her employment contract. She claimed that the breach was serious\nenough to justify her resigning and claiming constructive\ndismissal, and that that dismissal was automatically unfair under\ns.99 of ERA because it was related to her maternity leave.\n\n \n\nThe ET agreed with Mrs Paul and found that Visa's failure to\nkeep her informed of developments during her maternity leave was\nunlawful sex discrimination and also breached her contract of\nemployment to such an extent that she could claim constructive\ndismissal. Because that dismissal was related to her maternity\nleave, it was automatically unfair. The EAT upheld the ET's\ndecision.\n\nPregnancy-related sickness\n\nHertz v Aldi Marked (1991 IRLR 31) (ECJ)\n\nMrs Hertz was employed as a part-time\ncashier and saleswoman. She was mainly on sick leave during her\npregnancy. She returned to work after her maternity leave ended and\nhad no health problems for the next 6 months. However, in the\nfollowing year she had 100 days sick leave; her illness was\ndirectly connected with her pregnancy. Mrs Hertz's employer\ndismissed her for repeated absences due to illness. The Danish\ncourts referred the matter to the ECJ, asking whether the Equal\nTreatment Directive provided protection for women dismissed as a\nconsequence of sickness absence which is pregnancy and\nchildbirth-related. If it did, the Danish court asked whether there\nwas any limit on the period for which that protection\napplied.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ decided that a woman is protected from dismissal\nbecause of sickness absence during statutory maternity leave but\nonce the leave is over there is no reason to distinguish a\npregnancy-related illness from any other. The dismissal of a woman\nfor sickness during pregnancy or maternity leave will be\nautomatically discriminatory, but her dismissal because of sickness\nafter her return from maternity leave will only be discriminatory\nif it can be shown that a man would have been treated more\nfavourably.\n\n\nPedersen v Kvickly Skive (1999 IRLR 55)(ECJ)\n\nMrs Pedersen experienced a difficult pregnancy and was unfit\nfor work due to illness before maternity leave. Under Danish law\nemployees who are absent from work owing to illness are entitled to\nfull pay. However, there are different provisions for pregnant\nworkers. A pregnant employee who is ill is entitled to full pay\nonly if the illness is unconnected with pregnancy. According to\nthese rules Mrs Pedersen was not entitled to full pay, because her\nillness was connected with her pregnancy. In accordance with Danish\nlaw, she was suspended on half pay. The ECJ held that it is\nautomatically sex discrimination to exclude a pregnant woman who\nhas not yet started her maternity leave from a sick pay scheme,\neven if her sickness is pregnancy related. However, it is not\ndiscriminatory to refuse to pay sick pay to a woman who is absent\nfrom work due to \"inconveniences\" (rather than sickness) related to\nher pregnancy. The ECJ also held that where a woman has been\nsuspended from work for health and safety reasons because no\nsuitable work is available for her, it is discriminatory not to pay\nher full pay while suspended.\n\n\nCaledonia Bureau Investment & Property v Caffrey (1998 IRLR\n110) (EAT)\n\nMrs Caffrey was unable to return to work after maternity leave\nbecause she was suffering from post-natal depression. She submitted\nsick certificates covering her absence, but her employer dismissed\nher on the grounds of her absence due to illness. Mrs Caffrey\nargued that she had been unfairly dismissed and had suffered sex\ndiscrimination. The EAT said that since a man could not suffer from\na pregnancy-related illness, to dismiss a woman for a reason\nconnected with such an illness, even after her maternity leave has\nended, is sex discrimination. The dismissal was also an\nautomatically unfair dismissal, because it was a dismissal\nconnected with Mrs Caffrey's pregnancy. [This decision has been\ncriticised because it seems inconsistent with the decision of the\nECJ in the Hertz case.]\n\nBrown v Rentokil (1998 IRLR 445; 1995 IRLR 21; 1992 302)\n(ECJ)\n\nMrs Brown, who was a service driver, became pregnant and\nshortly afterwards went off sick with pregnancy\ncomplications.\n\n \n\nShe was dismissed in accordance with the employer's sickness\npolicy that allowed no more than 26 weeks' continuous absence. This\npolicy applied regardless of sex. As the law stood at the time of\nher dismissal, Mrs Brown was not protected against dismissal on the\ngrounds of pregnancy. (This was before the ERA was amended to give\nall women protection against pregnancy-related dismissal\nirrespective of length of service.) Mrs Brown argued that her\ntreatment was unlawful under the SDA and/or the ETD, regardless of\nwhether a man would be dismissed for a similar period of sickness\nabsence, because her sickness absence was for pregnancy-related\nreasons. The ECJ upheld Mrs Brown's claim, and ruled that to\ndismiss a woman for pregnancy-related sickness while she is\npregnant is unlawful; the ECJ also said that it would be unlawful\nto take into account time off for pregnancy-related sickness while\npregnant in calculating sickness absence when deciding to dismiss a\nwoman for sickness absence after her return from maternity leave.\n\n\n\nRight to return to\nwork\n\nGreenfield v (1) Ian MacAuley (2) Westward Babywear Ltd (2000\nET)\n\nMs Greenfield was the company's Financial\nAccountant, reporting to the Financial Director. She went on\nmaternity leave in September '98. Mr Strachan, a qualified\nChartered Accountant, was appointed to cover her maternity leave.\nHe was then promoted to a newly created more senior post above Ms\nGreenfield. Ms Greenfield was informed of the changes made in her\nabsence on the day she returned from her maternity leave. She\nresigned because of her treatment and claimed sex\ndiscrimination.\n\n \n\nThe tribunal found that Ms Greenfield had been unfairly\ndismissed and suffered unlawful sex discrimination: Ms Greenfield's\naccess to promotion had been hindered by the fact that she had not\nbeen considered because she was on maternity leave at the time that\nconsideration was given to the creation of a new post. The tribunal\nalso found that the appointment of Mr Strachan above her and\nbetween her and the Finance Director also hindered her prospects of\npromotion. The tribunal concluded that Ms Greenfield's loss of\nstatus and changes imposed on her without any consultation upon her\nreturn from maternity leave, amounted to subjecting her to a\ndetriment.\n\n\nSquillaci v Atkins (1997 ET)\n\nMrs Squillaci was a Senior Architectural Technician. Along\nwith other staff she lost contractual benefits which included\nflexible working when her local authority contracted her department\nout to Atkins. She took maternity absence from the company and 2\nmonths before her return date she asked to return part-time so that\nshe could continue breastfeeding her baby. Because there was a\nfamily history of asthma and the baby had eczema it was preferable\nfor the baby's health that breastfeeding continue for as long as\npossible. If she had to return full time the distance she would\nhave had to travel to work combined with her hours of work would\nhave meant that she was absent for 11 hours and at this time the\nbaby was waking frequently at night. All Mrs Squillaci's proposals\nfor flexible working were rejected and as she could not return to\nwork full-time her contract was terminated.\n\n \n\nMrs Squillaci argued that the full-time work condition was\nindirectly discriminatory and a condition that fewer women than men\ncould comply with as the primary carer of children. The tribunal\nagreed with her and found that her employer had discriminated\nagainst her.\n\nWilliams v MOD\n\nMrs Williams was a flight-lieutenant in the RAF. She wanted to\nreturn to work after taking maternity leave, but also wanted to\ncontinue to breastfeed her baby. However, MOD policy required that\nany woman returning to work would be expected to be able to fulfil\ntheir full range of duties. The MOD made it clear that this might\nwell mean that a woman would not be able to continue breastfeeding.\nThe only other option offered was for a woman to take unpaid\n\"occupational maternity absence\" until she was in a position to\nreturn to her full duties. Mrs Williams felt she could not return\nto work under those terms and resigned.\n\n \n\nThe tribunal decided that Mrs Williams had been directly\ndiscriminated against on the basis of her sex. Not only this, but\nthey stated that she had been automatically\ndirectly discriminated against and therefore did not have to\ncompare herself with a man in similar circumstances. However, at\nthe EAT, all the parties accepted that \"automatic discrimination\"\ndid not apply beyond the end of maternity leave, so the EAT\noverturned the decision, sending it back to the ET to decide\nwhether Mrs Williams was treated less favourably than a male\ncomparator had (or would have) been or, alternatively, whether she\nhad been indirectly discriminated against.\n\nRees v Apollo Watch Repairs plc (1996 ICR 466)(EAT)\n\nMrs Rees was a receptionist. She was refused her job back\nafter her maternity leave because the employer preferred the woman\nthey had taken on to cover for her as they found her to be more\nefficient. Mrs Rees argued that her dismissal was a direct\nconsequence of her pregnancy and absence on maternity leave. Had\nshe not been absent her employer would not have found a\nreplacement. The EAT held that dismissing a woman on maternity\nleave because her maternity replacement was found to be more\nefficient was direct sex discrimination following\nWebb, since the underlying cause of dismissal\narose from her absence on maternity leave.\n\n\nIssues that apply to\nall sex discrimination claims\n\nKing v Great Britain-China Centre (1991 IRLR 513)(Court of\nAppeal)\n\nThe claimant must make out a case on the\nbalance of probabilities. It is then for the employer to provide a\nsatisfactory explanation, in the absence of which it is reasonable\nto infer discrimination. There is unlikely to be direct evidence of\ndiscrimination. The outcome of a case will depend on inferences\ndrawn from the primary facts, including an inference of\ndiscrimination from a failure to reply to a questionnaire, or an\nevasive or equivocal reply. This approach is now reflected in the\nSDA as a result of the Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination\nand Burden of Proof) Regulations 2001.\n\nBarton v Investec Henderson Crosthwaite Securities (2003 IRLR\n332) (EAT)\n\nIn this case the EAT gave guidelines to tribunals on how to\napply the Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination and Burden of\nProof) Regulations 2001. If the tribunal find facts from which they\ncould infer that the reason for the less favourable treatment of a\nwoman could have been sex discrimination, the tribunal is obliged\nto find in favour of the woman unless the employer can put satisfy\nthem that there is another non-discriminatory explanation for the\nless favourable treatment.\n\n\nJames v Eastleigh Borough Council (1990 IRLR 288)(House of\nLords)\n\nIntention and motive are irrelevant when deciding whether\ndiscrimination has taken place. The objective test for determining\nthis is, whether \"but for\" your sex, would you have received the\nsame treatment.\n\n\nMarleasing SA v LA Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA\n(1990 1ECR 435; 1992 1 CMLR 305) (ECJ)\n\nWhere possible, UK courts and tribunals must interpret\ndomestic legislation in a way that complies with European Community\nlaw. This means that the SDA must be read in such a way that it is\nconsistent with the principles and intentions of the Equal\nTreatment Directive (ETD). Because the ETD is broader in scope than\nthe SDA, this means that bringing a claim under the ETD as well as\nthe SDA can sometimes improve its prospects of\nsuccess.\n\n\nWebb v Emo Air Cargo (UK) Ltd (1994 IRLR 482; 1995 IRLR645)\n(ECJ)\n\nMrs Webb was recruited to cover for the maternity leave of\nanother employee, and it was agreed that she would be kept on after\nthat employee's return. She began 6 months' training. About two\nweeks after beginning work, Mrs Webb told her manager that she\nthought that she was pregnant. The employer dismissed her because\nshe would be unable to cover her colleague's maternity absence. In\ntheir defence, they argued that they would have treated a man/\nnon-pregnant woman in the same way; it was not the pregnancy that\nled to the dismissal but the employee's unavailability for\nwork.\n\n \n\nThe ECJ decided that the dismissal of a pregnant woman on\naccount of her pregnancy, or for reasons connected with it, is\nautomatically sex discrimination without the need for a comparison\nwith a man, or a non-pregnant and sick employee. Pregnancy cannot\nbe equated with sickness, or with unavailability for work owing to\nsickness.\n\n \n\nThe judgment was endorsed by the House of Lords , which\ndecided that Marleasing required the wording of\nthe SDA to be interpreted in line with the Equal Treatment\nDirective. Pregnancy dismissal is automatically unlawful sex\ndiscrimination where a woman has been recruited on an unlimited\ncontract, regardless of whether she has been taken on as a\nmaternity replacement and would be absent for part of the period\nshe was recruited to cover for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHow to contact the Helpline\n\nBy phone\n\nYou can phone the Helpline Monday to Friday from 9.00am to 5.00pm on 0845 601 5901\nCalls from BT landlines are charged at local rates\n\nCalls may be monitored for training purposes\n\nIf you need advice in a language other than English we can talk to you through an interpreter from Language Line.

I spent Monday with you this week, Tuesday with you this week and now Thursday morning. Yesterday was a little sad from my point of view, but I am delighted to be here with you.\n\tThis is a very, very significant conference and I have been asked today to talk about specifically the Third sector, in the context of what we are trying to do at DH and in the context of the kind of society this government is seeking to create. A society which is strengthened on the dual, and inextricably linked, foundations of both social justice and of economic success, and there is a recognition in that context that we can only build such a society if we have all the contributors to that society playing their equal part and fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\tI myself, before I came into politics, spent my entire working life in the voluntary sector. I was recently introduced at a conference as having been elected to parliament in 1977, which would have made me 10. I was actually elected to parliament in 1997 and before that I had spent my entire working life in the Third Sector. I think this is an important point to make at a conference like this where politicians arrive in a suit, make their pre-prepared speech, leave again and people somehow feel there is a disconnect between politics and the issues we are here to talk about. Well most politicians actually have a significant hinterland before they entered the formal world of politics.\n\tI began my role at the age of 14; I was at a secondary school, expected to do traditional GCSEs or perhaps O Levels as they were in those days, go and do some A-Levels, go to University and get a proper job. My parents are still waiting, I think, for that to happen.\n\tBut I got involved in voluntary work at the age of 14 through school, with people with Learning Disabilities. That very much started to shape the type of career I wanted to have, at the age of 16 or 17. I didn't say this when I was an Education Minister -? I lost interest in formal education and decided that really I wanted to work in the voluntary sector. So I went briefly to work for the organisation I did voluntary work with. At the age of 18 I joined with some colleagues and developed a small voluntary organisation literally from scratch. Initially all the people involved were doing it all on a voluntary basis - again working with people with Learning Disabilities and people with mental health problems.\n\tWe were then fortunate enough to get a small amount of Government funding (I find this quite ironic because it was through Opportunities for Volunteering funding, which I now make decisions about),? and we had enough money to employ one paid worker. I was very fortunate at the age of 18 or 19 to secure that job, and it was my responsibility to develop that organisation from day one, from scratch.\n\tDoing the administration, the fundraising, working directly with users and carers, organising the activities, meeting with other professionals, begging statutory organisations to take us seriously and give us a little bit of funding - all of that range of responsibilities and experiences was extremely exciting at the age of 19. A lot of young people became involved in that organisation - some people having finished their university degrees, not sure what to do with their lives, some people taking a gap-year - and many of these people, who are no longer that young, are now involved in care services of one kind or an other.\n\tI then went to work at a much larger charitable organisation in Manchester providing a culturally sensitive service specifically to the Jewish community; then I became CE of that organisation after about 18 months.? It was an organisation very different to the one I had created and set up with other people. It was 125 years old, it had lost its way a little bit, needed pretty radical reform, thought it was doing a wonderful job, but its only problem was its users and community didn't think it was doing a particularly responsive job, and we had to develop and transform that organisation.\n\tDuring this same period I spent 4 years as chair of my Local Authority's social services committee, having been elected to the Local Authority.\n\tSo my experiences in the Third Sector have been very transformational, in terms of the choices I have made and the experiences I have had in my life; and there is absolutely no question that, when I reflect on those organisations and what the key was, it was not the activities and the provisions, but it was the values that underpinned the work of those organisations which motivated the volunteers and the professional staff who want to make an exceptional contribution. I think this question of values is incredibly important. I also believe, however, not all but in many of the services we were offering to people, they were cutting edge, innovative and responsive in a way that statutory services simply couldn't be, and I think that is very very important. I also believe that the Third Sector shouldn't give the impression that a strong motivation in terms of values is only found in the Third Sector. I think that is extremely insulting to people who work everyday in public services in one kind or the other in the statutory sector, many of whom are equally passionate about the values which drive those services.\n\tSo for me this topic and this new opportunity to be Minister for Care Services, my third job in Government, bring together some of the things that have been most formative in terms of my political beliefs and in terms of the opportunities that I have had.\n\tThe last job I had was at the Treasury as Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and I was able in that role to lay the foundations of the review that is under way, in terms of looking at the relationship between Government and the state and the Third Sector in the context of the next CSR. The chancellor has made it very clear is very clear he wants to see a root and branch review of that relationship and we are currently conducting the largest consultation that has ever taken place in this area.\n\tJust this Monday I was in Cambridge speaking to- and, more importantly, listening to -? representatives of the Third Sector in the East of England. I can tell you, from having been in the Treasury for a year,? the Chancellor almost on a weekly basis was engaging me in a conversation on the Third Sector and the challenges and issues that were facing the Third Sector; and I think that is a very important statement to make in terms of the people at the top of the Party and the Government and their genuine commitment to this sector and its crucial role in the development of the kind of society this Government wants to create.\n\tIn terms of my role in DH, we spend billions of pounds a year and I believe could make far better use than hitherto of the Third Sector in terms of the delivery of services. I am determined to make this happen, to move from rhetoric to reality; and we are going to deliver demonstrable, tangible examples of how things are going to change. I personally have taken over the chairmanship of the Third Sector Commissioning taskforce. In the past, in my view, the way the Third Sector has been involved has often been gimmicky initiatives involving small amounts of money, which frequently do not get to the heart of the problem.\n\tThis taskforce however has been attempting to deal with some of the fundamental issues that face the Third Sector in our society, prior to today: commissioning, procurement, regulation and accreditation.\n\tThere has been constructive discussion, particularly on the issue of commissioning, which everybody here will understand is vital to the improvement of the quality of services. Good commissioning - hearing the views of people, involving partners and focussed on outcomes - is essential to our reforms of health and social care. And good commissioning will also acknowledge what the Third Sector has to offer.\n\tOf course it is also essential that in every community and every part of the country the Third Sector engages with commissioners to make them fully aware of what they have to offer.\n\tA major success so far has been ensuring that the Third Sector is considered in all the reforms we are making to the social care and health system.\n\tIt is absolutely essential in my view that we move the Third Sector from the margins of policy to the mainstreams of policy.\n\tWe intend to publish the Taskforce report shortly. Actual publication won't see the end of the taskforce's work, but really the beginning of the most exciting phase, as we seek to ensure implementation.\n\tThis issue of commissioning is very, very important, in my view: up and down the country there are people fulfilling commissioning responsibilities, who, frankly, do not have the skill set to commission services we want at the start of the 21st century and still have a mindset of commissioning services that were appropriate 20 or 30 years ago.\n\tWe still have a mindset where commissioners look to the safe familiar tools rather than reaching out to innovative and imaginative solutions from any sector in terms of achieving outcomes for users and carers that we seek.\n\tThis question of influencing commissioners and commissioning is absolutely at the heart of the whether we are able to remould our public services. Sometimes we talk about people with those kinds of roles within our public services: we think of highly paid, highly skilled individuals. Actually that is not always the case: sometimes people end up in commissioning roles without any experience, without any skills, without actually engaging in a debate about how their role is at the heart of changing the culture of configuration of services in any locality, so this question is very very important.\n\tWe've also established a Social Enterprise Unit in the Department.\n\tIt will be a hub of ideas, energy and support for social enterprises.? It will link to the ten new Strategic Health Authorities who will provide more localised support to social enterprises. This will be as part of their role in reforming the way services are provided in the community.?\n\tAnd of course it will also link to the overarching social enterprise team in the Office of the Third Sector, under Ed Miliband.? Having a dedicated unit in the Department of Health, in my view, will allow us to focus on helping social enterprise organisations to grow and flourish in the specialised environment of health and social care.\n\tThe Unit will also establish the social enterprise fund promised by the White Paper, a fund to help new and growing social enterprises.? And it will be there to highlight and share best practice.\n\tOne such example of that is an organisation called Local Care Direct, one of the largest providers of urgent healthcare services in the country.? Covering two million people in West Yorkshire, Local Care Direct is a not for profit social enterprise which is very much an integral part of the NHS family.\n\tA workforce of local GPs, specially trained nurses and even dental practitioners providing wide range of innovative services, going far beyond traditional out of hours cover.? For example, Local Care Direct provides services to local prisons and operates a drug advice line that ensures people get a next working day appointment with the relevant drug intervention teams.\n\tI hope that our Social Enterprise Unit will foster the development of more such businesses - both new social enterprises with something to offer health and social care, or existing providers who adopt the social enterprise model and its benefits, such as more involvement with the local community and greater flexibility to innovate.\n\tWe particularly want to encourage social enterprise organisations that look at the whole spectrum of people's health and social care needs, with a view to providing holistic services.? And we will expect social enterprises to be working closely with partners, whether voluntary, statutory or private.\n\tI also want to talk about some concrete examples of what is happening out there, which I believe is beginning to make a difference.\n\tThe Expert Patients Programme delivers high quality courses that help people with long term conditions manage those conditions better.? Key to the success of its approach was having the course led by a person who themselves had a long term condition.\n\tBecause of its success, we want it to work on a far greater scale - delivering 100,000 course places a year rather than the present 12,000. So we want to liberate it to expand it and to innovate it by creating the first national Community Interest Company - or CIC - to be established in England. The Expert Patients Programme CIC will be better able to market its courses to commissioners.? It will also be able to develop exciting new approaches to self-management that will be more relevant to the young, ethnic minorities and other groups that the traditional NHS sometimes struggles to reach.\n\tThe new Expert Patients Programme CIC will be a value based organisation.? It will operate as a business but with the principal goal of improving the lives of people with long-term health conditions.?\n\tWe have taken what I believe is a good idea behind the Expert Patients Programme and are currently now developing an Expert Carers Programme that will help support the work by the 6 million carers who look after relatives and loved ones, often at a significant cost of their own health and well-being.?\n\tExact details are being developed - however, we hope that this programme will be delivered through the third sector.? We intend to consult widely throughout the year as to the final shape of the programme. But the outcomes are clear. I expect that from next year training for carers to enable them to better care for themselves and those they assist, will be more widely available and of a consistently high quality across the country.\n\tFinally, another concrete example is one that will be announced later on today by the PM.\n\tIf I want to keep my job I am not going to tell you what that announcement is going to be, but I believe it will be seen as very exciting and very significant.\n\tSo colleagues, I believe this is a very exciting time for the future of social care and health care\n\tI believe the challenge is to achieve what people have spoken about over decades, which is the integration of health, not just with social care, but with other community care services. Forr too long we have had a separate siphon in terms of organisations that are all meant to be interacting to support users in our society.\n\tIn a user's and carer's perspective it doesn't matter if the service comes from the NHS, the LA social services department and other departments of the LA, the Third Sector or indeed the private sector: what matters to users and carers is that they get a responsive service.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\tI want to conclude with what I regard our mission is and how I believe we can make it a reality.? That mission is to ensure users and carers have access to services which meet their needs, maximise their quality of life, and offer them dignity and control.\n\tThis mission will require us to enable the third sector to be equal partners in the design and delivery of services and advocates for those who lack a voice or who require a helping hand.? We must consign to history the notion that any organisation or professional, for that matter, has a right to provide soley on the basis of their status or historical monopoly.\n\tAt the same time however we must maintain and develop public accountability for any service offered to the public and funded by the taxpayer.\n\tPartnership, a word that many of you will be familiar with. Partnership must be restored to the noble pursuit it should be rather than the tarnished diluted word it has all too frequently become.? Partnership should be for a purpose, focused on shared outcomes, authentic, with every partner treated with equal respect and value.\n\tNational principles and worthy rhetoric enshrined in the Compact must become a reality in every Government Department, every community and every sector in every part of the country.? We and you didn't sign up to a postcode Compact.\n\tAs we face the challenges of a rapidly changing nation in an ever changing world, let us renew and reinvigorate our commitment to each other.\n\tThere is such a thing as society but society at its best has always been citizens, voluntary groups, businesses, trade unions and the state combining to achieve social justice and prosperity.\n\tTogether I beleive we can change the world whether in the shanty towns of Africa, the disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Britain, or the leafy suburbs of middle England. Let us unite around our enduring values of equality of opportunity, service and community.\n\tTogether let's make it happen\n\tThank you\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n \t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGlobal links\n\n\t\t\tAccessibility\n\tFreedom of Information\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tTerms and conditions\n\t?

First, I am currently a member of the United Methodist church.  I agree with a lot of the teachings and beliefs of the church, however I am finding that the congregations do not always follow the teachings.  After much reflection and many years of feeling drawn to quakerism, I have come to the conclusion that I AM a Quaker.  Unfortunately, there is no meeting house anywhere near where I live (there is an evangelical friends church but I don't agree with their teaching and practices).  My questions are:  can I be a Quaker without having attended a meeting?  What can I do about my isolation?  There is a meeting house just over an hour from me but cannot see making that trip on a weekly basis.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tAtlantaScott\n\n\n\nJoined: 21 Aug 2002\nPosts: 102\nLocation: Atlanta Georgia (Gwinnett County)\n\t\tPosted:  Fri Oct 6, 2006 7:26 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tFriend,\n\n\nThanks for sharing that!  Yes, it is possible...not ideal (how much in life or even if you had a Meeting nearby would be ideal however?)..but possible.  My suggestion is to research, read a lot here and books (Some suggestions are: A Quaker Reader by Jessamyn West, A Living Faith by Wilmer Cooper,  Quaker Spirituality (Douglas V. Steere), and that will keep you busy a while. Then research the various Branches and determine with which Yeary Meeting you are most in unity, (I would love to think you might decide that Conservative Friends---meaning conserving the original testimony and Christian faith of Quakers)---would be what you seek, but maybe that is not the case.  After that decision, then seek out the Monthly Meeting of that Yearly Meeting that best reflects what you seek. Many Conservative MM allow \"affiliate\" membership at a distance!  Some others may as well.  Friends World Committee on Consultation (at www.fwccworld.org) offers membership to scattered Friends as well I think.  You can relax and research now knowing that I guess, with my anwers and that of others, you are NOT alone!!!  Quakers are few in numbers in many areas....there may actually be a few in your area (other than the Evangelicals that you mentioned) that might can help.  You never know.  It might help to mention your location.  Maybe you are called for a purpose where you are, to start a worship group, or just to be there, and ocassionally attend Friends Gatherings when possible.  There are many chances to do so!  Let us know where you are (I forgot, you may have done that when you registered!) and that might help.  If \"Conservative\" seems to best fit you, let me know for more information.  If not, that's quite alright too and know that there are many resources here for all.  I am sure God will lead you where He wants and needs you now, and that's what counts!  Be encouraged!\n\n\n-Scott in Atlanta GA\n\nLast edited by AtlantaScott on  Mon Oct 23, 2006 8:31 pm; edited 2 times in total\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tPulpculture\n\n\n\nJoined: 28 Apr 2003\nPosts: 365\nLocation: England\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Oct 7, 2006 3:02 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tQuaker Online is a good starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of online Quaker setups.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tcigi104\n\n\n\nJoined: 03 Oct 2006\nPosts: 7\n\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Oct 7, 2006 7:58 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThank you Scott and Popculture.  I have been doing much research online and will look into the links and books you mentioned.  I'm not sure what \"conservative\" Quaker means.   I see myself as a Christ-centered Friend who sees the Bible as a guide for life but not to be taken literally - which is why the evangelical friends church would not suit me.  I look to Christ's words to guide me in my daily life - leading me to support peace and social-justice.  The United Methodist church is supposed to support these beliefs, however, I am finding that many members do not.  In addition, I feel like a phoney when involved in the various rituals of the church because I don't believe they are necessary.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\torPowers\n\n\n\nJoined: 25 Aug 2006\nPosts: 133\nLocation: Medford, OR\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Oct 7, 2006 9:15 am    Post subject: community\t   \n\t\n\n\tScott has some very good suggestions, including the idea that you may have a fellowship of like minded believers that meets in your home, or one of the others.  Such contacts may come as you express your convictions to people with whom you share interests.  Another question is whether you could participate in a community with which your views are not in total agreement (have you got siblings, and do you always agree with them?)  For instance, on the question of ceremonies the point is whether you bring to the ceremony the capability of incorporating the spiritual truth that animates it, or whether the thought that it is simply not \"necessary\" keeps you from appreciating what it represents.  On Evangelical Friends, I would suggest that their perception of the place of scripture need not impinge in yours, so long as you are in unity in the love of the Lord and how it is expressed in Meeting.  They might exclude you based on your views, but there is no need to exclude them before you even find out if there is a basis for community.  \"He drew a circle that kept me out, but love and I had the wit to win, we drew a circle that took him in.\"  It distresses me that we seem to have a mindset that we have to be in perfect agreement on everything in order to have \"community.\"\n_________________\nRomans 8:38-39\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tLaurence17\n\n\n\nJoined: 25 Feb 2006\nPosts: 194\nLocation: U.K.\n\t\tPosted:  Sat Oct 7, 2006 9:20 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tWelcome Firend cigl 104\n\n\n\n\n\nI would a little to all the good things offered here, by others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is quite common in the UK for Friends to belong to their original church, as well as the Society-they call it dual membership in Britian.  \n\n\nYou might decide to attend the meeting, that is an hour away, at a regualr interval that works for you. Say fortnightly, monthly or wahtever.  That would  give  a structure. Other sundays you could worship at your church if so led, and  / or  at home alone.  Sometimes, I form an intention, in my mind to   link uip with a MfW happening at this time.  Thus, present in spirit. Also reading a line or 2 from one of the Books of Discipline, or the Advices & Queries, which can aid Worshipping when alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also an on-line Meeting for Worship --Google 'Meeting for Worship on-line U.K. ' and that should get you to the on-line meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may well find it useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nwith best wishes for your journey, Friend\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurence\n_________________\nAbwoon : divine progenitor, breathing mindfulness through poor in spirit and the resonating realm of ruach\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tcigi104\n\n\n\nJoined: 03 Oct 2006\nPosts: 7\n\n\t\tPosted:  Mon Oct 9, 2006 12:34 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tI appreciate all the input.  As far as finding common ground for community, I find most of that within the methodist denomination.  Unlike evangelical friends, methodists do not take scripture literally but interpret it as a guide for our spiritual lives.  However, I'm more drawn to the friends more many other reasons, including simple living and silent prayer.  I find the prayers offered by the pastor and others during service to be distracting to my connection with God.  It is supposed to help us center but I can never get to that point because I'm too busy listening to the prayer rather than receiving God's messsage.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as attending two places of worship, that does seem like a very good option for me.  As I already feel I have 2 churches (I moved to VA from FL and occasional attend service in FL), one more would be a blessing!\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tAtlantaScott\n\n\n\nJoined: 21 Aug 2002\nPosts: 102\nLocation: Atlanta Georgia (Gwinnett County)\n\t\tPosted:  Mon Oct 9, 2006 4:56 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tThere is a small but active Christian Friends presence in Virginia...some around Norfolk area associated with NC Yearly Meeting (www.ncymc.org) and in Harrisonburg VA there is Rockingham MM (www.rockinghamfriends.org) if that helps, and other meetings around as well...\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tquakerponderer\n\n\n\nJoined: 22 Jan 2006\nPosts: 10\n\n\t\tPosted:  Thu Oct 19, 2006 8:10 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tMaybe that meeting that is an hour from you, you could attend there maybe once a month instead of weekly.

I would also suggest that you keep open to the idea of finding people of like mind to meet with even if they don't identify as \"Quakers\" and try to meet regularly.

The work focuses on increasing confidence and self-esteem, reduction of post-natal illness, and improvement in community involvement and positive parenting. It offers one-to-one support and advocacy with disadvantaged young mothers and fathers who have not achieved academically, and their children under 4.\nStaffing details: number of FT/PT/volunteer staff\n4 full-time, 12 part-time and 7 volunteer staff.\nNATURE OF PROVISION\nWhich groups of young people does the project work with and why? \nProject works with targeted, small single-gender groups of young parents under 25.\nHow was the need for the project identified, and by whom? \nYoung parents experience rural isolation, socio-economic deprivation, substandard housing, backgrounds of abuse and family breakdown and low self-esteem. Project works throughout Cornwall, in rural and semi-urban areas with high rates of teenage pregnancy. 90%  of the young mothers it works with have clinical post-natal depression, compared to a national average of 10%.\nHow do young people become involved? What, if any, commitment do you ask for?\nReferral through health visitors, midwives, CPN, social services, plus self-referral through word of mouth. Young people must commit themselves to attending and participating in groups.\nWhat are the main approaches used and activities offered? \nProject offers support and accredited training in life skills through weekly groupwork, together with special projects such as peer education, arts and health.\nHow are young people involved in shaping the project/programme?\nYoung people take an active part on the management committee, and plan and implement their own programme of learning. There are also teams of peer educators who promote its work in local schools and youth venues.\nHow does the project respond to the needs of different young people, particularly the most marginalised?\nApproach allows young people who have been marginalised by education systems  - with many out of academic learning environment since their early teens - to set their own agenda of learning needs and interests and build on their strengths and skills. It takes work to the areas young people live in, using local venues familiar to them, and offers free crèche places and travel expenses. WILD was one of the pilot agencies for Youth Achievement Awards, which offers disadvantaged, educationally alienated young people a chance to achieve through its flexibility, the diversity of achievements which can be recognised, and the control exercised by young people as peer assessors and curriculum setters.\nOUTCOMES OF WORK \nHow do young people benefit from their  involvement in the project? \nYouth Achievement Awards offer accreditation for skills related to their lives, for instance decorating a child's bedroom or organising a birthday party. From these challenges which they view as achievable, the success they gain enables them to move on  to peer education work and challenges more linked to self-development, and move towards FE, employment and voluntary work. 85% of young parents who stay with the project for more than five months move on to further and higher education, employment, self-employment or voluntary work. Many report involvement in the award schemes as a motivating factor in this process. Improved self-esteem as a result of achieving challenges and awards is a key to learners moving on to more academic or vocational training, or seeking employment. Learners also identity participation in WILD as helping them raise their career aspirations  - e.g. teacher training rather than classroom assistant, midwifery training rather than care assistant.\nHow does the project help young people influence services and contribute to decision-making processes in their local area?\nIt undertakes consultation work with other agencies, on areas such as health, education and housing.\nHow are young people's progress and achievements measured and recorded?\nYoung people compile portfolios demonstrating progress against agreed leaning plans. Young people's take-up, motivation and commitment, success and future activities are monitored in accordance with ESF and SRB requirements.\nHow are young people's progress and achievements accredited? \nYoung people offered accreditation through the Youth Achievement Awards, which is directly compatible with NVQ key skills to level 3. Project also offers Btec in peer education.\nMEASURING EFFECTIVENESS\nHow is the project evaluated and by whom? Please include both internal and external processes\nAwards are initially evaluated by young parents' peer award groups. Team of youth workers supports this process, and portfolios are moderated by trained moderators, who attend regular regional and national meetings.\nWhat are the findings of evaluation (including Ofsted inspections) to date?\nOfsted report (2001) noted the youth service's use of accreditation was effective, and young parents received 'timely and practical help'. It concluded that 'the nature of the programmes offered to isolated young mothers at the WILD (women's initiative for learning and development) project in Penzance …reflected their own, and their children's immediate needs.' \nWhat specific management practices and structures help the work?\nStrong sense of team aims and commitment; supportive management; young people's involvement in management.\nWhat specific factors hinder the work?\nLack of core/long-term funding.\nPARTNERSHIP/MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORKING\nWhat other agencies do you work with  (if not specified in section 1)\nFormal partnerships with Surestart, Cornwall College, Brook, and Young People Cornwall. Project has strong local partnerships with midwives, health visitors, community nurses and social workers.\nWhen working in partnership, what is the distinctive contribution of your organisation/project? \nLead provider of specific work with young parents in Cornwall.\nSTRATEGIC IMPACT\nDo you consider this project to be innovative? If so, how?\nYoung people have ownership, and focus is on their development and potential (not a parenting project).\nHow do you disseminate the learning from the project?\nReports, training for other professionals run by young parents.\nHas the learning from this work influenced wider organisational/service strategies? If so, how?\nHas had impact on health visiting and ante-natal services, after training and consultation.\nWhat plans do you have to sustain/develop this work?\nAward scheme is built into core of project's working practice, and is cost effective as a result of the partnership with UK Youth and ASDAN.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nJo Davies, 61 Lemon Street, Truro TR1 2PE.

          "Royal Mail sacks depressed postal worker – Socialist Worker\n\n\n\n» Back to article\n\nSocialist Worker 1943, 19 March 2005 (www.socialistworker.co.uk)\n\nhttp://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=6061\n\nNews & Reports\n\n\n\n\nThis article should be read after: » T-Mobile still won’t talk to communication workers\nRoyal Mail sacks depressed postal worker\n\n\nSouth Shields postal worker dismissed without notice\n\nJimmy Wilson\n\n\nI have been employed as a reserve delivery worker for two years at South Shields delivery office, north east England.\n\nFor over a year I have been suffering from depression and I had a nervous breakdown.\n\nSince the breakdown I have found it increasingly difficult to perform my role due to the heavy workload. I have been on the sick from my job and I have not been offered alternative work.\n\nAfter a period of sickness I tried to do different rounds, which I was unfamiliar with, but I was unable to cope. I was charged with unexcused delay of the mail in September and October last year.\n\nI was suspended from duty and my mental health problems got worse, so I went sick again. Royal Mail continued my suspension and told me weekly that I was suspended, despite having a long term sick note.\n\nManagement tried to press me into attending disciplinary hearings, despite my doctor stating that I wasn’t up to it.\n\nMy union has advised me not to co-operate until my mental health is better. My local community mental health worker has written to management stating that further pressure on me by Royal Mail will exacerbate  my symptoms and hinder  my recovery.\n\nManagement then tried to get me to take part in a hearing by post. But once again I refused as I didn’t feel well enough.\n\nI received a letter last week stating that I had been dismissed without notice and my mental health illness could not be used as mitigation.\n\nI feel disgusted that I have been treated this way despite having attended no hearing and being on sick leave. I would hate to see Royal Mail get away with this with any other postal workers.\nMessages of support to jimmycpwilson73@yahoo.co.uk\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\ttop of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

Following their five-hour \n                      flight, the elephants have been quarantined on the Cocos \n                      Islands in the Indian Ocean before being permanently relocated \n                      to enclosures at Melbourne Zoo and Sydney’s Taronga \n                      Zoo, under the \"Joint Cooperation in Captive Animal \n                      Management Programmes between Australia and Thailand\" \n                      exchange agreement.\n\n                     The elephants were secretly transported \n                      from Mahidol University's animal hospital in Sai Yok district \n                      to the U-Tapao International Airport in Chon Buri under \n                      cover of darkness. Although the 50-strong group of conservationists \n                      who had temporarily halted the shipment from Kanchanaburi \n                      in June remained in attendance, over 100 police and army \n                      officials guarded a different exit as the elephants were \n                      transferred unopposed. Four of the elephants were flown \n                      out immediately while the others are being kept in a small \n                      forest behind the airport.\n\n                     The transparency of the deal has been called \n                      into question by protesters. A particular concern raised \n                      previously by Born Free and other organisations was the \n                      parentage of some of the elephants, which remains unclear. \n                      The illegal international trade in wild baby elephants is \n                      a well known problem in the region, and so calls for DNA \n                      tests seemed, to us and many others, justified. However, \n                      so far, no such tests have been undertaken despite assurances \n                      to the contrary from the zoos in question and Thailand’s \n                      Minister for Natural Resources and the Environment. The \n                      authorities claim the export will improve bilateral relations \n                      through a wildlife exchange programme that will, allegedly, \n                      involve four koalas moving from Australia to the controversial \n                      Chiang Mai Night Safari (the same Thai zoo that wants to \n                      import 170 wild animals from Kenya). However, if the elephants \n                      are proven to be wild-born, their export would represent \n                      a severe contravention of the Convention on International \n                      Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\n\n                     In a defiant attempt to return the elephants to Thailand \n                      for DNA testing, the Kanchanaburi Conservation Group plans \n                      to file a law suit against those institutions involved, \n                      including the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, \n                      the Department of Natural Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, \n                      and the Zoological Park Organisation.\n\n                     As if to add to the controversy surrounding this ill-fated \n                      project, Australian news reports have revealed that the \n                      first attempt at artificial insemination of an Asian elephant \n                      in Australia failed only two days after the Thai export \n                      took place. With the zoos using their planned breeding programmes \n                      as justification for the shipment, this failure seriously \n                      undermines claims that the Thai elephant transfer will enhance \n                      elephant conservation or, indeed, lead to a self-sustaining \n                      captive elephant population in Australia as the zoos have \n                      claimed. \n\n                    Born Free strongly believes that it is a step backwards \n                      and that conservation efforts should be focused on protecting \n                      Thailand’s national symbol in its natural habitat. \n                      Born Free also holds the two importing zoos, and the government \n                      officials and politicians who sanctioned this initiative, \n                      personally responsible for the future of these unfortunate \n                      animals.\n\n                        \n\n                    For more about this issue see:\n\n                     \n\n                    Humane Society International Australian Office - \n                      http://www.hsi.org.au/\n\n                      \n\n                      \n                    \n\n                  \n\n                \n\n              \n\n              \n\n                   \n                    printer friendly version\n\n                     \n                      \n                    \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n\n                      \n\n                      \n\n                    \n\n\n                    \n\n                  \n\n\n                \n\n\n              \n\n\n            \n\n\n\n        \n\n          < Back / News \n\n            / Elefriends\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n          \n\n \n\t\n      \n\n        NEWS \n        | CAMPAIGNS | EDUCATION \n        | GET INVOLVED | EXTRAS\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n \n          \t \n                \n        © 2007 Born Free Foundation. \n          Charity registration no.1070906 \n          Home | Search Site | Contact Born \n          Free\n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n        \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So the London Games will transform the lives of all those it touches not just in this generation, but in the next generation of young athletes and fans,\" Coe told delegates.\n The presentation of the London 2012 Bid the fourth British Bid in 20 years - also included addresses from Craig Reedie, Chairman of the British Olympic Association and Keith Mills, Chief Executive and International President, who told delegates that the London Bid had negotiated legally binding agreements that would guarantee fixed and fair prices for hotel accommodation with no minimum stay requirements.\n \"We've been working hard to deliver the best ever experience for national Olympic committees,\" Mills said.\n London's presentation also stressed that rooms for athletes in the London Olympic Village to be converted into private homes and affordable housing after the Games - would be the most spacious ever, with air conditioning, carpeted and properly furnished with broadband internet access and TVs carrying free feeds from national broadcasters.\n The London Olympic Bid presentation also included a video message of welcome from London's Oceania communities, highlighting the passion within London's ethnically diverse communities for bringing the Olympic Games to the United Kingdom in 2012 and the 'home crowd' reception that would be given to Olympic athletes and teams.\n -ends-\n ***Please Note: High quality broadcast digital video material and images of Cathy Freeman's video message of support for the London bid and other bid-related video information can be accessed by media FREE of charge by registering at www.thenewsmarket.com\n Further images and information about the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Bid can be accessed by visiting the official website at www.London2012.com\n For further information: please contact the London 2012 Press Office on + 44 20 7093 5100 or Michael Pirrie on +44 (0)7867 504856 (in Australia) or Jackie Brock-Doyle on +44 (0)787 678 5756 (in London).\n   \n      \n\t \n      Print \npage\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLink To Us\n\tSite Map\n\tFAQ\n\tAccessibility\n\tPrivacy Policy\n\tTerms and Conditions\n\tContact Us\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe official site of the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games\t \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tback to top\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

Two of them are  from Yorkshire, Tess Ellison and James Taylor. \n\n\n\n16 year-old Tess Ellison has been brought up with theatre as an important part of her life, and has loved both watching plays and acting ever since she can remember. She is very active within drama at her school, taking part in two National Shakespeare School’s Festivals and running a drama club for years 7, 8 and 9 in partnership with a friend. Previously a member of York Youth Theatre, Tess is now with Riding Lights Youth Theatre. She believes it is difficult to find a better way to explore issues and emotions, and also to escape from yourself, than through theatre.\n\n\n\nJames Taylor describes himself as a 19-year-old theatre fanatic. Connected with Calderdale Theatre School he has recently finished his final year with the organisation and is hoping to return to work with them as a teaching assistant this year. James lived in Manchester and participated in a drama school there but moved to Yorkshire when he was ten. He has worked on several productions with groups such as Mischief La Bas, Calderdale Theatre School and Huddersfield New College. Currently taking a gap year, James wishes to take creative writing and drama for his degree and is working on a political script for the Royal Theatre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTess and James will also form part of a regional youth council which will develop youth and participatory theatre practice in Yorkshire. This regional council is part of a network of YPPT youth councils established across each of the nine Arts Council regions.\n\n\n\nThe YPPT project will work to create opportunities and broaden the range of theatre in which young people can participate as well as strengthening its links with the mainstream theatre industry.  It will also explore opportunities for young people interested in working in theatre and will focus on the full range of theatre practice including circus and street arts.\n\n\n\nPeter Hewitt, Chief Executive, Arts Council England, says; ‘Young people are at the heart of participatory theatre in England.  I’m delighted that we will be working with such a talented and enthusiastic group of young people on this project.\n\n\n\n‘Youth Theatre is one of the most innovative and creative areas of theatre in this country, yet while much important work is happening, more needs to be done to strengthen and build the sector so that we can increase the opportunities for all young people to engage with and enjoy theatre.’\n\n\n\nNotes for editors: \n\n\tArts Council England works to get more art to more people in more places. We develop and promote the arts across England, acting as an independent body at arm’s length from government. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tBetween 2006 and 2008, we will invest £1.1 billion of public money from government and the National Lottery in supporting the arts. This is the bedrock of support for the arts in England.

It?s time to make sure you?re in the first group. Smoking is the biggest single preventable killer in the UK. It's responsible for one in five deaths while someone who smokes 20 a day will spend about ?1,480 a year on cigarettes.\n\nMen particulary need to quit. We?re heavier smokers than women - consuming about 16 fags a day compared to 14 among female smokers - and it plays havoc with our sex-lives. Male smokers appear more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than non-smokers - a 1994 study of US army veterans found that 3.7% of smokers were impotent compared to 2.2% of non-smokers - and have less-mobile, more abnormal sperm in a poorer sperm density. Not good for baby-making.\n\nWhat happens when you give up smoking\n\nYour buddies\nTextotine\nNational No Smoking Day and the mobile innovation agency Keitai Culture announce the launch of Textotine - a mobile quitting assistant. The text message message-based service allows smokers wishing to quit to request motivational messages and personalised success metrics from their very own virtual quitting buddy. Register for textotine at www.nosmokingday.org.uk.\n\nReady To Quit booklet\nLloydspharmacy has produced a new FREE booklet called Ready to Quit which you can use to create your own personalised quitting plan. There are a series of questions to answer which your local pharmacist can assess and recommend appropriate help to get you through the cravings. \n\nMalehealth\nNo need to go anywhere.

The challenge is to make choice available to all.\nWhat we're aiming for:\n\tBy the summer of 2004, all patients waiting six months for surgery should benefit from the choice to move to another hospital or provider. In this way, those waiting longest will benefit first from choice.\n\tFrom December 2005, all patients requiring surgery will be offered a choice of providers, when they are referred for treatment by their GP. These providers could include different NHS trusts, diagnosis and treatment centres, specialists and independent hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChoice and booking\nPatients will need to be supported in making their choices. By December 2005, a new electronic booking system will enable GPs and other primary care professionals to book patients' hospital and other appointments direct from their surgery. Information on waiting times is already available to patients on www.nhs.uk. More detailed information, providing everything the patient needs to make an informed choice, will become available and will be incorporated into the booking software.\nThe system will also enable patients to book from home or work by calling a contact centre. They will be able to make or change appointments by email and subsequently through digital television and other developing technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n \t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAdditional links\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRelated Links\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChoice\n\tNHS Plan booking systems\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGlobal links\n\n\t\t\tAccessibility\n\tFreedom of Information\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tTerms and conditions\n\t© Crown Copyright 2007\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tContact us\n\n\tHelp\n\n\tSite map\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSearch this site\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAdvanced search\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tAccess keys\n\n\t\t\tHome\n\tNewsroom\n\tSite map\n\tFrequently asked questions\n\tHelp\n\tComplaints procedure\n\tTerms and conditions\n\tFeedback form\n\tAccess key details\n\tBack to main menu\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n",

The London County Council\nare about to widen and improve the Archway Road, and to alter and reconstruct\nthe viaduct which carries Hornsey Lane over it. The Cost of the work is\nestimated at £27,000, which will be jointly defrayed by the Middlesex County\nCouncil, the Vestry of Islington, the Hornsey Local Board the Ecclesiastical\nCommissioners, and the London County Council, who will pay the greatest share.\nThis authority was authorised to effect the improvement by an Act of Parliament\npassed in 1894. It must be owned that, picturesque as is the Archway, it ought,\nin the public interests, to have been reconstructed long ago.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This was necessary to seal the flood bank from the rising tide. A flap gate closes when the tide rises thus sealing the stream culvert through the flood defence.\n\nHowever, the Cone Pill creek is home to a small population of sea trout whose migration route would be interrupted when the flap gate is closed by the tide. Migration routes should not, by law, be impeded, so a solution was needed.\n\nA high-tech innovation was found from the United States. A Self-Regulating Tide Gate (SRT) was installed in conjunction with the standard flap gate on the outfall. The SRT allows tidal water to pass through the floodbank – but to a set upstream height. When this is reached, a float tilt switch is triggered and the gate is closed preventing flooding.\n\nThe SRT works without an electricity supply, thus greatly reducing the installation and maintenance costs.\n\nAs the normal height tides are allowed to flush through the outfall, the trout can continue to migrate through the flood defence.\n\nAn additional benefit is that a small area of salt marsh behind the defence can be supported, creating a habitat for other migrating fish species, such as flounder, gobies and eels.\n\n \n\n \n\n   \n \n  \n\t\t  \n  \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\t\t\tAdditional links: regional information\n \n \n   \n    Anglian | Midlands | North East | North West | South West | Southern | Thames | Wales\n \n  \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tBack to top of page\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    ©The Environment Agency 2007\n \n\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t      Privacy Policy\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t    Author: John Cowdrey | john.cowdrey@environment-agency.gov.uk\n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t",

My terms of reference were:\n“To review and make recommendations on the degree to which current rules in England and\nWales on the movement of cattle, sheep and deer deliver a sufficiently reduced risk of disease,\ntaking account of the need to support the sustainability of the livestock industry. In particular the\nreview should address the risks being managed by the controls, the benefits of the controls, the\nadministrative burden created by them, and the way in which they have influenced farmer\nbehaviour, including the levels of compliance with them, and make recommendations.\nOut of scope of the review is consideration of the length of movement standstills applicable to\nany species. This is because the six day standstill periods were introduced in 2003 following\nextensive work to identify the costs and benefits of having such an approach. The Report\nrecommended that a standstill period of 20 days provided the best disease protection, but that a\nsix day standstill period provided worthwhile protection against the spread of disease. These\nresults are still valid.  \nThe secretariat for the review will be provided by Animal Identification and Movements Division\nof Defra. The review will commence in February 2006, and report by the end of June 2006”.\nI have addressed each of the issues in my terms of reference. Perhaps inevitably I received less\ndata on levels of compliance, although I am grateful to those who supplied me, in confidence,\ndetails of ways the current rules are being evaded. I have not covered this subject explicitly in my\nreport. But the detail that I have been given has strongly influenced my conclusions in other\nareas. Whilst consideration of the length of movement standstill is still out of scope of my review,\nI have made a recommendation on an alternative way to achieve the standstill. \nTo achieve my objective I sent a short questionnaire (see Annex A) to a number of organisations\nand individuals, and met several of them. To those who completed the questionnaire, or who\ntook the time to meet me, I am profoundly grateful.\nFinally I should like to thank Andrew Beech, Lyn Haywood, Olu Ogunbadejo, Renée Raiser and\nStephanie Jean from Defra who assisted me in my work.\nThroughout this report a number of acronyms have been used for the sake of brevity.

The industry\nhas been devastated in the recent past by a major foot and mouth disease outbreak and is\njust emerging from 10 years of trading restrictions caused by BSE. Cattle keepers have the\nongoing scourge of bovine TB to contend with. In addition less headline grabbing diseases\ncan be spread from farm to farm, for example IBR, BVD, leptospirosis and sheep scab\namongst others.\n1.3 However moving stock from breeding and rearing farms to finishing units, from the hills to\nthe lowlands, from rearing farms to sheep flocks and dairy and suckler herds are all\nessential elements to a successful livestock industry.\n1.4 The pig and poultry industries have vertically integrated to great extent. The scope for the\ncattle and sheep industries to do so is more limited. It has happened to a degree in the\ndairy sector but even here calves and other stock often move to other farms for rearing\nand further finishing.\n1.5 The aim must be to facilitate the necessary economic activities of the livestock industry,\nincluding the movement of stock, while mitigating the risk of disease spread. Auction\nmarkets have an important role to play in matching buyer and seller and also in\nestablishing values of stock traded, both through the markets and elsewhere.\n1.6 Livestock marketing groups and dealers/stock agents provide a valuable service in sourcing\nand supplying stock, matching the needs of rearing farms and others selling and for\nexample fattening units buying\n1.7 The keys to the prevention and control of disease are good biosecurity, not allowing\nanimals to move more than once per week, the appropriate use of isolation facilities and\nknowing what is where and when i.e. as near to a real time database as possible.\nThe Livestock Movements Rules\n1.8 The animal health movement controls currently imposed by Defra and WAG collectively\nhave as their main objectives to achieve improved notifiable disease control through:\n• a lower risk of outbreaks\n• quicker control of outbreaks\n• reduced cost of outbreaks\nA second objective is to achieve this by imposing as low an administrative burden for\nfarmers as possible, with minimum compliance costs both for farmers and regulators.\n3Chapter 1\n1.9 The rules in place have been built up piecemeal over a number of years. Those applicable to\ncattle were put in place in the late 1990s to control BSE. Essentially all movements of cattle\nbetween businesses, and within a business between separate premises (holdings) managed\nby that business should be reported to BCMS, now part of the RPA. Details of such\nmovements are entered onto CTS, a database owned by BCMS. In the interest of reducing\nthe burden imposed on cattle farmers, a number of exemptions have been made to this\nbasic rule, involving movements between what have come to be known as “linked\nholdings”. These are summarised at Annex B. It will already have become clear that there is\nconfusion over the terminology used to describe places, with “premises” and “holdings”\nespecially causing difficulty. This issue, and a solution to it, is described later in this report.\n1.10 These controls remained in place during and after the major outbreak of FMD that\naffected large parts of GB in 2001. Other controls were introduced at that time that have,\nas will be explained later, served to complicate matters for those farming cattle.\n1.11 The rules applicable to the movement of sheep and goats were minimal prior to 2001.\nBut FMD acted as the catalyst for a major overhaul of the rules then, and a number of\nchanges have been made to the rules since.  \n1.12 These rules applicable to the movement of sheep have been complicated by the rules for\nthe identification of sheep. These have changed a number of times since 2001, notably\nwith the introduction of EU rules in 2005, but the new rules have never been applied\nretrospectively to sheep from before their introduction. There are thus four distinct age\ncohorts of sheep subject to different ID rules. This complicates the reporting of sheep\nmovements, as will be described below.\n1.13 The primary change made at the time of the FMD outbreak in 2001 was the introduction\nof livestock movement standstills. At first these were set at the level that has applied in\nthe pig industry since 1975- 20 days. This confusingly, is also known as a 21 day standstill\n– the difference resulting from whether or not the day on which the movements takes\nplace is included. The 20 day standstill was reduced to six for cattle, sheep and goats, and\nto zero for deer in March 2003.\n1.14 The default rule for the movement of these species is:\n• no movement may take place off a premises that is under movement standstill;\n• all movements must be reported (sheep, goat and deer to the LA, cattle to BCMS);\n• all movements will impose a standstill on the premises of destination.\nMovements of species other than cattle are entered onto AMLS by the LA. This is another\ndatabase, now owned by BCMS. AMLS checks each movement reported to it to ensure\nthat it took place from a premises that was not under standstill, and records the existence\nof a standstill on the premises of destination. AMLS captures cattle movements by means of\na daily download of data from CTS, and carries out standstill checks on these movements.\n1.15 There are a considerable number of exemptions to these rules. These are set out at Annex C.\n1.16 In the Spring of 2006, pre-movement testing of cattle over 15 months for bovine TB was\nintroduced. From March 2007 this will apply to cattle over 6 weeks. Pre-movement testing\nis generally required when cattle move from farms in parishes subject to one or two year\ntesting frequency.\n4Chapter 1\n1.17 A different movement regime applies in Scotland. The Disease Control (Interim Measures)\n(Scotland) Order 2002 was introduced in February 2002 when Foot and Mouth Disease\nrestrictions were lifted. It provides that animals may only move under licence and imposes\nstandstills when animals are brought onto holdings. The standstill period is 13 days for\ncattle, sheep and goats, but 20-days for pigs. Animals placed in approved separation units\ntrigger a standstill on the unit rather than the entire holding.  \n1.18 Scotland has a number of exemptions from the standstill provisions e.g. the movement \nof animals going direct to slaughter or animals moving direct from premises to a market\nfor animals intended for immediate slaughter; young lambs and calves for fostering;\nbreeding bulls, rams and goats; animals going to AI centres or for veterinary treatment;\nshow/exhibition animals unless going to another show within 13 days; away-wintered\nsheep returning home from wintering and animal movements between premises on which\na right of grazing in common with other proprietors.\n1.19 Pre and post-movement testing of cattle for bovine TB is required for cattle over 6 weeks\ncoming from parishes in England and Wales where one or two year testing frequency applies.\n5Chapter 2\nBusiness and Place Identifiers\n2.1 For any movement reporting system to work it is important to know where animals are\nmoving between. The system of identifiers used throughout GB originated in the 1940s,\nand allocated, for each country and each parish within that country, a holding number to\neach farm. This is the farm’s CPH number.\n2.2 The structure of the agriculture industry has changed markedly since the 1940s, but the\nCPH number structure has not kept pace. Many farming businesses occupy several parcels\nof land at a distance from each other. A family farm may have a number of distinct\nbusinesses operating from it. Each family member will have been treated as a separate\nbusiness for subsidy payment and taxation purposes. Each of these would have been\nallocated a separate CPH.\n2.3 In England the allocation of CPHs is the responsibility of RPA and in Wales this is undertaken\nby WAG Rural Payments Division. Their rules state that, where a business has two parcels of\nland that are less than ten miles apart these can be included within a single CPH. If the two\nparcels are more than ten miles apart they must be given separate CPHs. With the pressure\nto simplify the previous subsidy payment arrangements it is clear that these rules have not\nbeen universally applied. There are many businesses that have land more than ten miles\napart under a single CPH. The RPA are now applying their rules more rigorously.\n2.4 Livestock movements, where they have to be reported, are currently reported as being\nfrom one CPH to another. The AMLS database checks that first CPH to see whether it is\nunder standstill, and imposes as standstill on the second. For some farmers there is clearly\na temptation to avoid effective movement standstills by having more than one CPH. In this\nway a movement could be reported onto one of the CPHs, but a second movement could\ntake place off the same farming unit, within the standstill period, by being reported as\nbeing made off the second CPH. Evidence has been presented to the Review that this is\nhappening.\n2.5 A word about definitions is needed at this point. The basic building block of land\nidentification is the “land parcel”. This is a piece of land with a definably boundary that\ncan be readily identified in situ. Usually a field, it can also be a building. The word\n“holding” has traditionally (in GB) been used to refer to the whole of a business. This is\nthe way the word is used by those within the industry themselves. Thus, however\nwidespread the land used by a business may be, it is all considered to be one “holding”.\n2.6 But “holding” has a much looser definition in the European law relating to livestock\nmovements. In this “holding” means “any establishment, any structure, or in the case of\nfree-range farming, any environment, in which animals are held, reared or handled on a\npermanent or temporary basis, except veterinary practices or clinics”. This has been\ninterpreted by the European Commission, and especially by their auditors the FVO, in a\nmuch narrower way than the traditional understanding of the term. Essentially any group\nof land parcels managed by one business, but separated from the other land parcels\nmanaged by the same business, is considered to be a separate “holding”. Thus, in the\nCommission’s interpretation, a business may constitute more than one holding.\n6Chapter 2\n2.7 As part of its work to define businesses, and the land they farm, the RPA has defined a\nthree-tier structure to enable consistent identification of pieces of land and to link these to\na farm business. This is shown diagrammatically at Figure 1.\n2.8 The recommendations in respect of the Livestock Movement Units that are made in\nchapter 4 of this report depend upon consistent treatment of premises identifiers. The\nthree-tier structure designed by the RPA would provide this essential baseline although for\nthe purposes of reporting livestock movements the production unit layer would be\nreplaced by Livestock Movement Units that consist of land parcels which are\nepidemiologically linked.  \nRecommendation 1\nI recommend that Defra and WAG ensure that for all existing and new livestock businesses,\ntheir land occupancy be recorded in the format of the new structure, and that livestock\nmovements be reported to the livestock movement databases using the new Livestock\nMovement Unit identifiers.\nFigure 1\nGiven a Single\nFarm Business \nBusiness Identifier\n(SBI)\nProduction Unit =\nProduction Unit Production Unit\na group of land\nparcels\nLand Parcels\nLand Parcel\nLand Parcel Land Parcel\nUsually a single\nfield or building.\nIdentified by O.S.\nN. Grid reference\n7Chapter 3\nFindings – Livestock Movements\n3.1 The evidence presented to the Review pointed to a desire on the part of most livestock\nfarmers to comply with the rules, subject to a number of conditions:\na) that they understand why the rules are in place and agree that these are necessary;\nb) that they are seen to impose the minimum constraints on farming businesses to\nachieve their objective;\nc) that they are consistent as between livestock species; and \nd) that they are enforced consistently.\n3.2 It is clear that many livestock farmers find the existing rules highly confusing. The\nsummaries at Annexes B and C show the complexity of the rules. It is also clear, however,\nthat removing complexity altogether would make it impossible for some businesses to\ncontinue. The basic rule is a simple one; that all movements must be reported, that only\nmovements from premises not under standstill are allowed, and that all movements will\nimpose a standstill on the premises of destination. The complexity arises from the various\nexemptions from this basic rule. Removing these exemptions would cause serious difficulty\nfor the many businesses that benefit from them. (See Annex C).\nLinkages between Premises\n3.3 Many of the exemptions are straightforward, readily understandable and it would seem\nsensible to allow them to continue. In this review I have concentrated on the three that\nare inter-related, that are the most complicated and confusing, that could be exploited by\nthe unscrupulous few to avoid the impact of the movement standstills, and that cause the\ngreatest difficulty for the management of mixed farms. These are:\n• SOAs\n• Linked holdings for cattle; and\n• The five mile rule for sheep and goats.\nWhat each of these are, and how they work, is explained in Annexes B and C. The problem\nfor farmers seems to be in how they work together. The following diagram demonstrates\nthe complexity of it all. Despite appearances this is by no means an unlikely scenario,\nalthough Defra are unable to provide data on how many such complex cases actually exist.\n3.4 In Figure 2, premises A, B, C and D are all under the management and control of a single\nbusiness. All four are populated with sheep; D also has a dairy unit. A, B and C also have\nbeef cattle. E is also a dairy farm, but under the management and control of a different\nbusiness. A and B are within five miles of each other; C and D are not, and are also more\nthan five miles from A or B. A, B, C and D are linked in a SOA; D and E are linked cattle\nholdings, because E has no milking parlour and, by agreement, uses that at D twice a day.\nA, B, C and D are also linked to cattle holdings.\n8Chapter 3\nFigure 2 \nPremises A Premises B Premises C Premises D Premises E\nLand used for\nLivestock Keeping\nStandstill Domain 1\nMovement Domain 2\nMovement Domain 3\n3.5 Under the existing rules:\n• movements of sheep between either A or B do not have to be reported, and do not\nimpose a standstill;\n• movements of sheep between either A or B and either of C and D do have to be\nreported, but do not impose a standstill;\n• movements of cattle between A,B,C and D not have to be reported, and do not\nimpose a standstill;\n• movements of cattle between D and E do not have to be reported, and do not impose\na standstill;\n• movements of cattle between A,B,C or D and E do have to be reported, and do\nimpose a standstill;\n• movements of sheep between A,B,C or D and E do have to be reported and do impose\na standstill.\nGiven this, it is hardly surprising that farmers find the rules confusing.\n3.6 Furthermore, these arrangements are intended to allow an exemption from movement\nreporting and standstill where disease risk is sufficiently low. But they do so imprecisely,\nand inconsistently. The five mile rule for sheep and goats contains an arbitrary cut-off at\nfive miles. But there will be some businesses with premises closer than that between\nwhich it would be desirable to require reporting of movements (because of the way the\nbusiness is operated); there will be others where it would be acceptable to allow\nmovements of over five miles not to be reported. For cattle linked holdings the equally\narbitrary cut-off point was set at 25 miles, and for SOA’s there is no cut-off point at all.\nThere used to be one, set at 50km, but this was abolished in 2003.\n9Chapter 3\n3.7 In my terms of reference I was asked to report on the level of compliance with the existing\ncontrols. As in any case of attempting to assess the level at which illegal activity is taking\nplace this is fraught with difficulty, and it is certain that there are no reliable figures\navailable for the level of non-compliance.\n3.8 Evidence has been given to the review that some keepers have obtained multiple CPHs,\nwhich are routinely used to circumvent the movement standstill rules. One keeper\nadmitted to having six CPHs, effectively one for each day of the week. Those CPHs are not\nnecessarily on an identical piece of land but they are on land that is epidemiologically\nlinked. Because these CPHs are not linked on AMLS, stock is effectively moving on and off\nthis keepers’ premises on a continuous basis. It is not known how widespread this practice\nis, but it seems to be used by some at least of those who deal in livestock or who act as\npurchasing agents on behalf of others. This practice increases disease risk, because\ndiseased animals bought onto a dealers or traders; premises would spread disease to other\nlivestock that are moved off without the standstill delay during which disease could\nbecome evident. Were there to be another FMD outbreak, this practice could mean that\nthe disease would have spread further before discovery than would have been the case\nhad the standstills been observed.\n3.9 Evidence has also been presented that the three-day rule for reporting movements of cattle\nto BCMS is laxly applied. Thus a movement off a premises may be reported correctly, as\nhaving been made off a premises on day 1, and the same cattle reported having arrived on\nanother premises on day 3 or even later. It is inconceivable that these cattle will have been\non a truck for all that time. It is highly likely that the cattle will have spent some time on an\ninterim premises (perhaps those of a dealer or trader) whose identity is never reported. \n3.10 This practice, too, risks expanding the scale of a disease outbreak. If one or other of these\ncattle were to be found to be carrying disease, the premises from which they were reported\nto have moved off would, correctly, be investigated as a possible source of disease. But,\nbecause its very existence is unknown, the interim premises on which the cattle had been\nwould not be investigated, neither could all the other animals on that premises with which\nthose cattle might have had contact be able to be investigated. This practice, therefore,\nadds significantly to the risk that agriculture departments are seeking to reduce.\n10Chapter 4\nRecommendations – Livestock Movements\n4.1 It is clear from the evidence present in Chapter 3 that changes need to be made to the\nrules relating to livestock movements. These take three forms:\na. simplification of the rules to enable livestock keepers to understand them, and their\nown responsibilities under them;\nb. measures to enable trading practices that the industry find convenient or necessary to\nenable them to retain (or to maximise) profitability to continue or to become legitimate\nwhilst minimising disease risk;\nc. measures that Defra and its agencies can themselves take to identify more accurately\nthe places between which livestock are moved, to improve traceability, and to improve\nthe chances that livestock keepers will understand and comply with their reporting\nobligations.\n4.2 I have not considered it within my terms of reference to recommend that the livestock\nindustry should restructure itself and its activities so as to minimise disease risk.\nAccordingly my recommendations are primarily designed to enable the industry in its\npresent form to comply better with simpler movement rules. However, there is pressure\nfrom food retailers and others to reduce the number of livestock movements and to\nshorten the red meat chain. For example, it is more common in some countries for\nlivestock to be finished on the farm of birth and go direct to slaughter. Also while the\nexperience of electronic auctions and internet trading of livestock in the UK has been\nmixed, other countries successfully use these methods which can reduce animal contact\nand hence disease risk. \n4.3 The review will deal first with the complexity of the existing rules. This complexity is\nespecially acute for keepers who have mixed holdings of cattle and sheep. It is clear that\nthe existing rules have a degree of arbitrariness about them that needs to be replaced by a\nmeasure that requires movements to be reported only where the risk can objectively be\nassessed to be higher. \nRecommendation 2\nI recommend that all existing SOAs and linked holdings for cattle, and the five mile rule for\nsheep and goats be abolished and replaced by Livestock Movement Units (LMUs). These will\nconsist of all those land parcels and buildings which are farmed as a single unit and are linked\nepidemiologically.\nRecommendation 3\nI recommend that LMUs be registered on a database (e.g. RITA). Changes in occupancy of Land\nParcels including seasonal lets, should be reported to the database, which should then be\nupdated accordingly. SVS and Local Authorities to get appropriate access to the database.\n11Chapter 4\n4.4 An LMU would in most cases be a single premises or linked premises under the\nmanagement and control of a single business. But in the case of common land or shared\nseasonal grazing, there is a case where it would be desirable to allow them to include\npremises managed and controlled by more than one business.\n4.5 The criteria for defining an LMU are simple. All premises must be linked epidemiologically,\nbiosecure and been found to be so by a qualified person. This could include self\ndeclaration for those keepers that do not have a SOA or CTS linked premises. However,\nthese must be followed up by an inspection by a qualified person. \na. Movements of stock between the premises within an LMU:\n• would not have to be recorded in the farm movement records;\n• would not have to be reported to the LA or BCMS as appropriate;\n• would not have to respect any standstill on the premises of departure; and\n• would not impose a standstill on the premises of destination.\nA change of keeper of livestock within an LMU would have to be recorded and reported\nbut would not impose a standstill.\nb. Movements of stock onto the LMU from outside and movements of stock off the \nLMU to a destination outside it including movements between LMUs within the same\nfarm business:\n• would have to be recorded in the farm movement records;\n• would have to reported to the LA or BCMS as appropriate;\n• would have to respect any standstill on the premises of departure; and\n• would impose a standstill on the premises of destination.\nNo premises should be in more than one LMU.\n4.6 For premises to qualify for inclusion in an LMU:\n• all of the animals should be under the day-to-day control of the same person(s);\n• should only include premises between which stock are regularly moved.\nFurthermore, all of the premises concerned;\n• should share such of the farm machinery as comes regularly into contact with livestock;\n• should share facilities such as cattle crushes or sheep handling facilities;\n• should have stock-proof barriers against adjacent land not within the proposed LMU;\n• should have a named veterinary practice responsible for the livestock in the LMU; \n• where cattle are present on any of the premises in the LMU all the premises must fall\neither within a one or two year TB testing regime or a three or four year TB testing\nregime and the herd testing interval on all parts should be that of the “highest” risk.\n12Chapter 4\nWithin each LMU there must be adequate facilities for the purpose of inspection, isolation,\nloading, marshalling, watering, feeding and housing of stock, and for the treatment of\nsick or injured animals. Once approved the existence and extent of an LMU should be\nrecorded on the appropriate Defra livestock movement databases. It would be good\npractice for cattle kept within the proposed LMU not to be able to have nose to nose\ncontact with cattle outside the proposed LMU.\n4.7 The purpose of allowing any exemptions form the basic rule applicable to livestock\nmovements is to allow farming activity to take place whilst keeping disease risk to\nacceptable levels. A knowledge of, and compliance with, basic on-farm biosecurity is an\nimportant part of minimising disease risk.  \nRecommendation 4\nI recommend that the keeper responsible for the animals in the LMU should: \n• demonstrate that he or she understands the rules relating to biosecurity, animal movements\nand good farming practice; \n• have and follow a control strategy to minimise the risk of introducing or spreading disease.\n4.8 Each potential LMU needs to be assessed by a properly qualified person to ensure that the\ncriteria for inclusion are met. Veterinary surgeons are clearly qualified to determine whether\npremises are epidemiologically linked.  But, given a clear set of criteria such as those set out\nin paragraphs 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 above, I believe that other groups of people could also be\nsuitably qualified e.g. surveyors, land agents, UKAS approved farm inspectors and SVS\nAnimal Health Officers. Self declaration by the keeper should also be considered where a\nkeeper does not have a SOA or CTS linked premises. However, this must be followed up by\nan inspection by a qualified person. It will take time to approve all of the LMUs.\nRecommendation 5\nI recommend that Defra and WAG set a time limit by when the approval process should be\ncomplete. The existing SOAs, cattle linked holdings and the five mile rule for sheep to continue\nduring this period. \n4.9 Some dairy enterprises that are not under the same management and control share a\nmilking parlour. It would clearly be absurd to require the movement of cattle to be reported\neach time they are taken for milking. And the imposition of a standstill would effectively\nmean that cattle, having been taken for milking, could not return home for six days.  \nRecommendation 6\nI recommend that such moves be exempt from movement reporting and standstill under the\nDisease Control (England) Order 2003 and Disease Control (Wales) Order 2003, but only where\nthey occur between approved pairs of premises within a single LMU. To prevent any inadvertent\nspread of disease, that the premises involved, both the one with the milking parlour and the one\nwithout, be excluded from eligibility for inclusion in another LMU. As stated above, any given\npremises could only form part of one LMU.  \n13Chapter 4\nCommon land\n4.10 Each common with livestock grazing rights is effectively a shared resource between a\nclosed number of businesses. At times of the year animals may well wander freely around\nthe common, mixing with animals form the other businesses that have grazing rights. In\nsome circumstances, notably when the commoner has land adjacent to the common,\nanimals from all the businesses involved may wander to and from that in-bye land as well.\nThe common, and the in-bye land of all of the businesses grazing that common, could\neffectively be regarded as a single epidemiological unit. There are large common land\nareas which can be effectively split into separate epidemiological units because of natural\nboundaries in the landscape. \n4.11 But equally it is important that those exercising rights of common pay proper attention to\nbiosecurity, and the need to protect their own business and those of others from the\npotential spread of disease.  \nRecommendation 7\nI recommend that an LMU or LMUs be created, at the request of the commoners or a commons\ncouncil, that would encompass the common or parts of the common and the in-bye land of\nthose grazing it. If any commoner declines to include his/her in-bye land within the LMU then all\nmovements between that in-bye and the common must be reported, must respect any standstill\non the premises of departure (including the common), and would impose a standstill on the\npremises of destination, except where an approved isolation facility is used (see paragraph 4.13\nbelow). Where a commons council or equivalent body with statutory powers, has been\nestablished they take on responsibility for regulating the movement of stock to and from the\ncommon concerned. It is noted that there will need to be some flexibility in creating LMUs on\ncommons. The LMUs on common land may have to be broken down into sub-epidemiological\nunits for disease control purposes e.g. in the case of a TB breakdown. \nIsolation Facilities and Standstill\n4.12 With some exceptions most movements of livestock between businesses are subject to\nreporting and standstill.  \n4.13 Some of the existing exemptions provide for the use of an approved isolation facility in\norder to qualify. I believe that greater use could be made of approved isolation facilities\n(isolation facilities can be either biosecure fields or buildings). In this case where one or\nmore animals are brought onto an LMU and held separately from other animals on that\nLMU, the standstill period would apply only to those animals, and not to others on the unit.\nEqually stock could be placed in isolation six or 20 days (if pigs) before their intended sale\n(if, for example, it were known that stock was to be brought onto the farm in the\nintervening period) and could then leave even though the farm was under standstill. To\nqualify the animals would have to be placed in an approved isolation facility for the entire\nduration of the standstill period applicable to them. If other animals were to be introduced\nto the facility during this period, all the animals in the facility must remain until the\nstandstill period applicable to the animals last introduced into the facility has expired. The\ncurrent rules for the construction and operation of isolation facilities are set out in Annex D.\n14Chapter 4\nRecommendation 8\nI recommend the use of approved isolation facilities within LMUs. A movement onto the\nisolation facility will put that facility under a standstill rather than impose a standstill on the\nwhole LMU. Movements into/out of the approved isolation facilities must be recorded in the on\nfarm record. The use of approved isolation facilities will also allow a review of the current\nexemptions to the standstill rules as set out at Annex C.\n4.14 However, I recognise that young lambs and calves for fostering need to be moved at \nshort notice. Because of their age moving them presents a lower disease risk than with\nother animals. \nRecommendation 9\nI recommend that an exemption to the use of isolation facilities and standstill rules be given for\nyoung lambs and calves for fostering. These moves must be recorded and reported.\nMultiple pick-up and drop-off\n4.15 A vehicle picking up stock at more than one premises, for onward transmission to another,\nrisks spreading disease from animals already on the vehicle to the places at which it stops.\nTo control this risk Defra introduced rules that require the construction of a separate\ninstallation at the perimeter of a premises before multiple pick-ups or drop-offs were\npermitted at that premises. \n4.16 The continued existence of this rule is hindering the effective running of a number of\nlivestock and haulage businesses. In particular, data protection legislation is preventing\nDefra from publishing a list of which premises have an approved multiple pick-up and\ndrop-off facility. This causes particular difficulty for hauliers, who may inadvertently commit\nan offence by picking up at non-approved premises. \n4.17 Where transport companies can provide biosecure stock handling facilities it should be\npossible for these to be used as part of the chain in the movement of livestock.\nRecommendation 10\nI recommend that:\na. in the absence of disease or a heightened disease state of alert the need for approval of\nmultiple pick-ups and drop-offs should be suspended;\nb. a journey can only be for (i) multiple drop offs or (ii) multiple pick ups except dropping off to\nabattoirs;\nc. hauliers should keep records of journeys e.g. physical information from an invoice or an ATC.\n15Chapter 4\nReporting Movements\n4.18 Livestock movements are reported as follows:\n• sheep, goats, pigs and deer moves are reported using a movement document (forms\nAML 1, 2 or 24). The completed document is sent to the appropriate Local Authority\n(LA) within three days of the movement;\n• cattle movements are reported to BCMS within three days of the movement.\n4.19 The AML movement documents listed in 4.18 require the keeper at both departure and\ndestination premises to complete the appropriate parts before it is sent to the LA. Defra\nand LAs therefore have information on where sheep, goats, pigs and deer have moved\nbetween thus allowing traceability of the animals. \nRecommendation 11\nI recommend that all AML forms be available electronically. Consideration should be given to\nallow information to be sent electronically to AMLS.\n4.20 However, this is more complex when reporting cattle movements. At present the keeper at\nthe premises of departure reports that the cattle have left that premises, but does not\nreport where they have gone to. The keeper at the premises of destination reports their\nanimals, but not where they have come from. Markets report the movement of cattle\nthrough the market, but neither where they have come from nor where they have gone\nto. This not only results in poor traceability during the time in which these various reports\nare finding their way to the database, it also allows cattle to be moved temporarily to a\nthird premises (such as a dealer’s premises) without CTS ever becoming aware that they\nhave been there. With the possibility that such animals mixed with other animals whilst on\nthe dealer premises there is clearly an enhanced and unacceptable disease risk. \nRecommendation 12\nI recommend that livestock markets, collecting centres and abattoirs be required to play a larger\nroll in movement reporting. Markets and collecting centres should be required to notify CTS not\nonly the premises of departure for cattle arriving in the market or collecting centre but also the\npremises of destination once an animal leaves the market or collecting centre. Abattoirs should\nbe additionally required to report the premises of departure of all cattle received as well as the\nmove to the abattoir.\n4.21 Data submitted electronically can be validated faster and more accurately than data\nsubmitted by other means. It also arrives faster, leading to a significant improvement in\ntraceability.\nRecommendation 13\nI therefore recommend that livestock markets, collecting centres and abattoirs be required to\nsubmit data electronically to CTS and keepers be encouraged to do so.\n16Chapter 4\n4.22 The Animal Health Act 1981 allows local authorities, Defra and WAG three years in which\nto bring a prosecution under the Act. It is important, therefore, that keepers be required\nto retain movement records, including copies of movement documents, for at least this\ntime. At present some documents may be destroyed after six months. \nRecommendation 14\nI recommend that the retention period for movement documents be set at a minimum of \nthree years.\n17Chapter 5\nFindings – Animal Identification\n5.1 The Rules on the identification of livestock are largely set out in EU law, and therefore \ndo not lie at the discretion of Defra, or indeed any other administration in the British Isles.\nI have not therefore examined the appropriateness of these rules.\n5.2 It is clear, however, that problems do exist in the field of animal identification. In particular\near tags sold to farmers are frequently not of sufficient quality to last the life of the animal\nin a readable condition. Some have particularly low retention rates. \nRecommendation 15\nI recommend that the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS), who are responsible for\napproving ear tags for all species, review the current specifications. Having done so, BCMS\nshould take steps to identify those tags that demonstrate poor field performance and revoke\ntheir authorisation.\n5.3 In April 2006 Defra launched a consultation exercise on amendments to the Cattle\nIdentification Regulations. Amongst other measures, Defra have proposed:\n• the abolition of the use of CPP12’s as temporary cattle passports; and\n• to allow the issue of cattle passports to late applicants if the parentage of the calf can\nbe proven by a DNA test.\nRecommendation 16\nI recommend that the Cattle Identification Regulations are amended so that they no longer\nallow the use of CPP12’s as temporary cattle passports and allow the issue of cattle passports to\nlate applicants where the parentage of the calf can be proven e.g. by a DNA test. \n5.4 Cattle sent to abattoirs can be rejected if they only have one tag even though their\nidentity may be secure. I am told that if there is a valid passport plus one ear tag and\nevidence that a second tag having been applied that an OV at the abattoir will not reject\nan animal. I am also told that this is not being consistently applied.\nRecommendation 17\nI recommend that if there is a valid passport plus 1 correct tag and evidence of a second tag\nhaving been applied when an animal arrives at an abattoir that this should be sufficient in\nestablishing the identification of the animal.\n18Chapter 6\nFindings – Collecting Centres\n6.1 Collecting centres serve a number of purposes in the livestock industry. In many respects\nthey are similar to markets, in that animals arrive from a number of different points, mix\ntogether and then leave for one or a number of different points. In this respect the disease\nrisk is also similar to those of markets, in that a diseased animal, if mixed with others at\ncollecting centre risks spreading the disease around a wide number of places. Not all\ncollecting centres activity that currently takes place is legal. The activity of dealers or\ntraders referred to in 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 is tantamount to collecting centre activity,\nalthough not recognised as such in the Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2004 (AGO)\nand Animal Gatherings (Wales) Order 2004 under which collecting centres are licensed.\n6.2 There are approximately four categories of collecting centres:\na. those where relatively small numbers of animals from a number of sources are brought\ntogether in a single place for onward transmission in a larger vehicle to, say, an abattoir.\nThis brings significant economies in the cost of haulage to those using this facility;\nb. is the same except that the animals have to be delivered to one or more abattoirs from\nthe collecting centre. This brings the same economies in the cost of haulage, but\nenables the collecting centre to be used additionally by those whose premises is under\na movement standstill;\nc. the premises of a dealer or trader, where stock acquired at a number of farms (or\nmarkets) is mixed and sorted prior to onward carriage to the premises of the dealer or\ntrader’s customer(s);\nd. Assembly Centres at which animals are gathered prior to export. \nOf these a. b. and d. are licensed by Defra and WAG. \nWith the exception of animals going for export, collecting centres are not required to tag\nanimals passing through them. Neither does the arrival of stock at a collecting centre\ntrigger a movement standstill on those premises.\nThe conditions for the approval of collecting centres can be found at Annex E.\n6.3 I believe that Defra should recognise the role that dealers and traders play in ensuring that\nthose who need to purchase livestock, but who may not be able to afford to spend time\nvisiting farms and markets some way from home, can do so. But at the same time dealers\nand traders need to recognise that they have a responsibility to themselves, their\ncustomers, the livestock industry and the public at large, to ensure that their activities are\ncarried out in a way that minimises disease risk. \n6.4 The disease risk is less if stock are moved direct from farm of origin to farm of destination\nand this should be the preferred option. If livestock have to move through a dealers or\ntraders premises these premises should be licensed as a collecting centre. However, by\nusing one or more approved isolation facilities it should be possible for them to operate\nwithout having to ensure that all stock leave the premises before new stock enters. In this\nspecific circumstance animals would not have to remain in the isolation facility for the full\n19Chapter 6\nstandstill period, but to minimise the spread of disease animals destined for more than\none customer must not be mixed in any one isolation facility. Neither after the departure\nof the animals would the isolation facility have to remain empty for 27 days (if on grass)\nbefore re-use. At times of heightened disease state of alert the 27 day rule should be re-\nintroduced. These provisions could be applied to any premises licensed under AGO.\nRecommendation 18\nI recommend that dealers and traders premises be licensed as collecting centres and include the\nuse of isolation facilities as set out above.\n6.5 There are cases where animals are notified to CTS as having left the premises of departure\non one date, and as having arrived at the premises of destination two or more days later.\nSuch a movement would be incompatible with the rules on animal welfare, and raise\nserious questions about whether the animals might have spent time on a third\n(unreported) premises. This is quite clearly a disease risk, as the full movement history of\nthese animals could not be traced.\nRecommendation 19\nI recommend that BCMS should identify all cases where cattle are reported as arriving at their\npremises of destination two or more days after leaving the premises of departure. These cases\nshould be investigated.\nMovement to abattoirs\n6.6 For some years prior to the FMD outbreak in 2001 animals arriving at an abattoir were\nrequired to be slaughtered within 72 hours of arrival. During the FMD outbreak this period\nwas reduced to 24 hours, to reduce the risk of disease spreading from animals in the\nabattoir lairage. In 2002 the time limit was raised to 48 hours.\n6.7 For most purposes this time limit is sufficient, but abattoirs operating on a Monday have\nfound it particularly difficult to manage the flow of stock, notable because such stock is\nusually purchased at market the previous Friday. The Animal Gatherings (England) Order\n2004 allows stock to remain at a market no longer than 48 hours after the arrival of the\nfirst animal. Allowing time for deliveries to be completed, and sale, animals generally have\nto leave the market within 24 hours or so of being sold. If they move to an abattoir,\nabattoir operators found that this gave them little flexibility and constrained their\noperations. \n6.8 The problem set out in 6.7 above has now been resolved. Council Regulation 853/2004\nentered into force on January 2006. This states simply that animals arriving at an abattoir\nshall be slaughtered “without undue delay”, replacing the previous fixed time limit.\nEffectively each case now has to be considered on its merits, which has led to problems of\ninconsistency in interpretation by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS).\n20Chapter 6\nRecommendation 20\nI recommend that the 48 hour limit for stock to remain on a market be extended (at the\ndiscretion of the DVM in each case). However, no other stock may enter the market premises\nuntil all stock from a previous gathering have been removed, and the market has been cleansed\nand disinfected in accordance with AGO.\n6.9 I have been given evidence that a number of unlicensed collecting centres operate to take\nstock from a market late in the week for delivery to an abattoir early the following week.\nBecause they are operating illegally, the quality of biosecurity at such gatherings is an\nunknown quantity, but it would be reasonable to assume that the disease risk is higher\nthan is acceptable.\n6.10 It should be possible to bring such gatherings with the law, so that biosecurity standards\ncan be properly policed. This could be achieved by permitting movements to take place\nfrom a market to a collecting centre (these being currently prohibited). The existing rules\napplicable to the licensing of collecting centres should be applied. This provision should\nnot apply at times of heightened disease state of alert.\nRecommendation 21\nI recommend that the existing movement licences be amended to permit stock to move from a\nlivestock market to a collecting centre. \n21Annex A\nQuestionnaire\n1. How do the rules on livestock identification and movements affect your business?\n2. Have you made any changes to the way you operate in order to be able to reduce the\nimpact of these rules? If so, what are they?\n3. What was your experience of the enforcement of these rules? Have you found this\nburdensome?  Has there been little noticeable enforcement? Or has the level of enforcement\nbeen about right to deter those wishing to circumvent the rules from doing do?\n4. Is there still a need for linking premises such as Sole Occupancy Authorities or linked\nholdings for cattle?\n5. Should there be a distance limit for linking premises such as Sole Occupancy Authorities?\n6. Should there be a distance limit for reporting all livestock movements along the lines of the\n5 mile rule for sheep and goats?\n7. The movement documents (AML forms) were designed in conjunction with the sheep and\npig industries. Are there any improvements you would wish to suggest?\n8. Is it burdensome to have different movement rules in Scotland from those in England and\nWales? If so, please explain what the impact is?\n9. Defra allocates premises identifiers in the form of County/Parish/Holding numbers. Has the\nway these are allocated enable your business to adopt to the livestock movement rules?\nIf so, how? If not, why not?\n10. Could Defra/RPA/SVS/local authority inspection activity be better targeted? If so, how?\n11. Could enforcement activity be better targeted? If so, how?\n12. Given that livestock identification and movement rules are in place to enable animal\ndisease to be controlled, do you have any suggestions as to how this objective might be\nachieved in any other way?\n22Annex B\nThe Cattle Tracing System – Linked Holdings  \nIssue\nB.1 This paper provides a brief outline of the current rules for linking holdings and their purpose.\nBackground\nB.2 Holdings are identified on the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database by CPH number.\nMovements of cattle between holdings must normally be reported to the British Cattle\nMovement Service (BCMS). However, movements of cattle between certain “CTS linked\nholdings” do not need to be reported.  \nB.3 Centralised Cattle movement reporting procedures were introduced in 1998 and CTS linked\nholdings were introduced at this point to mitigate the reporting burden on some keepers.\nReporting every movement – even daily movements between grazing and milking parlours\n– was considered to be an onerous and unreasonable burden on industry. For some\nkeepers, strict application of EU movement reporting requirements would have meant\nreporting hundreds of movements backwards and forwards between holdings every day. \nB.4 Cattle keepers (except markets and abattoirs) may apply to BCMS to have CPH numbers\nlinked on CTS for the purpose of exempting them from reporting the movements of cattle\nbetween linked CPHs. The procedure does not alter the requirements for birth, import and\ndeath reporting from each holding. It means that on inspection the presence of cattle on\nany linked holding rather than the main holding is not considered a non-compliance and\ndoes not attract subsidy penalty or movement restrictions. Farmers must, though, record\nthe movements between linked holdings in their herd farm records (except for movements\ndaily between shared milking parlours).  \nCurrent Rules\nB.5 A keeper must nominate a main holding for administrative purposes. All other holdings \nto be linked are flagged as ‘closed’ on CTS. CTS then shows which holdings are linked.\nOnce the link is established the keeper can use the main holding’s CPH for other birth,\nmovement and death reporting purposes. \nB.6 There are two types of link that a keeper can have on CTS, they are:  \n• Shared Facility Links (SF’s): used when a keeper does not want to report movements\nbetween several holdings he/she owns or between holdings which share facilities. The\narrangement must be “permanent” (longer than 364 days) and the movements\nfrequent. Such holdings have to be within 25 miles of each other. \nAll holdings involved are registered to the same keeper (i.e. registered to the same\ntrading name or business). The procedure sees the keeper nominating a main CPH\nnumber. All other CPH’s (secondary holdings) will then be closed and linked to the\nmain CPH. Administratively all animals are moved off all secondary holdings onto the\n23Annex B\nmain CPH number, with an agreed movement date. The keeper is required to update\nthe movement summary pages for the animals in the cattle passports. Once the SF link\nis in place movements between the holdings do not need to be reported to BCMS. \n• Additional Land Links (AL’s): This link is used when a keeper wants to use another\nholding for summer grazing and winter housing. This link cannot be used if the\nholdings are owned by the same business. There are no mileage restrictions for this\ntype of link. This link cannot be open for longer than 364 days. \nOnce an AL link has been entered, movements to and from the land do not need to \nbe reported. All births will be reported to the keeper’s own holding number. However,\nthe keeper is still obliged by law to keep his own farm records up-to date. The LH rules\nfor AL require the keeper to specify the start and end dates for the letting period.\nDuring this period cattle can move any distance between seasonal lets without being\nreported. Once the end date has elapsed CTS removes the link and the keeper has to\nre-apply again.\nNB There are no set limits on how many links a keeper can have at any given time.\nAlso it is not uncommon for a keeper to have both a SF and an AL.  \nProblems associated with Linked Holdings (LH)\nStandstill\nB.7 Once the LH has been agreed movements between premises within the link needn’t be\nreported to BCMS. This causes difficulties for the monitoring of livestock movement\nstandstills generated by the movement of cattle – because as the system does not receive\nnotification of these moves it cannot impose a standstill.  This may well mean that cattle\n(and other species) may move off a linked holding in defiance of a standstill.    \nLegislative Issues \nB.8 EU Regulation 1760/2000 and the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 (as amended)\nstate that all cattle movements should be notified. There has never been a formal\nderogation for the use of ‘linked holdings’, which allows cattle movements to go\nunreported. The current practice of ‘linked holdings’ therefore under implements EU\nLegislation. \nDisease Control \nB.9 The existence of LH arguably increases the risk of disease spreading (because of the\nconcomitant failure to impose standstill) and increase the difficulty of tracing any cattle\nbecause movements over long distances are unreported to the central database. As it\nstands the database can only tell us which linked CPH’s the animals could be on; only\ndirect enquiry of the keeper and looking at his records will tell us exactly where they are.\nEvery LH potentially increases the number of premises, which must be assumed as being\ncontiguous to an infected premise, and thus LHs could increase the costs associated with\ncontaining a major disease outbreak.  \n24Annex B\nInspections and Enforcement\nB.10 The RPA and veterinary inspectors need to inspect all cattle at the location at any given\ntime. The current practice of creating a main holding and ‘closing’ satellite holdings on\nCTS does not allow the RPA inspectorate to get a clear understanding of where the cattle\nare located. Time is therefore wasted prior to the inspection by inspectors contacting the\nfarmer to see if the cattle are located where the system thinks they should be.  \nConfusion between a LH and a SOA \nB.11 People confuse LHs and Sole Occupancy Authorities (SOAs). A SOA (issued by the SVS)\npermits livestock keepers to move sheep, goats, pigs and cattle within a group of holdings\nforming an agreed epidemiological unit without respecting any movement standstill\nimposed on that group. A SOA is granted to join premises for movement licence purposes\nonly. A SOA does not always correspond with links set up on CTS. If a keeper wishes to\nmove cattle between premises without informing BCMS of the movements they must also\nhave set up a CTS link. Confusion has been caused with keepers who mistakenly believe\nthat if they have a SOA agreement, they no longer have to report cattle movements to\nBCMS. This is incorrect. If cattle are moved from one holding to another and the 2\nholdings are not CTS linked, the movement must be reported to BCMS. All movements\nbetween holdings in a SOA have to be recorded in the farm records as do all movements\nof cattle between linked holdings.\n25Annex C\nLivestock Movements Regime – the Existing Provisions\nThe Background\nC.1 Before the outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease (February 2001), there were relatively few\nrestrictions on the movements of livestock. This disease outbreak showed that more\nneeded to be done to prevent the outbreak of disease and to reduce its impact when an\noutbreak occurs.\nC.2 Livestock movement controls were put in place immediately after the 2001 outbreak. A 20\nday standstill was imposed on all livestock, on the basis of scientific and veterinary advice\nthat it both slowed down the spread of any disease present and improved the chances of\ndetecting disease within a flock or herd before animals moved. \nC.3 The Government commissioned two independent inquiries into the 2001 FMD outbreak, a\nLessons Learned Inquiry chaired by Dr Iain Anderson and a scientific review by the Royal\nSociety chaired by Sir Brian Follett. Both inquiries endorsed the retention of the 20 day\nstandstill on disease control grounds until the Government had carried out a detailed risk\nassessment and wide-ranging cost-benefit analysis of the impact of different standstill\nperiods.\nThe Current Regime\nC.4 On 1 August 2003 as a result of the findings from a risk assessment and cost-benefit\nanalysis of standstill regimes, the Standing Movement Arrangements for England and\nWales came into force. Under the regime, whenever cattle and sheep are brought onto a\nholding, no cattle or sheep may move off that holding for 6 days afterwards, unless the\nmovement is one of those listed as an exemption (see the list of exemptions below).\nSole Occupancy Authorities\nC.5 A group of premises within the same management and control may be granted a Sole\nOccupancy Authority (SOA). When sheep, goat, pigs and cattle are brought onto any one\nof the premises within the SOA a standstill is imposed on all of them. However, they may\nmove between premises in the SOA without observing the standstill. These movements\nmust be recorded and reported. Cattle moves within a SOA do need to be reported unless\nthere is also a CTS link.\nC.6 Applications for a SOA must be made to the Divisional Veterinary Manager (DVM), who\nmust be satisfied that the premises within the SOA are truly linked in terms of\nmanagement and control. This will be confirmed by a Local Veterinary Inspector (LVI) who\nwill visit the premises. There are no distance limits on the premises which make up a SOA.\n26Annex C\nEligible group of premises. \nC.7 a. Premises owned or rented by an individual, partnership or company on which all cattle,\nsheep, goats, pigs, deer or camelids are under the same sole control and management.\nThis includes individual fields or buildings, so long as they have separate access points \nand are securely stock-proofed, or \nb. several geographically separate plots of land controlled and managed by a farmer, or\nc. a family farm where several family members each have their own land separately\nregistered but who work in partnership sharing manpower and equipment and make\ncommon management decisions, or\nd. a small farming partnership where the applicant can demonstrate management and\ncontrol of all the farming units. \nC.8 All premises included on the application for a SOA must be epidemiologically linked (this\nmeans that there must be common management, shared staff, equipment, procedures)\nand managed together.\nC.9 A group of unrelated farmers cannot band together to obtain a SOA even if there had\nbeen occasional sharing of equipment or manpower in the past. In exceptional\ncircumstances joint applications may be considered from no more than two applicants if\nland or facilities are shared as a part of routine and regular management practice and\nalternative arrangements cannot be made.\nMovements permitted under a SOA\nC.10 a. Movement of FMD susceptible livestock for husbandry and management reasons. For \ninstance to move dry dairy cows to grazing or returning cows for parturition; sheep \nmoving between grazings or to lambing sheds and ram and billy goat movements or \npigs between associated sites,\nb. Movement of FMD susceptible livestock between and within grazings, premises or\ngroups of premises owned or rented, which are in the same sole occupancy,\nmanagement and control.\nSOA conditions\nC.11 a. no premises can be included in more than one SOA\nb. common or shared grazing cannot be included in a SOA\nc. all movements of animals under a SOA must be in accordance with the conditions of\nthe appropriate General Licence to move cattle or sheep.\nd. During all movements, animals must not come into contact with other animals that are\nnot under the same sole control. Movement across land, including fields, where the\nowner of the SOA does not have sole control over all such animals is not permitted.\ne. In order to add or delete premise(s) to a SOA, a new application form with the details\nof the applicant, the previous SOA number and the details of the additional/deleted\npremise(s) must be completed.  \n27Annex C\n5 mile rule for sheep and goats and SOAs \nC.12 The five mile boundary is measured as the crow flies, from the nearest points on the\nborders of the main site and the outlying land. That is, the distance from the outside\nedges. Land wholly or partially within the five mile radius may be classed as part of the\nholding. It is the keeper’s responsibility to determine whether outlying land falls within the\n5 mile boundary or not. \nFigure 3 below is an illustrative picture of how the 5 mile rules is calculated\nSOAs that include parcels of land within 5 miles are no longer valid as they are seen to be part of\nyour main holding. However, those that include land outside the five-mile boundary remain valid\nand keepers will have to record movements between those holdings.\nOther exemptions to the Standstill\nC.13 From 1 August to 30 November every year, breeding rams and bulls will: \na. be allowed to leave premises that are under a six day standstill for a market, provided\nthey have been placed in a Defra approved isolation facility for six days beforehand.\nThe sender of the animals being moved must certify (by way of a declaration on the\nmovement licence) that the animals have been confined in a Defra approved isolation\nfacility for 6 days. The declaration must be sent to the Local Authority, who will note its\narrival on AMLS; \n28Annex C\nb. not trigger a six day standstill on their home premises if they are returning unsold from\na market, provided that they are placed in a Defra approved isolation facility for six\ndays. The recipient of the animals being moved must certify (by way of a declaration\non the movement licence) that the animals intended for breeding purposes have been\nconfined in a Defra approved isolation facility for 6 days;\nc. not trigger a six day standstill on the premises for breeding that they are being bought\nonto, (e.g. moving from a farm, or from a market they have been bought from and\nonto a farm) provided they are isolated for six days in a Defra approved isolation\nfacility. In the case of breeding rams, ewes placed in isolation with those rams will\nthemselves have to spend six days in isolation. The recipient of the animals must certify\n(by way of a declaration on the movement licence) that the animals have been received\nand will be confined in a Defra approved isolation facility for 6 days\nMoves to markets, collecting centres, shows, breed inspections\nC.14 The movement of an animal onto premises licensed under the Animal Gatherings\n(England) Order 2004 and Animal Gatherings (Wales) Order 2004 for a sale, show or\nexhibition, for onward consignment within Great Britain for further rearing, finishing or\nslaughter or for an inspection to confirm specific breed characteristics will not trigger a\nstandstill on that premises.\nImported animals and animals destined for export\nC.15 Imported livestock will not trigger a standstill at the first premises they are kept at (after\nthe port or airport of entry itself, to which no standstill will apply either). Livestock for\nexport will have to comply with EU residence time requirements, but (except for sheep and\ngoats to be exported for breeding or fattening) need not respect a standstill on the\npremises of departure.\nMovements to slaughter\nC.16 Cattle or sheep may move off premises direct to an abattoir, slaughter collecting centre,\ndedicated slaughter collection or dedicated slaughter market irrespective of whether\nlivestock have moved onto those premises in the previous 6 days. From a dedicated\nslaughter market or dedicated slaughter collection, no animal may return to its premises of\norigin or move to any premises other than an abattoir.\nMovements for veterinary treatment\nC.17 Cattle and sheep may move to premises for veterinary treatment irrespective of whether\nlivestock have moved onto the premises of origin in the previous 6 days. Once at the\nveterinary treatment centre the animals must be held in complete physical isolation from\nall other animals present at the premises. \n29Annex C\nC.18 The premises where veterinary treatment is carried out are not subject to standstill\nrequirements and cattle and sheep (including offspring born at the veterinary premises),\nmay return to the premises of origin without triggering a standstill on their return there,\nprovided they have been isolated from other animals whilst undergoing veterinary\ntreatment.  \nMovements to/from an Artificial Insemination Centre\nC.19 Sheep and goats, moving to an Artificial Insemination (AI) Centre can do so irrespective of\nwhether livestock have moved onto the premises of departure in the previous 6 days\nprovided they have been in a Defra approved isolation facility for 6 days prior to departure\nonto an AI Centre. Cattle moving to an artificial insemination centre can do so irrespective\nof whether livestock have moved onto the premises of departure in the previous 6 days. \nC.20 The premises where artificial insemination is carried out are not subject to standstill\nrequirements. Cattle can return to their original premises of departure without triggering a\nstandstill on those premises. If sheep and goats have been isolated from all other animals\nwhile at the AI Centre they can return to their original premises of departure without\ntriggering a standstill provided they are placed in a Defra approved isolation facility on\ntheir return, otherwise they will trigger a standstill. The recipient of the sheep must declare\nthat the animals were isolated from all other animals while at the AI centre and that they\nhave been placed in an isolation facility on return. \nMovements to a laboratory for diagnostic tests \nC.21 Cattle or sheep being moved to a laboratory for diagnostic tests to be carried out to\nascertain whether the animal is affected by, or has been exposed to, disease need not\nrespect any standstill on the premises of departure, and will not trigger a standstill on\narrival at the laboratory. Once at the laboratory the animals must be held in complete\nphysical isolation from all other animals present at the premises. \n30Annex D\nConditions for Approving On – Farm Isolation\nFacilities – Current Rules\nConstruction for Standards\nD.1 Buildings used for the on-farm isolation facilities must be dedicated for the on-farm\nisolation and be physically separate from any buildings used for other livestock. \na. Pastures used for on-farm isolation facilities must be dedicated for on-farm isolation\nand be physically separate from any pastures or buildings used for other livestock on\nthe premises. A minimum distance of 3 metres is required between the perimeter of\nthe isolation fields and any other livestock. This 3 metre separation would be satisfied\nwith stockproof double fencing.\nb. Animals should only be moved between isolation facilities on the same farm with\nveterinary or official permission.\nD.2 a. Any buildings used in the isolation facility must be designed such that any discharges, \neffluent and manure are retained there or disposed of in such a manner that they do \nnot come into contact with other livestock.\nb. A dedicated loading/off loading facility must be provided for each isolation facility.\nThis facility shall be fully cleansed and disinfected after each use.\nD.3 Operating procedures\na. Dedicated protective clothing for staff must be provided for the isolation facility. \nb. Protective clothing to be provided for visitors.\nc. Disinfectants footbaths to be provided and used at the entrance(s) to the isolation\nfacilities.\nd. Any person entering the isolation facility must wear protective clothing and footwear\nand use the disinfectant footbaths at the entrance(s).\ne. Any unused feeding stuffs, fodder, bedding etc. intended for animals in the isolation\nfacility must remain in the isolation facility while there are animals present.\nf. All equipment, pens, hurdles, etc, in the isolation facility must remain there until the 6\nor 20 day standstill period, as appropriate, has been satisfactorily completed.\ng. Special rules apply to any lactating animals that are in these isolation facilities. The\nwelfare of these animals must be safeguarded and it may be necessary to take these\nanimals to a milking parlour on the farm if other means of milking them cannot be\nfound. The following conditions apply in these circumstances:\n• The animals in isolation must be brought to the parlour after any other resident\nstock have been milked and have been returned to their accommodation or fields.\nA minimum of 3 metres separation must be maintained between the resident\nanimals and the animals in isolation. \n31Annex D\n• The animals in isolation must be put through the parlour after all other resident\nmilking stock.\n• Any farm yards, the parlour collecting area, the parlour itself and the milking\nequipment e.g. clusters must be thoroughly washed down after the animals in\nisolation have passed through. A ‘full standard wash cycle’ as required under the\ndairy Hygiene Regulations must be applied to the milking equipment in the parlour\nafter the isolation animals have been through and before it is used again for the\nresident lactating animals.\n• The animals in isolation must be returned to their own accommodation immediately\nafter they have been milked.\nh. After an isolation facility has been emptied of stock it must be thoroughly cleansed and\ndisinfected before any new stock is placed in the facility.\nD.4 Recording\nA record must be kept in the farm movement records of the date each animal (identified\nindividually) entered an isolation facility, and the date it leaves. \n32Annex E\nCollecting Centres\nE.1 A Collecting Centre is where there is a collection of animals for onward consignment\nwithin GB. These are governed by the Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2004 and the\nAnimal Gatherings (Wales) Order 2004. \nE.2 Once a premises has been approved by the State Veterinary Service a licence will be\nissued. The type of licence issued will be dependent on whether the premises can be\ncleansed and disinfected\nE.3 The following sets out the conditions. \nPlease note that the conditions highlighted in bold do not apply to collecting\ncentres that are non cleansable and those that are in italics only apply to non\ncleansable premises.\nE.4 General Conditions: \na) The licensee must ensure that the current contingency plan agreed between the\nDivisional Veterinary Manager and the licensee for dealing with a suspect/confirmed\ncase of notifiable disease is complied with.\nb) The licensee shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any person attending the\nlicensed premises complies with the terms of this licence.\nc) The licensee shall appoint a biosecurity officer to monitor compliance with this licence\nand with the Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2004 and the Animal Gatherings\n(Wales) Order 2004\nd) The licensee shall take all reasonable steps to prevent the spread of disease on to, in\nand off the premises during the animal gathering\ne) No person shall allow an animal gathering to take place on premises on which animals\nhave been kept until 27 days have passed from the day on which – \n(a) the last animal left those premises; and\n(b) after the last animal has left the premises, all equipment to which animals have had\naccess has been cleansed of visible contamination.\nE.5 Facilities at Licensed Premises: \nThe licence holder must ensure that:\na) animal pens can be properly secured;\nb) animals cannot escape from the licensed premises onto adjacent land and no direct\ncontact is possible with animals on adjacent land;\nc) the floor of the animal area and all fixtures and fittings in the animal area are\nin a good state of repair such that they remain capable of being cleansed and\ndisinfected in accordance with The Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2004\nand the Animal Gatherings (Wales) Order 2004; \n33Annex E\nd) there is a discrete area for the cleansing and disinfection of vehicles\ntransporting animals which is itself capable of being cleansed and disinfected; \ne) there is a discrete area for the cleansing and disinfection of vehicles transporting\nanimals identified within the licensed premises which:\ni) is identified on the site plan;\nii) is itself capable of being cleansed and disinfected;

Law \nReview Committee (TLRC), which has been considering the issue of tax equity as \nbetween the employed and self-employed. The paper should not be taken to represent \nthe views of the TLRC. \n2 The  Introduction to this paper sets out the background to the TLRC project \nand the parameters of this paper. The questions addressed by the TLRC project relate \nto two main areas: \n• Classification. What problems, if any, are caused by the current classification of \nworkers into employees and the self-employed for tax purposes and how sensible is \nthat classification in modern economic conditions? Could a better system of \nclassification be devised for this purpose? \n• Alignment. How far could and should the tax and National Insurance \ncontributions (NICs) position of these two groups be aligned?  \n3 This paper looks primarily at the issue of classification. This is not because the \nquestion of alignment is any less important. Clearly, if tax and National Insurance \ndifferences between the groups of workers could be removed, classification would \nbecome less important. The issues need to be examined in stages, however, since \nalignment may not be necessary or desirable if there are real differences between the \ntwo groups of workers.  \n4 The question of alignment of treatment raises fundamental questions about the \nway tax is collected in the UK and the true role of the National Insurance system. \nRadical reform, such as integration of tax and NICs or changes to the PAYE system, \nmight be the only way to eliminate completely the problems of equity as between the \nemployed and self-employed. Other issues of importance are methods of tax collection \nand differences in rules on computation. These issues are all alluded to but not \naddressed in detail here. \n5 This paper should not be taken as a comment one way or the other on the \ndesirability of these reforms, but it is important that all these issues continue to be \ndiscussed and researched. Whilst this wider work continues, however, the TLRC feels \nthat publication of this discussion paper purely on classification issues is timely and \nhelpful in the light of recent tax and employment law developments. \n6 Chapter 1 describes some of the problems encountered in trying to classify \nworkers. Workers cover a broad spectrum. At each end of this spectrum, the features \nof the employed and self-employed can be clearly distinguished. The unequivocally \nself-employed person will be running a business on his own account, bearing the risk \n vof loss, investing capital and independent of his clients. It would be impractical, if not \nimpossible, to deduct tax at source from his gross income.  \n7 An unequivocally employed person will receive a wage or salary. He is more \nlikely to be subject to some kind of direct supervision and will be integrated into the \nbusiness to which he is supplying his services. It will be practical and convenient to \nrequire the employer to deduct tax at source from such an employee, and a cumulative \nPAYE system will work well.  \n8 There are workers who do not fit either of these two descriptions precisely, but \nlie somewhere between the two ends of this spectrum. They may be described as \noccupying a ‘grey area’ at the borderline of the classification divide. Such workers \nmay find themselves classified differently for different legal purposes. \n9 Some differences in rules may operate unfairly even as between workers \nclearly and properly classified on one side or other of the divide. For example, some \nunequivocal employees will incur genuine expenses that they cannot deduct for tax \npurposes under current rules. It is in relation to the group in the grey area, however, \nthat the question of inequity between the employed and self-employed is most likely \nto be raised. Chapter 1 illustrates the difficulty of comparing workers playing different \neconomic roles and fitting them into legal classifications where those classifications \nresult in different tax and other consequences. \n10 Removing the differences in tax and NICs treatments between different groups \ncould reduce these classification problems. The examples discussed in Chapter 1, \nhowever, show that there are real differences at each end of the worker status \nspectrum. It would be very difficult, and not always practical or helpful, to remove all \ndifferences in treatment, though reduction of the differences might be possible. This \npaper, however, concentrates on classification. \n11 While it is inevitable that the focus is on the ‘hard cases’, it must be \nremembered that the vast majority of the working population will fall clearly within \nthe category either of employed or of self-employed. Any proposals for reform of \nclassification issues must bear this in mind and must not unsettle the position of the \nmany for the sake of the few, for example by creating multiple classifications that \nwould engender more, not less, uncertainty. \n12 Chapter 2 examines the evidence on changing work patterns and considers \nthe implications of this for the legal rules on classification. Working patterns have \nchanged significantly over the past 20 years. There are now more non-standard \nworkers than previously: self-employed, part-timers and short-fixed-term workers. \nNot all these workers present problems for the tax system but some are at the \nborderline of the employed/self-employed classification. This classification was \ndeveloped when employment patterns were generally more stable and straightforward.  \n13 The increase in all types of non-standard work poses challenges to the legal \nsystem of classification. Most people are still in standard work and this may well \n vi \ncontinue to be the case, but increasing numbers are wholly or partly engaged in \nvariations of this standard pattern. In addition, a high proportion of businesses in the \nUK are sole traders or partnerships without employees. Many of these will be ‘grey \narea’ workers. \n14 In a tax context, this has two main consequences. First, the number of workers \nat the borderline of the employed and self-employed classification has increased. This \nputs pressure on the borderline that is drawn in the case law. It increases the problems \nwhere very different tax consequences flow from classification. It places a heavy \nweight on this case law classification and on the courts to make it coherent and as far \nas possible in tune with reality, whilst maintaining a degree of certainty. The high \nproportion of self-employment without employees in the business population creates \ndifficulties for a government that wishes to target ‘entrepreneurs’ or ‘genuine \nbusinesses’ for reliefs and allowances, but to exclude those it perceives to be \n‘disguised wage-labourers’. The difficulty of drawing such a line is discussed in \nChapter 2 and throughout the paper. \n15 Second, even where classification is not an issue because a non-standard \nworker is fairly clearly on one side of the line or the other, the rules developed for \nstandard workers may not fit easily with the increasing number of those who do not \nfollow the standard pattern. Cumulative PAYE, the expenses rules and NICs record \nrules are all examples of this problem.  \n16 Chapter 3 considers the UK case law on employment status in detail. The \napproach of some other jurisdictions is also considered briefly. Unlike sociological or \neconomic analysis, which may accommodate the notion of hybrid workers more \neasily, legal classification of workers must place them on one side or the other of the \nemployed/self-employed boundary. This places great strain on decision-making where \ncomplex factual situations are concerned. The chapter analyses the case law on worker \nstatus in the areas of income tax, NICs and VAT. A comparison is made between the \napproach of the courts in tax and in employment law cases.  \n17 In the UK, great weight is placed by the courts on the facts of each case and \nthere is no definitive list of factors or weighting of those factors to be taken into \naccount. If workers are seen as stretching across a continuous spectrum, then this fact-\nbased jurisprudence accords with reality and gives the courts the best chance of \nadapting the law to changing work patterns. It also prevents the definition of an \nemployee or self-employed person from becoming formulaic, which could result in \nmanipulation. At the same time, the law needs to provide guidance and certainty. Any \nunwillingness of the courts to formulate status decisions as questions of law may \nmake certainty more difficult to achieve and may place a burden on the Inland \nRevenue, business and workers alike.  \n18 At first sight, the case law tests for determining the status of workers might \nseem to be outdated and too uncertain to be of real value. It has been suggested that a \nsimpler, clearer test is needed but no one has been able to suggest such a test. The \nvariety of working patterns that exists makes it impossible to devise a simple test. \n viiObjective tests such as the number of clients/employers for whom work is done would \nbe easily manipulated if they were stated categorically and rigidly. As commented by \nthe Tax Law Rewrite Team, any statutory test would need to list factors or badges to \nbe considered in much the same way as the case law does. It is questionable whether \nanything would be achieved by any such statutory listing.  \n19 It is significant that no simple statutory test seems to have been devised in the \nother jurisdictions examined. Many common law countries have a list of factors \nsimilar to those in the UK. Where countries do use statutory definitions of employees \nor ‘disguised employees’, they often utilise concepts such as dependence, \nentrepreneurship or running a business, which raise as many issues as does the use of \nthe concept of a contract of service. Nevertheless, statutory clarification of definitions \nfor some groups of workers, or legislative ‘safe harbours’ for particular groups, as \nused in some jurisdictions, can be helpful in shifting the burden of proof and \nproviding a practical level of certainty. Inland Revenue guidance is also discussed. \n20 The value of the case law should not be underestimated. The courts have \nshown an ability to adapt to changing working conditions in cases such as Hall v \nLorimer and to lay down some guidelines. There is, however, considerable uncertainty \nat the margins about worker classification under the case law. It can be confusing also \nthat, whilst the employment law, insurance, tort, income tax, VAT and National \nInsurance cases all appear to start at the same point and cite the same authorities, the \ndifferent contexts in which they are heard seem to result in the development of subtly \ndiverging case law. The assumptions and policy objectives of the different courts, \nwhether they are express as in some cases or merely implicit, do appear to affect their \ndecisions. \n21 The case law tests have been given a central role under the personal service \nintermediaries legislation. The controversial nature of this legislation and the fact that \nlitigation has been threatened do suggest that a great burden will be placed on these \ntests. If the legislation is to be accepted, it will be necessary for the courts to meet this \nchallenge by showing the flexibility to take full account of the types of arrangement \nbeing entered into using intermediaries, whilst giving concrete enough guidance to \nprovide the commercial certainty needed by these arrangements and the new \nlegislation. Some further statutory or extra-statutory guidance may also be needed, as \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 below. \n22 Chapter 4 considers the legislative response to particular types of worker for \nwhom categorisation under existing case law is especially problematic. Workers in \nthese ‘problem’ categories have grown in number over the last two decades and this \ndevelopment may continue. Examples are homeworkers, casual workers, agency \nworkers and others supplying services through an intermediary, construction workers \nand entertainment workers.  \n23 There are various legislative approaches to dealing with cases where \nclassification as employed or self-employed is difficult: \n viii \na) the workers may be treated as if they were employees for some or all purposes, \nregardless of their status under the case law (for example, agency workers); the new \npersonal service intermediaries legislation is a variant of this approach, discussed in \nChapter 4;  \nb) a group of workers may have a special procedure, such as deduction at source, or \nother set of rules, applied to them so that the question of employment status becomes \nless significant (for example, construction workers); \nc) a third approach, found in some modern employment legislation, is to bypass the \nconcept of employee altogether and to extend provisions to ‘workers’, defined to \ncover all or some of those in the ‘grey area’. \n24 All these techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages. New \nboundaries and definitions can be created, which bring their own definitional \ndifficulties. Classification problems are not completely avoided, but they may be \neased. Further specific legislation and subcategories are suggested by some as a \nsolution to the problems of uncertainty and inadequacy perceived to result from our \ncurrent case law classification. The existing special provisions examined in Chapter 4 \nprovide some guidance to the effectiveness of these methods.  \n25 Chapter 5 examines decision-making mechanisms for classification of \nworkers for tax, National Insurance and employment law purposes. Considerable \nimprovements have been made recently, with the merger of the Contributions Agency \nand the Inland Revenue. Both at an administrative level and within the court system, \ntax and National Insurance status decisions should be taken using a common \napproach, except where there are statutory differences. \n26 There will continue to be differences between the approaches for tax and NICs \npurposes on the one hand and employment law on the other. Different courts again \nmay consider employment status for other purposes, such as tort and contract. It \nwould be impractical to draw all status decisions into one jurisdiction since the issue \narises in so many different contexts. Courts do need to be clear, however, as suggested \nabove, about which principles they are applying. \n27 At an administrative level, for tax and NICs purposes, taxpayers need to be \nable to request binding opinions about status. The reluctance of the Inland Revenue to \nadvise on hypothetical situations is understandable, but workers and their engagers do \nneed to know in advance how workers will be treated for tax purposes in order to cost \ncontracts and agree fees. Timely advice is also necessary. The personal service \nintermediaries legislation seems to have led to a greater willingness on the part of the \nInland Revenue to give binding opinions within a time-limit. The handling of these \nopinions should be monitored. The system for those using intermediaries should be no \nmore favourable than that for individuals supplying services directly. Time-limits \ncould be considered for all status opinions.  \n ix28 Chapter 6 poses some questions for further consideration arising directly from \nthis paper. These relate to: judicial guidance on classification; the use of statutory \nextensions to cover particular groups of workers; ‘safe harbours’ to carve out certain \ngroups of workers; the relationship between tax, National Insurance and employment \nprotection; and the guidance to be given by the Inland Revenue and other government \nbodies on classification of workers. This chapter invites comments from readers. \n29 The chapter goes on to outline some wider issues for future research on areas \nonly touched on by this paper, such as National Insurance, cumulative PAYE, non-\ncumulative deduction at source and universal tax returns, and neutrality between legal \nvehicles for business. \n30 The  Appendix sets out some basic information about the differences in \ntreatment between employed and self-employed in the areas of taxation (direct and \nindirect), National Insurance contributions and benefits, and employment rights and \nstatus, in order to elucidate points made in the body of the paper. \n x \nINTRODUCTION: CONTEXT AND PARAMETERS \nThe Tax Law Review Committee (TLRC) has been considering the issue of tax \nequity as between the employed and self-employed. This paper reflects part of \nthe work undertaken at the request of the TLRC during its deliberations. \nThe questions addressed by the TLRC project have been broken down as \nfollows: \n• Is it possible to make meaningful comparisons between the employed and \nself-employed or are these two groups too disparate for that to be a sensible \nexercise? \n• Is classification between employed and self-employed adequate to describe \nthe different types of workers in the economy for tax purposes, or are different, \nor further, classifications needed? \n• If we are to retain an employed/self-employed divide, are the current case law \ntests sufficient? Would a statutory test be helpful? \n• To what extent, if at all, should tax and National Insurance classifications be \nconcomitant with employment law categories? \n• What are the differences in taxation treatment and National Insurance \ncontributions (NICs) between the employed and self-employed? \n• Can these tax and National Insurance differences be explained by reference \nto differences of substance between these two groups? \n• Could these tax and National Insurance differences be removed or reduced in \na practical way? \n• What can we learn from the position in other jurisdictions? Are the problems \nexperienced in the UK in any way unique or more extreme than similar problems \nelsewhere? \nThis paper looks primarily at the issue of classification. This is not because the \nother questions asked above are less important. Clearly, if tax and National \nInsurance differences between the groups of workers could be removed, \nclassification would become less important for these purposes. The issues, \nhowever, need to be examined in stages. This particular paper is being published \nfor discussion now because it is topical in the light of recent developments in the \ntax system and employment law. The paper should not be taken as stating any \nconclusions of the TLRC. \n 1Background to the paper \n1\n0.1 In  Reforming the Personal Tax System, the Committee responsible for that \nReport commented: \n‘In any reform it might be sensible to think about reducing the distinction in tax \ntreatment between employment and self-employment, on simple equity grounds as \nmuch as for any other reason. Why should individuals carrying on essentially the same \nactivity and deriving similar income from it, exhibit large differences in liability to \npay income tax just because one does so as a self-employed person while the other is \nemployed?’ \n0.2 This statement reflects a widespread perception of unfairness about the relative \ntax treatment of the employed and the self-employed, current over many years and \nexpressed by many committees and other bodies. This sense of unfairness centres not \nonly on the differences in tax rules themselves but also on differences in \nimplementation and enforcement of tax rules as between the self-employed and the \nemployed. \n0.3 The statement quoted in paragraph 0.1 needs to be submitted to thorough \nexamination. First, the comment presupposes that individuals who are employed can \nbe carrying on a ‘similar activity’ to those who are self-employed. Some would argue \nthat, even where an employed and a self-employed person seem to be undertaking \nsimilar tasks, there is a fundamental difference in the nature of their activities. In other \nwords, the classification of the person as either employed or self-employed arises \nfrom a genuine and fundamental difference, so that describing them as carrying on \nsimilar activities is inaccurate. This view, of course, assumes that the legal \nclassifications are always based on real differences. Others would disagree, taking the \nview that whilst frequently the activities of the employed and the self-employed may \nbe very different, it is possible for them to be carrying on similar activities. This is \nbecause, at the margins, the legal classification as employed or self-employed may not \nmark a fundamental distinction of substance. The extent to which the classification \nsystem really does mark some difference of substance between types of activity \nrequires further consideration of the classifications of ‘employed’ and ‘self-\nemployed’ and the way in which they are applied.  \n0.4 Second, the statement in paragraph 0.1 assumes that horizontal equity should \nbe the guiding policy objective – that is, that individuals with similar levels of income \nshould bear similar tax burdens. This supposes that it is possible to find comparable \nmeasures of income for employed and self-employed. Even assuming that this is so, \nhorizontal equity is likely to be only one policy consideration. Some, including \ngovernment, might say that other policy objectives (for example, correcting market \nfailures or providing incentives for certain activities) or practical considerations might \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n (1993) Commentary no. 35, Institute for Fiscal Studies, London. \n 2 \nhave to override horizontal equity in some situations. The statement therefore raises \nmore complex questions than might at first appear. \n0.5 The TLRC decided in 1996 to examine this topic in greater detail. The terms \nof reference that it set for this project were \n‘To consider the differences in tax treatment between the employed and the self-\nemployed and the extent to which tax liabilities of similarly placed individuals \ndiffered as a result.’  \n0.6 The tax differences that are the primary focus of discontent in this area in the \nUK are well known and centre mainly on the rules on deduction of expenses and \ntaxation of benefits and on timing and method of collection of taxation. The general \nview is that the differences in the rules favour the self-employed, and this is broadly \ntrue, though there are circumstances in which the rules operate to the advantage of \n2\nemployees.  \n0.7 The pure tax issues cannot be investigated sensibly in isolation. Differences in \nthe NICs required of the employed and the self-employed are a central part of the \nquestion. As can be seen from the Appendix to this paper, the self-employed pay \nlower NICs than the employed, especially if the employer’s contribution as well as the \nemployee’s is taken into account. To some extent, this can be explained in terms of \nthe benefits to which the two groups are entitled, and this links to the contributory \nprinciple still said to underlie the National Insurance system. It is widely agreed, \nhowever, that the self-employed under-contribute to the National Insurance Fund, \n3\neven allowing for their reduced entitlements. Some would argue that this is simply \nrecognition of other burdens on the self-employed, but the linkage is not \n4\nstraightforward.  \n0.8 Additionally, the relationship with employment law is important in \nconsidering the tax issues of classification. It might seem that the tax and employment \nlaw classifications of employment status should be the same wherever possible, not \nleast to reduce confusion and compliance costs, but further investigation raises \nquestions about whether this is necessarily correct, given the different objectives of \nthe two systems. Divergences may be desirable, but any divergence will create \n                                                                                                                                            \n2\n For a more detailed discussion of these differences, see J. Freedman and E. Chamberlain, \n‘Horizontal equity and the taxation of employed and self-employed workers’, (1997) Fiscal \nStudies, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 87–118 (hereafter, Freedman and Chamberlain 1997) and the \nAppendix to this paper. \n3\n Freedman and Chamberlain 1997 at p.102; The Modernisation of Britain’s Tax and Benefit \nSystem, Number Two: Work Incentives: A Report by Martin Taylor, (1998) HM Treasury, \nLondon (hereafter the Taylor Report 1998); L.

Here, as usual with taxation, a balance must be found \nbetween designing a system that is equitable in all its details and one that is cost-\neffective and practical to administer. For example, changes that would interfere with \ndeduction at source under the PAYE system and the fact that the majority of \nemployees in the UK do not complete a tax return might be unacceptable for \nadministrative reasons. \n0.10 In February 1997 an article arising from work undertaken on behalf of the \nTLRC was published, entitled ‘Horizontal equity and the taxation of employed and \n6\nself-employed workers’. This attempted to summarise the issues and problems \nsurrounding the taxation of the self-employed and the employed in a structured way \nwith a view to stimulating a focused debate. Some helpful comments were received \nand discussions held in the TLRC and with others. This paper continues one aspect of \nthis debate: the issue of classification of workers as employed or self-employed for tax \nand NICs purposes. \nAlignment of tax treatment of employed and self-employed \n0.11 One starting-point that has sometimes been suggested for reform would be to \nalign all or some aspects of the tax treatment of the employed and self-employed. The \nargument is that reducing such differences would make determining whether someone \nis self-employed or employed – ‘the classification issue’ – less significant and \ntherefore less problematic.  \n0.12 Reducing these differences is not simple. Major structural reform extending \nbeyond the immediate issues being considered by the TLRC could be required. \nChange could bring with it new administrative difficulties and even new inequities, as \nwell as solutions to existing problems. \n0.13 One change that has been discussed by a number of organisations, most \n7\nrecently the Better Regulation Task Force, is a full-scale merger of tax and NICs. \nMuch of the motivation behind this pressure has been concern about compliance costs \nof running two different systems side by side. The cost of NICs collection, like PAYE, \n                                                                                                                                            \n5\n For some relevant details on employment law, see Appendix to this paper. \n6\n Freedman and Chamberlain 1997, fn. 2 above. \n7\n The Better Regulation Task Force, The Burden of Payroll Regulations, 2000 www.cabinet-\noffice.gov.uk/regulation/index/task.htm (hereafter the Better Regulation Task Force 2000). \n 4 \n8\ncertainly adds to the burdens of taking on employees. Merger of tax and NICs would \nnot necessarily align the treatment of the employed and self-employed – they could \nstill be charged different rates – but, in practice, treating NICs as a form of taxation \nwould add force to arguments for alignment. It is largely the philosophy of the \ncontributory principle which is relied upon to justify the higher NICs paid by and on \nbehalf of employees than by the self-employed. In fact, the structure of NICs for the \nself-employed has begun to alter in recent Budgets, partly as a result of \n9\nrecommendations made by the Taylor Report. Already, this has had the effect of \nsignificantly reducing the benefit to the self-employed from the NICs structure. \nFurther changes, announced in the November 2000 Pre-Budget Report, have \n10\ncontinued in this direction. \n0.14 In addition, the Contributions Agency has merged with the Inland Revenue \nand most NICs appeals are now heard by the Tax Appeal Commissioners. This has \nhad an important impact on the issues under discussion.  \n0.15 Complete alignment of the tax and NICs systems, however, seems some way \n11\noff. The Better Regulation Task Force stated:  \n‘We understand that a full-scale merger of tax and National Insurance can only be a \nlong-term goal as it involves major questions of both tax and social policy. In \naddition, there would be substantial systems implications for the Revenue and for \nemployers. However we feel it is important that the Government is aware of the \nconsensus in favour of such a merger amongst both the representative bodies and the \nindividuals who contributed their views to our report. This takes us into areas of social \npolicy and it is not our job to suggest how further integration might be achieved.’  \n0.16 The government has stated that it is not convinced that radical reform of the \ntax and NICs systems is the best way of delivering worthwhile simplifications for \nemployers. In a discussion paper, it proposes instead changes of a more technical \n12\nnature. This has been criticised as inadequate. The Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of England and Wales has called for more root-and-branch reform, \n13\nincluding a review of the contributory principle. A representative of the Chartered \nInstitute of Taxation commented: \n                                                                                                                                            \n8\n Centre for Fiscal Studies, University of Bath, The Tax Compliance Costs for Employers of \nPAYE and National Insurance in 1995–96, (1998) Inland Revenue Economics Paper no. 3, \nInland Revenue, London (hereafter the Bath Report). \n9\n The Taylor Report 1998. \n10\n See Appendix to this paper. \n11\n The Better Regulation Task Force 2000, fn. 7 above. \n12\n Inland Revenue, Simplifying National Insurance Contributions for Employers, (2000) \nInland Revenue, London. \n13\n ICAEW, 7 September 2000, TAXREP 28/00 www.taxfac.co.uk. \n 5‘There is only one prize worth winning in the race to simplify taxes on employees. \n14\nThat is the merging of tax and National Insurance Contributions …’. \n0.17 There has been movement towards alignment of the tax and National \nInsurance systems, and the contributory principle has been losing its central role in \n15\nsocial security policy over recent years. It is important that further work on \nintegration should be undertaken and discussion of this possibility should continue. \nThere are, however, immense and deep-rooted political difficulties with radical \nchange. The contributory principle remains an important one for many, even though it \nis being undermined in practice. In addition, both main political parties have \nundertaken not to increase income tax rates. This makes total integration in the near \nfuture seem unlikely, which suggests that other options also need to be explored. \n0.18 Another area where alignment has often been proposed is in relation to the \nrules on computation of income for employees and the self-employed. The difference \nin the rules is sometimes blamed upon the schedular system in the UK. Some \njurisdictions without a schedular system, however, also apply different rules to \n16\ndifferent types of income. There are real differences between the gross income of \narchetypal self-employed activities, from which a profit figure has to be extracted in \nsome way, and standard salary income. The true extent of these differences in \ndifferent situations is discussed in the following chapters of this paper. Nevertheless, \nthere are areas where some alignment of rules might be thought possible. For \nexample, there is widespread support for a relaxation of the current strict rule for \nemployees’ deductions of expenses, bringing it closer to that for the self-employed – \n17\nfor example, by removal of the requirement that deductible expenses be ‘necessary’. \n0.19 To align these rules for the two groups in this or other ways, however, might \nresult in problems and complexities that could not be managed in practice within the \ncurrent cumulative PAYE system of deduction at source. The strict rules for \ndeductibility of expenditure by employees may be restrictive and sometimes seem \n                                                                                                                                            \n14\n Anne Redston, Chartered Institute of Taxation Press Release, 5 September 2000, [2000] \nSimon’s Tax Intelligence (STI) 1377.  \n15\n IFS Green Budget 1999, fn. 3 above. \n16\n A number of countries without a schedular system – Spain and Germany, for example – \nhave different rules for deduction of expenses for employees and the self-employed; \nInternational Bureau of Fiscal Documentation, European Tax Handbook, (2000) IBFD, \nAmsterdam. \n17\n By various bodies including: Codification Committee, Report of the Committee on \nCodification of Income Tax Law, (1936) Cmd 5131, HMSO, London; Radcliffe Committee, \nFinal Report of the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income, (1955) Cmd \n9474, HMSO, London (hereafter the Radcliffe Committee), chapter 5; Institute of Taxation, \nRepresentations on the Form and Administration of the Taxation System, (1989) Institute of \nTaxation, London.

Baron, The Taxation of Employees and the \nSelf-Employed, (1998) Research Paper, Institute of Directors, London [hereafter IOD paper \n1998].) \n 6 \nunfair but they have a simplifying result. Since almost no deductions are permitted, \nthe need for year-end adjustments and communication between the taxpayer and \nInland Revenue is reduced and, in many cases, eliminated. Only standard allowances \nfor employees would fit easily into such a system. It can be seen that radical change in \none area requires consideration to ensure that an improvement for some does not \nmake tax more complex for many, or create such a level of compliance and \nadministrative costs that the burden outweighs the benefits overall.  \n0.20 The cumulative PAYE system works well for taxpayers who have a clear \nemployment status and work for one employer for a number of years. In cases of non-\nstandard work, however – for example, casual workers – it has been suggested that \ncumulative PAYE is breaking down. In addition, cumulative PAYE imposes burdens \non employers and is regressive in effect so that small businesses suffer the greatest \n18\nburden. Tax evasion by non-standard workers is also an issue that some argue should \n19\nbe tackled by more widespread deduction at source from non-standard workers. \nFurther work in this area is needed but, as with NICs, radical change would have \nmajor implications and is not likely in the near future. Again, this makes it important \nto consider the classification issue at this time, since alignment of the rules for all \nworkers seems so difficult to achieve in practice.  \nClassification and the changing labour market \n0.21 One reason for these practical and other difficulties of alignment is that there \nis often, but not always, a fundamental structural and organisational difference \nbetween the self-employed and the employed. They may play different roles in the \nlabour market, and risk allocation between them and the firm to which they are \nsupplying services differs depending on their relationship. \n0.22 Where these economic and social differences exist, arguably the employed and \nself-employed are not in comparable positions. They may be doing similar work and \nreceiving similar financial benefits, but they are playing a different role in the labour \nmarket because of risk allocation and positioning in relation to the firm. This different \nrole might make direct comparisons of their tax treatments inappropriate, even if \nsuperficially they seem to be in similar financial positions. At the very least, the tax \ncomparison has to take account of these different economic roles, even if the \nconclusion is that the differences are insufficient to warrant different tax treatment. \n                                                                                                                                            \n18\n The Better Regulation Task Force 2000, fn. 7 above, citing the Bath Report, fn. 8 above. \nSee also report of the Select Committee on the Treasury (Sixth Report HC 199/1998/9). \n19\n For example, see Report of the Committee on Enforcement Powers of the Revenue \nDepartments, (1983) Cmnd 8822, HMSO, London (hereafter the Keith Report); but see Lord \nGrabiner QC, The Informal Economy, (2000) HM Treasury, London, at para. 4.10 of that \npaper, discussed below at para. 4.10. \n 70.23 To the extent that there are fundamental structural and economic differences \nbetween the self-employed and the employed, which are reflected in the method of \nclassification for tax purposes, there may be no inequity in the different tax treatments \naccorded to each group. If, however, there can be differences in tax classification \nwithout any serious substantive difference existing in fact between some who are \ncategorised as self-employed and some who are employees, then different tax \ntreatments might well be inequitable and comparisons need to be made. \n0.24 A sensible starting-point, therefore, is to examine whether the current method \nof classification between the self-employed and the employed for tax purposes is \nconsistent and fair and to what extent it does indeed reflect real structural and \neconomic differences in their positions. The current test is based primarily on case law \ndrawn from many areas of law, though there are some statutory adjustments. Some \nwould suggest further statutory intervention, whilst others consider the flexibility of \ncase law to be helpful in changing circumstances. These issues are considered further \nin this paper. \n0.25 Conditions and the nature of work are undergoing changes. At the margins, the \ndistinction between the employed and self-employed was never entirely clear-cut, and \nnow there are a growing number of workers occupying intermediate positions (or \n‘grey areas’) between the two clear ends of the employed/self-employed spectrum. \nThis has had consequences for employment law as well as for taxation, both of which \nare adapting in their own ways to meet the problem. Whether tax law is adapting \nsensibly is one of the questions discussed further in this paper. The question of the \nrelationship between tax law and employment law and whether they can and should \ndevelop in tandem also requires discussion. There may be different policy objectives \nand practical considerations in the tax and employment fields. On the other hand, \ndifferences between classifications for these two purposes can cause cost and \nconfusion for workers and employers and are particularly problematic in relation to \nNICs. Although NICs need to follow the tax classification for collection purposes, the \npayment of these NICs also relates to benefits in some cases, and in this sense NICs \nmight be thought to be more closely related to employment status for labour law \npurposes. NICs straddle the two areas of tax and employment law, making divergence \nbetween the two problematic. \n0.26 Employment legislation is moving away from the traditional methods of \nclassification between the self-employed and the employed. In a research report \n20\npublished by the European Commission, it is suggested that the nature of work is \nchanging, away from the job whose prototype was manufacturing, to a new type of \nwork, where the prototype is the service relationship. This new type of work requires \nnew institutional forms and new ways of protecting workers. \n                                                                                                                                            \n20\n European Commission D-G V, Transformation of Labour and Future of Labour Law in \nEurope: Final Report, (1999) CE-19-98-302-EN-C EUR-OP, Luxembourg. \n 8 \n0.27 This changing nature of work is leading to labour law developments \nthroughout Europe and elsewhere. In the UK, recent legislation has given non-\nstandard workers (not defined as employees under the case law) some of the same \n21\nrights as employees in some circumstances. The Employment Relations Act 1999 \ncontains a wide power for government to extend existing employment rights to other \n22\nworkers. In doing so, it follows the recommendations of a research report published \nby the DTI, which suggested that a move away from the employed/self-employed \ndivide could both extend basic rights to persons requiring protection and reduce \n23\nuncertainty in the operation of employment law. \n0.28 On the tax front, there have been fundamental changes in classification and \ncollection in the construction industry, recognising that traditional case law tests of \nemployment and self-employment are no longer sufficient to recognise the economic \ncomplexities. The structure and operation of these might give some guidance on how \n24\neffective similar changes for other groups would be. The tax system might attempt to \nidentify each non-standard example and specify special treatment for such groups. \nSuch multi-classification must be balanced, however, with administrative feasibility. \nOn the other hand, multi-classification may be necessary if the tax system is to deal \nfairly with the complexities that exist as a matter of economic reality.  \n0.29 The legislation in the Finance Act 2000 dealing with personal service \ncompanies and other intermediaries, colloquially known as IR35, is another example \n25\nof an attempt to adapt the tax system to meet changing work practices. This \nlegislation deems certain workers to receive Schedule E payments, even though the \nservices of those workers are supplied through an intermediary company or \npartnership and payments are made to the worker by the intermediary in a way not \nsubject to Schedule E taxation under normal rules. \n0.30 In effect, the IR35 legislation seeks to ‘look through’ the intermediary \narrangement in cases where the ‘real’ relationship is one of employment by the client, \nalthough the compliance burden and cost of PAYE and NICs payments is put onto the \nintermediary and not the client. Only tax law and NICs are affected: the legislation is \ncareful not to deem the individual to be an employee and employment law remains \nunchanged. The critical test of the relationship used for IR35 tax purposes is the case \nlaw test for employment or self-employment. The original proposal was for a special \nstatutory test based on control, but this was quickly rejected as inadequate. The \ncontentious IR35 legislation therefore places a new burden on the case law on \n                                                                                                                                            \n21\n For examples, see Chapter 4 below. \n22\n Section 23. \n23\n B.

Although the original \nmotivation for the change in law was to tackle the use of intermediaries set up purely \nfor tax and NICs purposes, the resulting legislation risks going wider and covering \narrangements that exist as a result of the economics and market practices of an \nindustry and not purely for tax reasons. Due to the difficulty of distinguishing \nemployees from the self-employed as described in Chapters 2 and 3, the legislation \nmay catch workers who are attempting to create their own business but are at an early \nstage of this process. This has the curious result that the legislation could deter the \nvery entrepreneurs the government seeks to encourage in other contexts.  \n0.32 The IR35 legislation has caused considerable disquiet amongst certain sectors \nof business (particularly the IT sector), industry and the tax professions. The reaction \nto it and the difficulty the Inland Revenue has encountered in producing sensible rules \nhighlight the worker classification problem as well as other structural problems \nrelating to the integration of corporate and personal taxation. IR35 is discussed further \nin the chapters below in the context of the classification test, although a full critique \n26\nof the legislation is beyond the scope of this paper. \n0.33 One of the difficulties of the current tax system is that it is attempting to deal \nwith a spectrum of workers. It is inevitable that the focus both of the Inland Revenue \nand of taxpayers will be on ‘hard cases’: those workers at the borderline of the \nemployee/self-employed classification – the ‘grey area’. The vast majority of the \nworking population, however, will fall clearly within one category or another. Any \nproposals for reform should not unsettle the position of the many for the sake of the \nfew, nor should the classification rules be distorted in an attempt to deal with more \nfundamental structural problems of the tax system. \nObjectives of this paper \n0.34 Radical reform, such as integration of tax and NICs or changes to the PAYE \nsystem, might be the only way to eliminate completely the problems of equity between \nthe employed and self-employed. This paper does not address these issues further but \nthis should not be taken as a comment one way or the other on the desirability of these \nreforms. Other issues of importance, such as methods of tax collection and differences \nin rules on computation, are also not addressed here. \n                                                                                                                                            \n26\n The Professional Contractors Group has been granted leave to proceed with a judicial \nreview on the basis that the personal intermediary provisions in the Welfare Reform and \nPensions Act 1999 and the Finance Act 2000 are incompatible with EC law and the Human \nRights Act 1998: decision of High Court 10/10/2000 (Evening Standard, 10/10/2000). \n 10 \n0.35 It is important that these issues continue to be discussed and researched. \nWhilst this wider work continues, however, the TLRC feels that publication of this \ndiscussion paper purely on classification issues is timely and helpful in the light of \nrecent tax and employment law developments. This paper represents the thoughts and \nresearch of those working directly on the project. They do not necessarily reflect the \nviews of the TLRC, which has discussed the issues and has authorised the publication \nof this paper to place the issues in a broader context and encourage informed debate.  \n0.36 Chapter 1 of this paper describes in more detail some of the problems \nencountered in trying to classify workers. Chapter 2 examines the evidence on \nchanging work patterns and considers the implications of this for the legal rules on \nclassification. Legal classifications are considered in detail in Chapter 3, which \ndiscusses the tests evolved in case law arising out of cases in many areas of law – \nprimarily tax, National Insurance and labour law – and the relationship between them. \nChapter 4 looks at legislative responses, both employment law and tax, to special \ncases where the case law has proved inadequate to deal with changing working \npractices. It examines the extent to which employment law has developed a different \napproach from tax law to classification and considers the arguments for consistency \nand separate development. Chapter 5 examines decision-making mechanisms for \nclassification of workers for tax, National Insurance and labour law purposes. Finally, \nin Chapter 6, we sum up the main points arising from this paper and discuss some of \nthe options for improving worker classification, as well as setting out some more \nfundamental questions for future research and consideration. \n \n 11CHAPTER 1: THE PROBLEM OF CLASSIFICATION \nWorkers cover a broad spectrum. At each end of this spectrum, the features of \nthe employed and self-employed can be clearly distinguished. The unequivocally \nself-employed person will be running a business on his own account, bearing the \nrisk of loss, investing capital and independent of his clients. In a tax context, it \nwould be impractical, if not impossible, to deduct tax at source from his gross \nincome.  \nAn unequivocally employed person in a long-term job will receive a wage or \nsalary. He is more likely to be subject to some kind of direct supervision and will \nbe integrated into the business to which he is supplying his services. It will be \npractical and convenient to require the employer to deduct tax at source from \nsuch an employee and a cumulative PAYE system will work well.  \nThere are workers who do not fit either of these two descriptions precisely, but \nlie somewhere between the two ends of this spectrum. They may be described as \noccupying a ‘grey area’ at the borderline of the classification divide. Such \nworkers may find themselves classified differently for different legal purposes.  \nSome differences in rules may operate unfairly even as between workers clearly \nand properly classified on one side or other of the divide. For example, some \nunequivocal employees will incur genuine expenses that they cannot deduct \nunder the current rules. It is in relation to the group in the ‘grey area’, however, \nthat the question of inequity between the employed and self-employed is most \nlikely to be raised. This chapter examines the range of workers through the use \nof an example, in preparation for the discussion in Chapter 2 of changing work \npractices and in Chapter 3 of the classification process. \n \n1.1 As discussed in the introduction to this paper, if differences in treatment of \ndifferent types of worker could be eliminated or reduced, classification would be \nreduced in importance. There are, however, practical difficulties in achieving this, as \nwell as policy reasons against moves in this direction. A sensible alternative starting-\npoint, therefore, is to examine whether the current method of classification for tax and \nlegal purposes, which divides the employed from the self-employed, is fair and \noperated consistently and, as far as possible, in accordance with real economic \ndifferences between these groups of worker. If it is, differences in tax treatment may \nbe justifiable to some extent.  \n1.2 Ideally, the classification system should be one that results in different tax \nliabilities being based on genuine distinctions and differences in income. In addition, \nthe administrative systems used to decide and give guidance upon classification need \nto be clear and efficient, so that individual taxpayers, business and the Inland Revenue \ncan operate them speedily and without unreasonable burden.  \n 12 \nLegal and other types of classification \n1.3 This paper uses the term ‘economic classification’ to be distinct from ‘legal \nclassification’. Lawyers, economists, sociologists and others use the terms ‘employed’ \nand ‘self-employed’ but not necessarily in exactly the same way or with the same \nconnotations.  \n1.4 To the lawyer, the employed/self-employed divide represents a distinction that \ncan have significant legal consequences. To assess the worker’s rights and liabilities, \nit is necessary to know clearly on which side of the line he falls. Subject to any special \nlegislative provisions, this will be decided on the basis of the contractual rights and \nliabilities between the worker and the person or body to which he is supplying \nservices. It is not purely a matter of the label or conditions agreed by the parties to the \ncontract. Under UK case law, a court will assess the real nature of the relationship \nbased on all the facts, but this will be the real nature of the relationship in law. \nChapter 3 of this paper discusses in detail the way in which the courts approach this \ntask. Courts look at a multitude of factors, and simply drafting a contract in one way \nor another will not put a worker on one side of the line or other. On the other hand, \nsince ultimately the court must come down on one side or the other, slight contractual \nchange (consistent with the actual relationship) can make a difference to status in \nborderline cases. \n1.5 Within this legal scheme of things, all is black or white. There are difficult \ncases but no shades of grey. That this can over-simplify has been recognised by the \nlaw in some instances. For example, employment legislation increasingly uses the \nterm ‘worker’, with a broad definition to extend employment rights to a wider class of \n1\nperson than employee. There are tax and National Insurance provisions that deem \n2\ncertain taxpayers to be employees or treat them in some ways as if they were. For \nlegal purposes, however, even if additional categories are added or deeming \nprovisions are used, ultimately lines must be drawn. \n1.6 In practice, workers do not fall neatly within this binary classification but \ncover a broad spectrum. At each end of this spectrum, the features of the employed \nand self-employed can be clearly distinguished. At the extreme self-employed end, the \nworker will be running a business on his own account, investing capital, bearing the \nrisk of loss and liability for his work and benefiting from the profits. He will contract \nto perform specified tasks rather than working for fixed hours. He will be independent \nand not integrated into the business organisations of his clients, of which there will be \nseveral. He may well have employees of his own. At the other end of the spectrum \nwill be the employee, receiving a wage or salary, subject to some kind of direct \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n The main statutes conferring such rights are the Wages Act 1986, The National Minimum \nWage Act 1998 and the Working Time Regulations 1998 and this category of workers \nafforded protection may be extended under the Employment Relations Act 1999. \n2\n See Chapter 4 below. \n 13supervision and integrated into the business to which he is supplying his services. \nLawyers and economists are likely to agree without difficulty on these paradigm cases. \n1.7 There are other workers, however, who do not fit either of these two \ndescriptions precisely but lie somewhere between the two ends of this spectrum along \na continuum. This group will exhibit a mixture of standard characteristics. Most \ncommonly, they will supply labour only, but retain some degree of independence from \nthe business organisation paying them. For legal purposes, often they must be \nclassified on one or other side of the line even if they do not fit neatly. As a result, \nsmall differences in contractual arrangements may put them on one side of the legal \nemployed/self-employed classification, even though they are carrying on a similar \n3\nactivity to another worker who has been placed on the other side. It is possible that \nthe resulting classification may not reflect their economic role in the firm as described \nbelow. We have called this group borderline or ‘grey area’ workers. They may need \n4\nnew legal classifications to fit them. \n1.8 Indeed, some new legal classifications are being developed. Workers who are \nnot traditional employees but who have a high degree of economic dependence on one \n‘employer’ as ‘employee-like’ are defined in German law (‘arbeitsnehmerahnliche \n5\nPersonen’) and also found in the UK concept of ‘workers’ and the Italian \n6\n‘parasubordinati’, which originated in a fiscal context.

In this case, their main interest will \nbe in the relationship of dependence or otherwise between the worker and the firm, his \n8\ndegree of integration into the firm and the way in which risk is allocated. \n1.10 The way in which firms organise their work has implications for the economy. \nVertical disintegration by using workers external to the firm may create cost \nefficiencies, such as paying for workers only when needed. Equally, it may have \ndisadvantages – for example, in terms of lost loyalty or knowledge – which bring their \n9\nown costs. Decisions on these matters have an economic impact. They result in \ndifferent levels of risk allocation. In this sense, these different types of worker have \ndifferent economic roles. \n1.11 There is an obvious interaction between the economic classification of workers \nand their legal classification. In some senses, the legal tests are similar to the \norganisational interests of economists. To some degree, the relationship that \neconomists are interested in is one created by law, since risk allocation and \ndependence will often be determined contractually. At each end of the spectrum there \nwill be broad agreement, but at the border the economist may be content to accept that \nhybrid workers exist, whereas for legal purposes they must be placed on one side of \nthe line or the other. \nAn example \n1.12 An example may assist. \n• A is a photographer employed by E, a newspaper. He works part-time – 15 hours \nper week – for a regular wage, with five weeks paid holiday, is entitled to sick pay \nand paid holidays, is a member of a pension scheme, has a company car and is \nentitled to one month’s notice of termination of contract. He must attend E’s offices, \nor anywhere else he is sent, and is directed on subject matter although not the detail \nof how to take the pictures. His equipment is provided. He needs permission to work \nfor anyone else and may not substitute another worker for himself. \n• B is a photographer. He has a contract with E under which he is paid by the hour. \nHe provides his own equipment but takes pictures as and when directed in the same \nway as A and may not provide a substitute to do the work. In practice, he works 15 \nhours a week for E and for nobody else but he has no entitlement to be engaged for \nthis number of hours. He is not entitled to any sick pay, holidays, pension or a car. \n• C is a photographer who works for E as and when called upon at an hourly rate. \nHe receives no other payments or benefits. He provides his own equipment and can \n                                                                                                                                            \n8\n See, for example, the more fluid and complex approach to classification in D. Marsden, A \nTheory of Employment Systems, (1999) OUP, Oxford. \n9\n D. Marsden, fn. 8 above, at p. 40. \n 15send a substitute in his place but he or his substitute must take pictures as directed. \nHe works for at least 10 other clients over a 12-month period although he customarily \nworks 15 hours a week for E. \nIn this example, A would be classified as an employee and C as self-employed. B is \non the borderline. In practice, B seems to undertake almost identical activities to those \nof A, but he has no entitlement to regular work or pay and provides his own \nequipment. Changes to these conditions, which might make little or no difference in \npractice, could put B on one side of the line or the other for legal purposes. For \nexample, giving B an entitlement to a minimum number of hours work would make B \nlook more like an employee. The absence of this entitlement, or the ability to \nsubstitute another worker, would be a significant factor in making him self-employed. \nTo an economist, B is probably a wage-labourer at this stage, regardless of his legal \nclassification.  \nIt is important to note, however, that B could be a budding entrepreneur, in the \nprocess of setting up the machinery to take on other work. This might be exactly the \ntype of nascent small business that it is general government policy to encourage. \nEventually and given the right conditions, B might take on staff himself. He might \nneed to pay for machinery, business training or other expenses which could be non-\ndeductible for tax purposes if he was an employee but deductible if self-employed. At \nthe point described, his legal status would depend in part on the extent to which he \nwas integrated into E’s firm, in terms of his bureaucratic relationship with it. This \nmight be difficult to assess purely from the legal conditions in the one contract with E, \nsince it will also depend on the nature of other relationships, possibly established after \nthe contract with E is entered into. Thus B’s status as an employee or self-employed \nmight not be something that could be assessed ex ante, but only with hindsight of the \ndevelopment of B’s business. This can make it very difficult to know whether, for \nlegal purposes, B should be compared with A or with C in terms of equality of \ntreatment, even if we accept that A and C need to be treated differently for practical \nand conceptual reasons. \nE calculates the payments to A, B and C on the basis that E receives a package of \nservices that is similar from each but takes different risks in each case and provides \nequipment and other benefits for some and not others. In a perfect market and with \nperfect information, a price could be worked out for each that puts E in the same \nfinancial position regardless of which worker it uses and puts each worker in the same \nfinancial position (because risk is compensated for by higher pay). In practice, firms \nclearly do consider that there is a difference between these modes of delivery of \nservices. They choose one arrangement over the other because they consider it to be \nmore efficient. Factors such as loyalty, risk and maintaining knowledge levels may be \ndifficult to value but may have important efficiency implications, so pushing the \nchoice in one direction or another. The cost savings of not having employees (in terms \nof lower administration costs and fewer employment law liabilities) may not always \nbe passed on in full to the worker.  \n 16 \nIn one sense, A, B and C are engaged in identical activity because they all take \npictures on behalf of E. In theory, they could be paid equivalent compensation \npackages. This does not, however, put them in identical economic positions in the \nsense that A and C are playing different economic roles in the labour market. A is an \nemployee, integrated into E’s firm. C is running a business on his own account \n(whether or not he has employees). In economic terms, B might be described as a \n10\n‘disguised wage-labourer’ or a ‘dependent self-employed’ – a hybrid. \nThis has implications for the way in which these taxpayers receive their income and \nfor the taxation of that income. Even though they are all taking photographs, these \nthree workers have different levels of integration into E’s firm and bear different risks. \nC may be paid more than A to compensate for this risk – a ‘risk premium’. Whether \nhe is or not, a question arises in measuring the income of A and C and deciding \nwhether what they receive is equivalent. Some account will need to be taken of C’s \nadditional expenses, which is relatively straightforward, but also of any risk premium \npaid to him. Is his income comparable to that of A? Are we comparing like with like? \nA and C will need to be treated differently on a practical level. A receives a regular \nwage and benefits in kind. He has few, if any, expenses. He can easily have tax \ndeducted at source by his employer under a system that requires no contact between \nhim and the Inland Revenue, but any special allowance for expenses could \ncompromise the feasibility of this process. C has payments from a number of clients \nand various overheads and other expenses and will not necessarily receive or be able \nto calculate his final profit until some time after he has earned it. Deduction at source \nfrom gross revenues would raise practical difficulties and it would only be possible to \nmake estimated payments on account until profits for the period had been calculated. \nInevitably, the year-end profit calculation will be more complex than that for A. C \ndoes not receive fringe benefits, which may be taxed more lightly than cash payments. \nIt may be an over-simplification, therefore, to say that A and C are in comparable \npositions and that the income they derive from their activities is similar in all respects. \nThis is not to say that comparisons cannot be made, nor, necessarily, that horizontal \nequity cannot be aimed at – merely that care has to be taken in any comparison of the \ntwo. \nThe position with B is more difficult yet. The question for tax purposes is whether he \nshould be treated more akin to A or to C. In practice, since he has attributes of both, \nwe might choose to apply a mixture of rules to him, but that could raise administrative \ndifficulties. For example, deduction at source may work for him as he works for only \none firm. Since, however, he takes a greater risk than A (in that in any one week there \n11\nmay not be 15 hours, or indeed any, work and has no entitlement to sick pay), part of \nhis pay is a ‘risk premium’ and part covers him for the fact that he receives no fringe \n                                                                                                                                            \n10\n These terms are discussed further in Chapter 2 below. \n11\n H. Collins, ‘Employment rights of casual workers’, (2000) 29 Industrial Law Journal 73 \n(hereafter Collins 2000). \n 17benefits. In addition, he does have some expenses that it would seem unfair not to \nallow for tax purposes.  \nA, B and C also need to be classified for employment law and other legal purposes. \nSome of the relevant issues are similar to those that arise for tax purposes. There may \nalso be different considerations in the case of employment law, especially in the case \nof B. For tax purposes, it is only necessary to classify B in respect of the work he \nactually undertakes for E, so that the parties to the contract know how to deal with \npayments made for that work. A further question that might arise in connection with \n12\nemployment law is whether B has any employment protection rights should E not \nprovide him with work at some point. \nThis example can become further complicated if it is decided on the facts that B is an \nemployee in law, but he then sets up a company or other legal intermediary through \nwhich to supply his services to E. The IR35 legislation, referred to in the introduction \n13\nto this paper, seeks to ensure that he will not be able to use an intermediary to \nconvert Schedule E income into corporate income, on which the tax and NICs would \nnot be so great. This is on the basis that B is to be compared with, and treated equally \nto, an employee. This is, however, the critical question. Is this the fair comparison to \nmake? In some cases it will be, but in others B will be in the course of setting up a \nbusiness. Incorporation of a company as a vehicle may be one step in this process. It \ncan be seen that it is extremely difficult to distinguish between a pure service provider \nwho is essentially a wage-labourer and an entrepreneur at the beginning of the \nbusiness building process. This is one basis for the current attacks on IR35. \nStructural difficulties facing reform and issues for discussion \n1.13 This example illustrates the difficulty of comparing workers playing different \neconomic roles and fitting them into legal classifications where those classifications \nresult in different tax and other consequences. Many other variations could have been \ndescribed.  \n1.14 The tax system could create an intermediate classification or attempt to \nidentify each non-standard example and specify how each should be classified and \n14\ndealt with. It would be very difficult to provide in detail for all the possibilities and, \nin any event, such a multi-classification approach would have to be balanced with \nadministrative feasibility. The more classifications there are, the more boundary lines \nthere are to police and to increase uncertainty. On the other hand, multi-classifications \nmay be necessary if the tax system is to deal fairly with the complexities that exist as a \nmatter of economic reality.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n12\n For a brief description of some of these rights, see Appendix to this paper. \n13\n And see Chapter 4 below. \n14\n For examples of how some non-standard workers are treated by legislation and even extra-\nstatutory concession, see Chapter 4 below. \n 18 \n1.15 One major tension is between certainty and the need to cater for the many \nvarieties of working relationship, taking into account a range of factors. Some suggest \nthat the current UK case law test is too uncertain and should be replaced by a more \nobjective, statutory test. The problem is that objective tests, such as the number of \nclients served, can become arbitrary and offer opportunities for manipulation. Case \nlaw may also be better equipped than statute to remain flexible enough to meet \nchanging working conditions, but the concomitant of that is that it will leave \nuncertainties, which can ultimately only be settled by litigation and which may well be \nexpensive and time-consuming. This tension is discussed further in Chapter 3 below. \n1.16 As discussed in the introduction above, these classification problems could be \nreduced by removing the differences in tax and NICs treatments between different \ngroups. The above examples show that there are real differences at each end of the \nworker status spectrum, however, and it would be very difficult to remove all \ndifferences in treatment, though reduction of the differences might be possible. \n1.17 While it is inevitable that the focus is on the ‘hard cases’, it must be \nremembered that the vast majority of the working population will fall clearly within \nthe category either of employed or of self-employed. Any proposals for reform of \nclassification issues must bear this in mind and must not unsettle the position of the \nmany for the sake of the few.  \n1.18 The workers who may be most difficult to classify for legal purposes are those \nengaged in non-standard work. This is a relatively small but significant group that has \nexpanded over recent years. The issue of changing work patterns and the role of these \nworkers in the economy is discussed further in Chapter 2 below. \n 191\nCHAPTER 2: CHANGING WORK PATTERNS \nWorking patterns have changed significantly over the past 20 years. It is not \nclear how they will develop in the future. There are now more non-standard \nworkers than previously: self-employed, part-timers and fixed-short-term \nworkers. Not all these workers present problems for the tax system but some are \nat the borderline of the employed/self-employed classification. This classification \nwas developed when employment patterns were generally more stable and \nstraightforward. The increase in the number of non-standard workers therefore \nhas implications for tax policy, and the characteristics of these workers require \nconsideration when examining the adequacy of tax and other legal classifications \nof workers. \n \n2.1 Work patterns are changing. This is the result of a variety of factors, including \nthe shift from manufacturing to services, technological advances, fragmentation of \nlarger firms, economic cycles, levels of unemployment and government policies to \n2\npromote an ‘enterprise culture’. Self-employment has increased, as have various \ntypes of ‘flexible’ employment (part-time, temporary and fixed-term, homeworking \n3\nand teleworking, for example). The so-called ‘flexible work-force’ now constitutes \nabout one-third of the total employed work-force, with the remaining two-thirds in \n4\npermanent, full-time employment. \n2.2 The increases in self-employment and flexible employment have had an \nimpact on the adequacy of legal definitions of different types of worker. As discussed \nin Chapter 1, legal classifications are generally based on a dual categorisation – a \n5\nworker is employed or self-employed. The economic and sociological reality is that a \nfar greater number of categories than this is required to describe the variety of work \npatterns in widespread use in modern society. Hybrid descriptions can be used by \nsocial scientists in a way that is not practical for the purposes of taxation and \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n This chapter assumes that work as we know it will continue for the foreseeable future, in \nthat we shall not see vastly increased leisure time for most people; on the relationship \nbetween work and leisure and the likelihood of work continuing in some form, see C.

It is this mismatch between socio-economic reality and the \nlegal classifications that creates many of the difficulties encountered in tax, National \nInsurance, employment law and other areas of law. \nThe self-employed \n2.3 The trend towards self-employment can be seen in most developed economies, \n6\nbut was particularly marked in the UK during the 1980s. The level of self-\nemployment in the UK rose from 1.9 million (7.5 per cent of the work-force) in 1979, \n7\nto 3.3 million (12.2 per cent of the work-force) in 1990. To some extent, however, \nthis was a process of catching up with levels in other developed countries. Self-\nemployment has been associated with high levels of unemployment, so we might \nexpect economic growth to have led to lower levels of self-employment in the more \n8\nrecent past. In the UK, the 1997/98 Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimate was that 3.2 \n9\nmillion (12.4 per cent of the work-force) were self-employed. So the rise has not \ncontinued, but neither has there been a fall. \n2.4 During the period of increase in self-employment in the UK, there was a \ndecrease in the proportion of self-employed who employed others – from 40 per cent \n10\nin 1981 to 31 per cent by 1991. The latest DTI figures show that, of 3.7 million \nbusinesses in existence in the UK in 1999, over 2.3 million (some 62 per cent) were \nmade up of sole traders or partnerships without employees (‘size class zero \n11\nbusinesses’). The number of ‘size class zero businesses’ has fallen between 1997 and \n1999, especially in agriculture, construction and the wholesale/retail sectors. In the \nconstruction sector, this may have been due to a move to employee status, coinciding \nwith an Inland Revenue programme to impose correct tax classifications on \n12\nconstruction workers. An increase over the same period in the number of businesses \nwith employees was mainly due to an increase in the number of single-employee \ncompanies (not classified as ‘size class zero’ even if the sole owner/director is the \n13\nemployee). This development could also have tax reasons and may be reversed with \nthe introduction of the new personal service intermediaries legislation. Despite these \n                                                                                                                                            \n6\n OECD 1992, cited in Atkinson and Storey, fn. 2 above, at p. 12. \n7\n M.

Most, but not all, of these will have continued to \n14\nwork on their own rather than developing as entrepreneurs. Others will have \ndeveloped their businesses. These workers are classified as self-employed in the \nstatistics broadly in line with legal classifications, although, since the LFS is based on \n15\nself-reporting, there must be some doubt about borderline cases. Many of these self-\n16\nemployed will fall within the category described above as the ‘grey area’. That is, if \nsubjected to stringent legal analysis, some, or all, of their work might fall on the \nemployed and self-employed borderline and probably onto the employee side of that \nborder. In the small business literature, the self-employed without employees are \nfrequently described as ‘own-account workers’. Some who are very close to \n17\nemployees in characteristics are labelled ‘disguised wage-labourers’. Economists do \n18\nnot see self-employment as identical to the existence of a firm or business, so that we \n‘cannot deduce merely from a rise in self-employment that there has been a rise in \n19\nentrepreneurship, or in small businesses’. \n2.6 We have seen that at each end of the worker spectrum, the self-employed and \nemployees play different economic roles. Risks are allocated differently as between \nthem and the firms to which they are supplying their services. Integration into the \noperations of the firm, in terms of direction and bureaucratic organisation, also \n20\ndiffer. Some ‘own-account’ workers, even though correctly classified as self-\nemployed under legal tests, are properly described in economic terms as ‘disguised \nwage-labourers’ or ‘dependent self-employed’. This is because they are not, and do \n21\nnot seek to be, autonomous players in the labour process. Others may be seen as \n                                                                                                                                            \n14\n The evidence is that few firms grow and a minority of firms account for most job creation: \nStorey 1994, fn. 8 above, ch. 5. \n15\n See the DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above.

Although these latter workers do \nnot have employees initially, they may have a level of autonomy and business \norganisation or they may develop this and take on employees in the future. \n2.7 It is not unique to the UK that a high proportion of the increase in self-\nemployment in the 1980s and 1990s was accounted for by ‘own-account’ workers. \nThis is a phenomenon noted across developed economies and often arises from \ngovernment policies designed to encourage self-employment, particularly amongst \nunemployed people. This inevitably results in the development of self-employed \nbusinesses with relatively low levels of resources. Governments then become \nconcerned about the fact that these ‘own-account’ workers are being classified as self-\nemployed for tax and social security purposes. Work situations that are classed as self-\nemployment primarily in order to reduce tax liabilities are now entitled ‘false self-\nemployment’ by the OECD, and many governments have taken action to combat this \nso-called false self-employment by introducing legislation to reclassify these workers \n22 23\nas employees. Yet, as we shall see, this mixture of incentives, coupled with \nprovisions to prevent certain persons from using them, can create confusion. This \napproach is not logical in a situation where an ‘own-account’ worker can develop into \nan entrepreneur, given the right conditions. \n2.8 Research undertaken to reveal the nature of the working arrangements under \nwhich those who classify themselves as self-employed actually operate listed a \n24\nnumber of factors to determine ‘autonomy versus dependency’. The responses did \nnot usually reveal a straight row of negatives or affirmatives. Thus a simple twofold \nclassification of the self-employed into ‘genuine’ and ‘pseudo’ versions has to be \nrejected as over-simplistic. Instead, the research shows that, for the purposes of \ndescribing the various existing arrangements accurately, the self-employed should be \ndotted along a continuum separating the two extremes. In other words, they cover a \nwide range of working arrangements with no straightforward division between \n25\ndifferent groupings. \n2.9 Much effort has been invested by small business researchers in distinguishing \nthe characteristics of the ‘entrepreneur’ from those of the self-employed person who \n                                                                                                                                            \n22\n OECD, Employment Outlook, June 2000, at p. 177; Davies and Freedland 2000, fn. 6 \nChapter 1 above; paras 3.11 and 3.12 below. \n23\n In the following discussion, and note the personal service intermediaries legislation, \ndiscussed in Chapter 4 below, as a case study. \n24\n B. Burchell and J. Rubery, ‘Categorising self-employment: some evidence from the Social \nChange and Economic Life Initiative in the UK’, (1992) in A. Felstead and P. Leighton (eds), \nThe New Entrepreneurs: Self Employment and Small Business in Europe, Kogan Page, \nLondon; A. Felstead and P. Leighton, ‘Issues, themes and reflections on the “enterprise \nculture”’, (1992) in Felstead and Leighton, ibid. \n25\n This is borne out by the results in the DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction \nabove. These results show that the various tests of dependency do not always point in the \nsame direction – see table 4.2. \n 23will always be a dependent provider of personal services only. Conclusive spotting of \nentrepreneurs is, however, difficult. Storey has carried out an extensive review of \nresearch on defining the characteristics of growth firms. He identifies the three factors \nneeded for growth of a firm as being \n• the background/resources of the entrepreneur,  \n• the nature of the firm itself (e.g. age and sector) and  \n• the strategic decisions taken by the owner manager.  \nHe is forced to conclude, however, that it is very difficult to judge at start-up whether \n26\nthese factors are present. Someone who looks like a ‘disguised wage-labourer’ may \nturn out to be an entrepreneur. \n2.10 This evidence from the small business literature has implications for tax \npolicy. The problem is that, as discussed in Chapter 1, unless all are to be treated in \nexactly the same way, which is not always possible as between those clearly self-\nemployed and those who are clearly employees, tax and other areas of law must draw \na definite line between these categories. There will be significant consequences, \ndepending upon which side of this line a worker falls. This fits uncomfortably with \nwhat has been described as ‘a myriad of patterns of the allocation of contractual risk \n27\nand the degrees and range of bureaucratic controls’. It is very difficult to fine-tune \ntax policy, which has to be based on a crude binary classification, to deliver sensible \nresults over this wide range of work arrangements. \n2.11 For example, governments often wish to offer tax and National Insurance \n28\n‘incentives’ to entrepreneurs who set up their own businesses. If such incentives are \ndirected generally to all the self-employed, there will be an incentive for taxpayers \nwho are closer to the dependency end of the continuum to ensure their affairs and \nrelationships are agreed in such a way that they are treated as self-employed under the \ncase law. It will be very difficult to devise legislation that distinguishes between these \nworkers within the self-employed ‘band’ of the continuum, even though they are at \ndifferent ends of it. Any structural difference in the tax system which is not a \ndeliberate ‘incentive’, but which appears to favour the self-employed over employees, \nwill offer a similar inducement. This is an inevitable reaction to the existence of tax \ndifferences. However carefully the line between employees and the self-employed is \ndrawn for tax or other legal purposes, the range of those quite correctly classified as \n                                                                                                                                            \n26\n Storey 1994, fn. 8 above, at p. 158. \n27\n Collins 1990, fn. 20 above. \n28\n Business owners and their representatives sometimes claim that these incentives merely \nbring them into line with others who do not have to bear the burdens and costs of running a \nbusiness. This again raises the question, discussed in Chapter 1, of whether we can say we \nare comparing like incomes with like. Nevertheless, the word ‘incentive’ has been used here \nbecause this is the way government often describes its objectives. \n 24 \nself-employed will cover a variety of working patterns with different economic \n29\nconsequences. \n2.12 The research outlined above shows how difficult it is to draw a line between \nthe entrepreneurial self-employed at one end of the entrepreneurial continuum and the \ndependent self-employed at the other. This is so because individuals move along this \ncontinuum and because the relevant characteristics cover a range, so that the overall \npicture is not black and white. In the DTI employment status report, the authors \nsuggest that the key characteristics of ‘genuine self-employment’ are \n30\n• working for a large number of clients and \n• having employees and/or the ability to hire others to work in substitution for \nthemselves. \nThese are good guides if they are present, but their absence does not necessarily mean \nthat a worker is not running a business on his own account, or attempting to do so.  \n2.13 A person starting out at the end closest to dependence may develop his \nbusiness. Indeed, government policy is to promote such growth. An attempt to tailor \ntax policy to the self-employed with the above characteristics could backfire because \nit would not take into account nuances and shades of grey, nor the dynamic nature of \nbusinesses. Thus, limiting a tax incentive to the self-employed with employees could \nencourage the self-employed to take on employees, but only if they had reached the \nstage where this was economically feasible. Such a limitation of relief could also \ninhibit a self-employed person without employees from making the investment needed \nto promote the business and generally could reduce his ability to grow and be \nprofitable. It would not enable the sole service provider to operate on a level playing \nfield with other larger businesses. A worker who was once an employee may continue \nto provide services mainly for his old employer when he first starts up. He may also be \nputting into place a business organisation and beginning to take on work from others \nin a bid to expand his client base, at the same time. It will be difficult to judge at this \nstage whether he will succeed in this endeavour, but if he is not treated for tax \n                                                                                                                                            \n29\n A similar result will ensue if government seeks to favour one legal form over another \nthrough tax reliefs or allowances. The 10 per cent rate of tax for companies introduced in \n1999 is an example of a relief introduced to encourage entrepreneurs using one business \nform. This might attract those whom government does not consider to be ‘genuine \nentrepreneurs’ to incorporate, leading to ‘anti-avoidance legislation’ – see paras 4.81–4.84 \nbelow. \n30\n This statement was based on a quantitative survey that questioned how many \norganisations/agencies the worker had worked for in the last six months, followed up in some \ncases by individual interviews asking ‘how many people do you work for?’. \n 25purposes as running his own business, he may be unable to take the next step towards \n31\nentrepreneurial endeavour. \n2.14 On the other hand, some self-employed may always remain closer to \nemployees economically and have no intention of doing otherwise. Treating these \nworkers differently from employees also appears to create a tax distortion. It is these \nworkers who will often give rise to charges of anomalies and perceived injustice. \nWhilst economists and sociologists can describe a complex scenario in terms of a \ncontinuum, for legal purposes a line must be drawn somewhere and there will always \nbe people close to the borders. Any attempt to deal with anomalies at one border can \nhave an impact further along the continuum and create new anomalies there. It is \nimportant to recognise the needs relating to firms at both ends of the continuum when \ndevising legal tests. \n2.15 Not all self-employed workers choose to be classified as self-employed for tax \nor other purposes. The position is much more complex than this. It may also involve \nchoices by the firms to which services are being provided and industry practice in \ndifferent sectors. In some industries, often where workers are lower paid and \nvulnerable – for example, book publishing, hotel and catering, construction and milk \ndelivery workers – there is empirical evidence that workers may be given little choice \n32\nabout employment status if they want to find work at all. In other industries, where \nworkers are higher paid, the customary mode of organisation may be to outsource \nwork that requires specialist skills that may not be needed in the long term. Examples \n33\nhere are the oil and IT industries. This may suit the workers in some cases but its \norigin may be in the organisation of these industries and their vertical disintegration \n34\nrather than in the tax system. \n2.16 In broad general terms, the higher-paid often will benefit financially from \n35\nclassification as self-employed for tax and National Insurance purposes. The loss of \nemployment protection may not be a major problem for them because they have \n                                                                                                                                            \n31\n It is possible also that he might be spurred on by the tax differences to take a further step to \nindependent activity, but he will only be able to do this if the economic circumstances are \nright – it may not always be a matter of choice. \n32\n Harvey, fn. 21 above (construction industry); C. and J.

There are \nexceptions to this, particularly in the case of older workers who may lose pension \n37\nrights if laid off late in their careers. But the lower-paid are more likely to lose out \nfinancially and in employment protection terms from self-employed classification. \nThe firms being supplied with the services may gain financially, whether the workers \nare lower- or higher-paid. Not only will they save tax and National Insurance \npayments and administration, but they will have greater flexibility in taking on and \nlaying off staff. If others in the industry are using mainly free-lance workers and not \ntreating them as employees, then firms may feel pressure to adopt this strategy \nthemselves in order to remain competitive. Some of the savings may have to be passed \non to workers by way of higher pay, but not all will be, especially where there are total \nsavings of costs for both parties. On the other hand, firms may wish to retain skilled \nworkers by employing them permanently, especially where they have invested in their \ntraining or where the workers have acquired information about the firm that would be \n38\nof value to competitors. \n2.17 Interviews with employers/clients have shown that the single most important \nreason firms give for using self-employed people is the provision of specialist skills. \nIn responses to an Employment Department survey, 60 per cent of employers surveyed \nstated that they used self-employed workers to provide specialist skills, 29 per cent to \nmatch manning levels to peaks in demand, 28 per cent because workers preferred to \nbe self-employed, 6 per cent to reduce non-wage costs such as pensions and sick pay, \nand 3 per cent to avoid responsibility for PAYE and NICs. It is possible that tax and \ncost reasons were under-reported, but even so the difference in these figures is very \n39\nlarge. Whilst tax and other savings are a factor, therefore, there are also strong \ncommercial reasons for the organisation of business using self-employed labour. \n40\n2.18 The DTI employment status report asked respondents whose employment \nstatus was ambiguous (defined as self-employed without employees, those in \ntemporary work and those working under some sort of non-standard working \narrangement) why they worked as they did. Overall, 64 per cent of this group said that \nthis was due to their own preference, but 30 per cent said that it was due to their \nemployer’s or client’s preference or the only basis on which work was available. The \n                                                                                                                                            \n36\n The loss of employment rights (e.g. the right not to be unfairly dismissed) is not trivial, \nhowever, especially now that the compensation limit has been lifted to £50,000 (see \nAppendix to this paper). Contractual rights may, of course, be much higher. \n37\n Women, even higher-paid women, may also prefer employment if maternity leave might \nbecome an issue, and other rights and loss of the opportunity to participate in share option \nand profit schemes might also be a consideration. \n38\n See the scenarios described in Future Unit, Work in the Knowledge-Driven Economy, \n(1999) DTI (hereafter Future Unit). \n39\n A.

The DTI employment \nstatus report does not specify reasons for these preferences, but there may be many \nreasons, in addition to taxation and NICs, for a person to prefer self-employment \ndespite the loss of benefits: for example, flexibility as regards hours worked and the \ntype of work undertaken. \n2.19 Views differ about the structure of work in the future, especially in the light of \ntechnological change. Some believe that self-employment will continue to grow, with \nbusiness networks replacing management hierarchies. Others argue that employment \npatterns have now stabilised and that it will be in the interests of business to capture \nand internalise the new knowledge and technological skills. Based on these different \n41\napproaches in the literature, the DTI Future Unit has devised two scenarios. In the \n42\nfirst, ‘Wired World’, self-employment and portfolio working are common and small \nbusinesses have become the dominant force in the economy. In the second, ‘Built to \nLast’, stable and often large companies seek to capture knowledge to gain a \ncompetitive advantage, by offering comprehensive remuneration packages so that self-\nemployment and temporary contract work are rare. \n2.20 In the light of uncertainty about which of these views of work will be closer to \nreality, the Future Unit recommends that government officials should test the \nrobustness of decisions against both scenarios. It is clearly difficult to tailor a tax \nsystem for both of these very different possibilities, but it seems essential to bear them \nin mind when planning reforms. As we have seen, the problems are not unique to the \nUK and changing work patterns are causing many other countries to examine their tax, \nsocial security and employment law provisions and to introduce special rules for non-\n43\nstandard workers. \n2.21 The current position is that there is a sizeable percentage of the work-force \noperating as self-employed with no employees. Such workers may or may not properly \nbe described as running a business in economic terms, and some of those who start as \nbeing closer to employees may develop a business, whilst others may not. The \ndifferences are multi-factored and not susceptible to a simple test. The size of the \ngroup has increased substantially since 1980 and poses the tax system with issues it \nwas not designed to meet. There is at least a possibility that the number of taxpayers \nfalling within this group will increase in the future, and the robustness of the design of \nthe tax system needs to be measured against this possibility. \n                                                                                                                                            \n41\n Future Unit, fn. 38 above. \n42\n ‘The portfolio is a collection of different bits and pieces for different clients.

It is \noften clear that such workers are employees for tax purposes. What matters for tax is \nthe relationship in existence at the time and not whether there is a mutual obligation \nrelating to provision of work and the undertaking of it in future – a very important \n44\nfactor in employment law cases. In addition, there are special legislative tax \nprovisions, in particular those relating to agency workers, which do not apply to \nemployment protection law. Nevertheless, there are important associated tax and \nNational Insurance contribution problems with short-term and multiple employments \nin a system of cumulative PAYE, which works best where there is stable long-term \nemployment. Thus the increase in portfolio, ‘casual’ and temporary working does \nhave implications for the administration of the tax system. \n2.23 The nature of the ‘flexible work-force’ has been the subject of considerable \nrecent controversy. It has been argued that the work-force has been dividing into two \n45\nsections – the core and the periphery. The core workers have better working \nconditions than the periphery, working under non-standard contracts – that is, \ntemporary, part-time and the ‘dependent self-employed’. There is disagreement as to \n46\nhow far this is the result of deliberate employer strategy, how much a question of \n47\nworker preferences and how much simply a reaction to economic conditions, \nalthough it is clear that non-standard workers are often disadvantaged in terms of \n48\nemployment conditions. \n2.24 The size and growth of the periphery is also at issue, partly due to definitional \nproblems and reliance on self-reporting surveys. Hakim showed that, in 1981, full-\n                                                                                                                                            \n44\n On the mutuality of obligation test, see Chapter 3 below and the DTI employment status \nreport, fn. 23 Introduction above. \n45\n This thesis was originally that of J. Atkinson, ‘Flexibility or fragmentation? The United \nKingdom labour market in the eighties’, (1987) Labour and Society, vol. 12, no. 1, January, \nand see D. Gallie, M. White, Y. Cheung and M. Tomlinson, Restructuring the Employment \nRelationship, (1998) Clarendon Press, Oxford (hereafter Gallie et al.) and the research \ndiscussed there. \n46\n See McGregor and Sproull, fn. 39 above  \n47\n Hakim, fn. 3 above. \n48\n Gallie et al., fn. 45 above, although they point out (in chapter 6) that different employment \nconditions are associated with different types of non-standard work making the \ncore/periphery analysis misleading. For example, part-time workers, in their view, are no \nmore insecure than full-timers, but short-term temporary workers, not surprisingly, feel their \njobs are highly insecure. Non-standard workers will often not benefit from benefits such as \nparticipation in pension or share option schemes and this means that they cannot participate \nin tax reliefs available to others. They may also find it difficult to build up National \nInsurance contribution records to entitle them to receive benefits, even though they do pay \ncontributions when in employment. \n 2949\ntime regular employees made up 70 per cent of those in the work-force. By 1986, \nthis had dropped to 65 per cent, so she identified one-third of the work-force as \n‘flexible’, although there are problems of definition. Figures for 1993, based on the \nGeneral Household Survey and the Labour Force Survey, show around 50 per cent of \nthe population of working age (note the different definition) in full-time employment, \nwith nearly 15 per cent in part-time employment. The remaining members of this \npopulation are in self-employment, temporary employment, government schemes, \n50\nunemployed or inactive within the labour market. The increase in part-time \nemployment is heavily linked to the increasing proportion of women in the work-\n51\nforce. \n52\n2.25 These figures may exaggerate the level of job insecurity in the UK. For the \nmajority (the core), job tenure and security have not changed greatly. The data \nsuggest, however, that for those on the periphery, the labour market is dominated by \n53\npart-time and temporary jobs. While full-time permanent posts for employees have \nalmost certainly not become more unstable, the labour market now contains more \nunstable forms of employment than ever before. For workers falling within the less \nstable, peripheral group, there may be little option of obtaining a full-time job. For \nexample, only 40 per cent of all posts filled by those out of work are full-time and \npermanent, and exit from the ‘flexible’ employment forms usually ends in complete \nexit from the employed labour force. These are the most vulnerable members of the \nwork-force. If their employment status is in doubt for legal and tax purposes, or the \nadministrative systems are not designed to deal with them, they are put into an even \n54\nmore difficult position. \nHomeworkers and teleworkers \n55\n2.26 People working  at home (homeworkers) present a particular challenge in \nterms of worker status classification. Some are classified as employees, some as self-\n                                                                                                                                            \n49\n Hakim, fn. 3 above. \n50\n Gregg and Wadsworth, fn. 4 above. \n51\n Gallie et al., fn. 45 above. \n52\n S.

They often have mixed characteristics. Their home base suggests that they \nwill have at least some expenses that an employee would not normally have, such as \nrent, heating and lighting. Often, but not always, they will provide their own \nequipment. This has clear tax implications. On examination, however, such workers \nare sometimes very dependent on one supplier of work, and the level of control \nexercised over their work may be significant. In relation to employment law, mutual \nobligation to work and provide work may be a difficult issue. \n2.27 As a result of these special problems, specific legislative provisions within \n56\nemployment law have protected homeworkers. These special provisions do not \nextend to tax and National Insurance. For these purposes, as a result of the many \nfactors pointing in different directions, homeworkers are often at the borderline of \n57\nemployee and self-employed. Others are clearly employees, but because they are \nworking in a way not envisaged when the tax rules on expenses, for example, were \n58\nevolved, they are not catered for effectively by the current system. \n2.28 ‘Traditional’ homeworkers, such as workers in the clothing industry and those \nengaged in packaging and routine clerical work, are often extremely vulnerable in that \nthey may be unskilled and/or have little bargaining power. These workers must be \ndistinguished from a new breed of workers working in their own home – the \nteleworkers and IT workers who have been encouraged by the new technology to new \npatterns of working, who may well be higher-earning and have a greater choice about \ntheir working conditions. But the position must not be over-simplified. There are not \njust two forms of homeworking. Work at home can take many forms and cover many \ntypes of activity, from well-paid consultancies through free-lance publishing and \n59\nclerical work to low-paid child-minding and manufacturing and packing. \n2.29 Figures on homeworkers are unclear, not least because of definitional \n60\nproblems. Working from LFS figures, Felstead showed a tripling of homeworkers \nfrom 100,000 in 1981 to 250,000 (plus 55,000 whose second job was homeworking) \nin 1994. He found that four out of every five homeworkers were women. Of \nhomeworkers, 70 per cent of males and 42 per cent of females classified themselves as \n61\nself-employed. There may be serious under-reporting of homeworking, however, \n                                                                                                                                            \n56\n See Chapter 4 below. \n57\n See Chapter 3 below for a case where a homeworker was classified in different ways for \ndifferent legal purposes. \n58\n See para. 2.32 below. \n59\n C.

Only about one-third of these homeworkers were regarded as \n64\nemployees, although many would have preferred this status. Pay was very low. \n2.30 In subsequent work for the Employment Department, Felstead and his \ncolleagues used 1991 Census figures.

Both these surveys involve self-\nreporting but the Census includes people who work in the same grounds and buildings \nas home, such as hotel workers, who would be excluded from the LFS. This may \n67\nexplain the discrepancy. There may be similar under-reporting of certain groups for \nboth surveys. \n2.31 The study of homeworkers by Felstead and his team for the Employment \nDepartment expressly targeted a sample of homeworkers from the manufacturing \nsector and lower-status service sector and so was not representative of homeworkers \n68\nnationally. It also used a narrow definition of homeworkers. Of this sample, 91 per \ncent was female and 54 per cent of ethnic minority origin. Sewing was the most \nprominent form of activity. \n2.32 One-third of this particularly vulnerable group regarded themselves as self-\nemployed and responsible for their own tax and NICs, but 45 per cent of the sample as \na whole had only ever worked for one supplier of work. Fifteen per cent felt unable to \ndescribe their employment status. Nine out of ten of the total sample had no written \ncontract outlining the terms and conditions of their employment. Sixty-eight per cent \npreferred working at home to working in a factory or office, mainly so that they could \nfulfil childcare commitments, but only one-quarter stated that they preferred to be \nself-employed. Only one-third of the self-reporting ‘self-employed’ group claimed \nexpenses against tax, despite the fact that over 70 per cent of the sample as a whole \nsaid they incurred financial costs on lighting and heating. Some also incurred \nexpenses on work materials, purchase of machines, telephone calls and travel. \n                                                                                                                                            \nlabour market segmentation Conference, University of Sienna, July (cited in Stanworth 1996, \nfn. 59 above). \n62\n Felstead et al. 1996, fn. 55 above. \n63\n U.

He \nrecords that figures for 1998 suggest that those partially working from home account \nfor 3.5 per cent of the employed work-force, while those reporting working some time \nat home account for another 21.8 per cent. In total, therefore, almost 28 per cent of the \nUK work-force carry out some of their work at home. Average pay is higher for those \nworking at home than for those working elsewhere, but this overall figure conceals the \nlow pay of manual homeworkers. Homeworking is also increasing elsewhere in \nEurope and in the US, Australia and Canada. \n2.34 It can be concluded that homeworking is increasing. Those working at home \ncan have a great variety of activities and conditions. Amongst the most vulnerable \n‘traditional’ homeworkers, as investigated in Felstead’s team’s 1996 study, there is \nsome uncertainty about employment status and therefore tax and NICs liability. Those \nbeing treated as self-employed may not necessarily understand the implications of this \nand the deductions they may make. Those treated as employees may well incur \nsignificant expenses that they do not, and possibly cannot, deduct. Some are almost \ncertainly treated as self-employed who, on further examination, should be described as \nemployees.  \n2.35 Some groups of those working at home are better paid than traditional \nhomeworkers. There has been recent research on teleworkers, defined as all people \nwho work at home or use their home as a base at least one day a week using both a \ntelephone and a computer. This group clearly overlaps with but is not synonymous \nwith the homeworkers group defined above. The research includes an analysis of LFS \nfigures (1998) and concludes that 5 per cent of the British work-force can be said to \n70\nbe teleworkers on the above definition. \n2.36 Of these teleworkers, 52 per cent are employees and 47 per cent are classified \nas self-employed. A major factor in considering the conditions of these workers is that \nmany work for transnational corporations and will be doing the same work as those \nbased in other countries. If tax or administrative obstacles are met by the \nemployer/clients, it is a relatively easy matter for them to relocate their operations, as \nthe work can be done wherever they can find workers with the required skills. This \ncould lead to a ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of worker protection and of pressure for \n71\nlower taxes and less burdensome regulation of business. On the other hand, there \ncould also be some ‘levelling up’ of conditions for workers due to globalisation of \n                                                                                                                                            \n69\n Felstead and Jewson 1999, fn. 60 above. \n70\n U.

Also, networking between workers in different countries might \nencourage convergence of pay and conditions, rather than reduction of standards for \nall. The outcome will depend on how transferable this business and the workers \ninvolved in it really are, their networking power and the extent to which the EU and \nother international bodies can impose standards. \n2.37 A DTI booklet designed to encourage teleworking in the UK states: \n‘Normally, the distinctions between employee status and self-employment are \nobvious. However, some workers who appear to be self-employed may for tax \npurposes be in an employee relationship with an employer.’ \nThis rather confusing statement is followed up by a reference to the Inland Revenue’s \n72\nbooklet IR56. The DTI booklet acknowledges that the tax implications of \nteleworking differ depending on whether the worker is employed or self-employed, \nbut provides very little advice on this issue other than to suggest that individuals \nconsult an accountant. Development of government policy for this fast-growing sector \nneeds to take into account whether any special allowances or rules may be needed to \nadapt the taxation system to this new way of thinking. \nChapter conclusion \n2.38 The increase in all types of non-standard work poses challenges to the legal \nsystem of classification. Tax concepts of employment and self-employment and the \nconsequences attached to these different types of status were developed for the \nstandard work of the early part of the twentieth century. Most people are still in \nstandard work and this may well continue to be the case. But increasing numbers are \nwholly or partly engaged in variations of this standard pattern.  \n2.39 In a tax context, this has two main consequences. First, the number of workers \nat the borderline of the employed and self-employed classification has increased. This \nputs pressure on the borderline and makes it important that the Revenue authorities \ncan police it adequately. It increases the problems where very different tax \nconsequences flow from classification. It places a heavy weight on this case law \nclassification and on the courts to make it coherent and as far as possible in tune with \nreality, whilst maintaining a degree of certainty. Second, even where classification is \nnot an issue because a non-standard worker is fairly clearly on one side of the line or \nthe other, the rules developed for standard workers may not fit easily with the \nincreasing number of those who do not follow the standard pattern. Cumulative \nPAYE, the expenses rules and NICs record rules are all examples of this problem. \n                                                                                                                                            \n72\n Discussed in Chapter 3 below. \n 34 \nCHAPTER 3: LEGAL CLASSIFICATIONS \nAs stated in the introduction, legal classification of workers must place them \nclearly on one side or the other of the employed/self-employed boundary for the \npurposes of each engagement. This places great strain on decision-making where \ncomplex factual situations are concerned. This chapter analyses the case law on \nworker status, with particular emphasis on income tax and National Insurance. \nVAT is also referred to. A comparison is made between the approach of the \ncourts in tax and in employment law cases. We note that different tribunals, \nostensibly applying the same case law, may come to different conclusions, in part \ndue to the different objectives of the legislation they are considering and the \ndifferent contexts in which they are considering the cases. \nThe great weight placed on the facts of each case and the absence of a definitive \nlist of factors or weighting of those factors is discussed. If workers are seen as \nstretching across a continuous spectrum, as described in the introduction and \nChapter 2, then this fact-based jurisprudence accords with reality and gives the \ncourts the best chance of adapting the law to changing work patterns. It also \nprevents the definition of an employee or self-employed person from becoming \nformulaic, which could result in manipulation. The case law shows the flexibility \nneeded to meet changing working patterns. \nAt the same time, the law needs to provide guidance and certainty. The \nunwillingness of the courts to formulate status decisions as questions of law \nmakes the attainment of certainty difficult and may place strain on the Inland \nRevenue, business and workers alike. The courts have the scope to lay down a \nlegal framework for guidance and have sometimes, but not always, been \nprepared to do so. Where different tribunals, ostensibly applying the same test, \ncome to different decisions on the same facts, this is especially confusing. It is \nmisleading to suggest that the courts are applying identical tests where this is not \nso. It would be preferable for the differences to be clearly stated, and judicial \nclarification on this would be welcome. Legislative differences may also make \nthis clearer. These are discussed in Chapter 4 below. \nIntroduction \n3.1 The meaning of the terms ‘employee’ and ‘self-employed’ has been evolved \nthrough case law. There is no general statutory definition of these terms, but there are \nstatutory definitions of ‘worker’ and statutorily extended definitions of ‘employee’ \nand related concepts in some employment law, tax and National Insurance legislation. \nSome legislative provisions treat non-employees as if they were employees and vice \nversa for some purposes (see Chapter 4 below). The starting-point, though, even in \nmany of the statutory definitions, takes the user back to case law by way of reference \nto a ‘contract of employment’ or ‘contract of service’. \n 35Law and fact \n3.2 One major difficulty is the extent to which classification under the case law is \na question of fact, an issue that has been the subject of some considerable discussion \n1\nin the cases and literature. The emphasis in the status cases on the facts makes worker \nstatus often an issue for the fact-finding tribunal at first instance and not for appeal. \nOnly questions of law can be appealed to a higher court. It is sometimes said that the \nstatus of the worker is a question of fact and sometimes that it is a question of mixed \n2\nlaw and fact. There are primary facts and inferences to be drawn from them, but the \ninferences are also questions of fact, although they can be overturned by an appellate \n3\ncourt if they are insupportable on the basis of the primary facts found by the tribunal. \nAn alternative formulation, which comes to much the same result in practice, is that \nthe badges of the worker’s status are a question of law, but that the relative weight to \n4\nbe afforded to those badges in a particular case is a question of fact.  \n3.3 As discussed further below, it is clear from the status cases in all areas of law \nthat there is no conclusive list of factors to be taken into account and that the \n5\nweighting of factors in one case may be different from that in others. Equally, it is \naccepted that the parties may not label their relationship in the way they choose. The \ntrue legal relationship between the parties depends upon all the facts and not the label \nor description the parties may elect for, although the label may be relevant evidence of \n6\nintention in some circumstances. \n3.4 This approach to the facts inevitably limits the uniformity to be found in this \narea. Were the courts, particularly the higher courts, to wish to impose a more rigid set \nof criteria and relative weightings, there is no doubt that they could choose to do so by \n7\nreasserting the extent to which this is a question of law. As Scrutton LJ stated in \nCurrie v CIR: \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n The leading case is Edwards v Bairstow and Harrison [1955] 3 All ER 48. See G. Pitt, \n‘Law fact and casual workers’, (1985) 101 Law Quarterly Review 217; T. Endicott, \n‘Questions of law’, (1998) 114 Law Quarterly Review 292; the Rt Hon. Sir John Laws, ‘Law \nand fact’, [1999] British Tax Review 159 (hereafter Laws).  \n2\n Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung [1990] 2 AC 374 (PC). \n3\n Per Lord Radcliffe in Edwards v Bairstow and Harrison, fn. 1 above; see also Lord \nBrightman in Furniss v Dawson [1984] STC at 167. \n4\n Barnett v Brabyn [1996] STC 716. \n5\n Market Investigations Ltd v The Minister of Social Security [1969] 2 Q.B. 173. \n6\n Young & Woods Ltd v West [1980] IRLR 201 CA. \n7\n See Fitzpatrick v IRC (No 2) [1994] STC 237, where two of their Lordships would have \nbeen content to allow different bodies of Commissioners to come to different decisions on \ndifferent facts but Lord Templeman thought this was unacceptable. In practice, a strong lead \nwas given; this point is discussed in J. Tiley and D. Collison, UK Tax Guide 2000–2001, \n(2000) Butterworths, London (hereafter Tiley and Collison) at para. 1.45. \n 36 \n‘… There has been a very strong tendency, arising from the infirmities of human \nnature, in a judge to say, if he agrees with the decision of the Commissioners, that the \nquestion is one of fact and if he disagrees with them that it is one of law, in order that \n8\nhe may express his own opinion the opposite way.’ \nMore recently, the Rt Hon. Sir John Laws has stated extra-judicially that the boundary \nbetween law and fact is not fixed. ‘It depends on what the higher courts think ought to \nbe a matter of law: or, more pointedly, what they think should be subject to judicial \n9\ncontrol.’ \n3.5 It seems, therefore, that the courts have preferred to leave this question of \nstatus flexible as a mixed question of law and fact. The courts are concerned, first, that \nthis might not be appropriate because all the surrounding facts really are of great \nimportance in employment status cases and, second, that they might be crushed by the \n10\nweight of appeals if all borderline cases were to be considered questions of law. \nLeaving some issues within the domain of fact has the usual advantages and \ndisadvantages of flexibility: it prevents the manipulation that can result from more \nrigid criteria and so can lead to justice in individual cases, but it also results in \nuncertainty.  \n3.6 The best option seems to be a midway approach that provides a framework of \nbadges or factors. Though it may not be possible or desirable to provide clear \nweightings or a distinct hierarchy of such factors, the courts can give valuable \nguidance and be prepared to intervene when the cases arising from the lower courts \nindicate that governing principles are needed. Lord Radcliffe made this point in \nrelation to the cases on trading in 1955, stating: \n‘I think it possible that the English courts have been led to be rather over-ready to treat \nthese questions as “pure questions of fact” … If so, I would say, with very great \n11\nrespect, that I think it a pity that such a tendency should persist.’ \nIt will be seen in this chapter that some such guidance can be derived from the status \ncases and, to this extent, it can be said that there are some questions of law in this \narea. \nDifferent areas of law – different factors \n3.7 In theory, the different areas of law, in which the distinction between the \nemployed and self-employed is of relevance, adopt the same or similar tests, derived \nfrom the same case law. In practice, the different tribunals that decide the cases and \n                                                                                                                                            \n8\n Currie v CIR [1921] 2KB 332 at p. 339, cited in Endicott, fn. 1 above. \n9\n Laws, fn. 1 above. \n10\n Per Lord Griffiths in Lee Ting Sang, fn. 2 above. \n11\n Edwards v Bairstow and Harrison, fn. 1 above, at p. 59. \n 37the different contexts in which they are heard have led to different emphases in the \ndecided cases. Some factors of importance in one area are of much less importance in \nanother. For example, mutuality of obligation is important to establishing employment \nstatus under employment law, where the ongoing relationship is significant, but much \nless so in tax law, where what is significant is usually the relationship at a specific \ntime. \n3.8 As discussed in Chapter 5 below, there are different appeal regimes in \ndifferent areas of law. Tax and NICs appeals systems have differed in the past but, \nsince April 1999, have been brought together under the Tax Appeal Commissioners, \n12\nas recommended previously by the TLRC. This is welcome, but other tribunals will \nstill be involved in deciding status, notably employment tribunals. In all cases, appeals \nto the higher courts are on a point of law only. This patchwork quilt of appeals \nsystems, coupled with the limited scope for intervention and guidance by the higher \ncourts due to the emphasis on fact, goes a considerable way to explain the lack of \nconsistency in the cases. The interaction of these systems can be the source of some \nconfusion and anxiety to workers and business owners alike. \nOther jurisdictions \n3.9 A survey of overseas jurisdictions is outside the scope of this paper, but some \npoints are worth highlighting, drawn from ongoing TLRC research. \n3.10 The fundamental problems of classification of workers for tax, social security \nand employment purposes experienced in the UK are similar to those in all other \njurisdictions we have examined, common law and civil and regardless of the absence \nof a schedular tax system in other jurisdictions. The classification problem is less \nmarked in some countries than others, but this is because there are fewer differences \nbetween the two groups of workers so that classification is less important. So, for \nexample, not all countries treat expenses of employees differently from those of the \nself-employed, but most countries seem to have a classification problem as regards \nsocial security contributions. Withholding taxes also create a need for classification, \n13\nalthough this may be less acute where all taxpayers fill in a tax return and the \nwithholding system is not cumulative. \n3.11 A number of jurisdictions have attempted statutory intervention but this has \nnot been easy either to design or to operate. Most statutory approaches either try an \n‘integrationist’ approach, whereby the meaning of ‘employee’ has been extended, or \nadopt a ‘special cases’ approach, whereby certain types of workers are specifically \nprotected or targeted irrespective of their status.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n12\n TLRC, National Insurance Contributions Disputes, (1998) Institute for Fiscal Studies, \nLondon. \n13\n Or a tax return is filled in on their behalf, in the case of countries with joint assessment of \nmarried couples. \n 38 \n3.12 Some jurisdictions have categories of persons who are treated as employees \nfor tax and/or social security purposes because they are considered to be the ‘false \nself-employed’. In Germany, for social security purposes, for example, a person is \nclassed as an employee if any three of the following five conditions are fulfilled: \n• The person does not employ other workers at wages above DEM 630 per month \n(including family members). \n• The person depends strongly upon one employer over a long time. \n• The person is employed with tasks for which his employer or a comparable \nemployer usually employs dependent workers. \n• The person does not act as an entrepreneur. \n• The person is employed with the same tasks by the same employer for whom he or \n14\nshe previously worked as an employee. \n3.13 Although at first it might seem helpful to have this statutory intervention, \ncreating some objective tests, some of the tests continue to be subjective and would \nseem difficult to apply, such as whether the person acts as an entrepreneur. \n3.14 Australia has gone much further. From having a system of PAYE that used to \nrequire withholding from labour-only suppliers as well as employees, it has now \n15\nmoved to a new integrated pay-as-you-go system (PAYG). Under this scheme, \nemployees are subject to withholding. In addition, broadly, this requires businesses in \nreceipt of goods or labour to withhold 48.5 per cent from payments to any supplier of \ngoods or services not able to quote an Australian Business Number (ABN). There is \nno entitlement to an ABN unless the supplier is carrying on an enterprise. ‘Enterprise’ \nis defined to include a business or trade with an expectation of profit. This means that \nsome casual labour-only workers will be covered by the scheme, but the issue of \nwhether they are carrying on a business is not escaped. Where labour-hire firms are \nused as intermediaries, they, not the client, will be responsible for the deduction. \nUnder this scheme, though it is broad and inclusive, it will still be necessary to \nclassify employees, for whom withholding will be at a different rate, and enterprises \nentitled to an ABN. \n3.15 Complex multi-factorial tests of employment status, like those in the UK, \ncontinue to be necessary in Australia and in most other common law countries as their \nbasic starting-point. For example, the revenue authorities in Australia, the US and \nCanada all issue detailed guidance, which, despite differences in style, are remarkably \n                                                                                                                                            \n14\n Regelungen gegen Sceinselbstandigkeit 1998, as amended by Gesetz zur Forderung der \nSelbtstandigkeit 1999, cited in OECD, Employment Outlook, 2000. \n15\n New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No.1) 1999; Australian Tax Office, \nGuide to Pay As You Go for Business – www.ato.gov.au. \n 39similar. Starting from the cases on defining independent contractors, or contracts for \nservices as opposed to contracts of service, they contain long lists of factors and are \n16\nunable to give conclusive advice since all depends on the facts of the case. In the US, \nthe system is based on a 20-factor test derived from case law but contained in a \n17\nRevenue Ruling. Although this is a little more formal than the application of case \nlaw in the UK, the IRS still points out in its guidance that the 20-factor test is ‘an \nanalytical tool and not the legal tool used for determining worker status’. The key \nissues examined in the US are legal control, financial control and behavioural control. \nThe Canadian guidance lists the four key factors as: control, ownership of tools, \n18\nchance of profit/risk and integration. Once again, it is explicit that the guidance is \nmerely a tool: a system of formal rulings is available. \n3.16 In the US, there is dissatisfaction with the uncertainty surrounding the 20-\nfactor test and there have been various attempts to introduce legislation to define the \ntests better. For example, the proposed Independent Contractor Clarification Act of \n19\n1999 would have reduced the 20-factor test to a three-point test. One of these three \ntests would have been whether the individual encounters entrepreneurial risk. None of \nthese attempts at statutory definition has been enacted and most sound little better \nthan the 20-point test, since they use identical concepts. Complaints from small \nbusiness about the complexity of the existing test led to the enactment of the so-called \n‘section 530 safe harbor’ in the 1978 Tax Bill. This was intended as a temporary \nsolution but was permanently extended in 1982 when nothing better could be devised. \nIt provides relief from past and prospective payments to employers who had a \nreasonable basis for not treating the worker as an employee. This may consist of \nreasonable reliance on, for example, a prior IRS audit, a private letter ruling from the \nIRS, a long-standing industry practice, a court decision, advice from a lawyer or \naccountant, or any other reasonable basis. Employers must also be able to show \nreporting consistency and substantive consistency (similarly situated workers must all \nhave been treated in the same way). Various settlements are available short of \n20\ncomplete relief. \n3.17 It is not easy to devise a test that is more straightforward than that in the case \nlaw but that nevertheless retains the flexibility to prevent manipulation and to cover a \ngreat variety of situations. Normally, concepts taken from the case law are \nincorporated into the statutory statements. ‘Safe harbours’ are helpful, but cannot \n                                                                                                                                            \n16\n Australian Draft Taxation Ruling TR2000/D2; Canada Customs and Revenue Agency \nRC4110; IRS Worker Classification Training Guidelines: Employee or Independent \nContractor (October 1996). \n17\n USA Rev.

We therefore turn to an examination of the case law in the \nUK. \nClassification case law and income tax  \n3.18 Under UK income tax law, employees are taxed under Schedule E and the \n21\nself-employed under Schedule D, Cases I and II. One person may be both an \nemployee and self-employed for tax purposes in relation to different engagements. \nThere are important differences in the rules and methods applicable to calculation of \nthe taxable income or profits under these different Schedules and to collection of these \ntaxes. It suffices for present purposes to state that the differences can be of \nsignificance in some circumstances, making classification for this purpose a matter of \npotential importance for workers and for those to whom they supply their services \nalike. A primary difference of great importance to classification is the UK’s PAYE \n22\nsystem of cumulative deduction of tax at source from employment income. It should \nbe noted that intermediate classifications are possible and do exist. The case law test \nof employment status has come under the spotlight recently with the introduction of \n23\ncontroversial personal service intermediaries legislation, which relies upon this test. \n3.19 The Inland Revenue has recently published extensive guidance to \nclassification in its Employment Status Manual (ESM), available on the Inland \nRevenue’s website. In most areas, it seems to reflect the case law in an accurate way, \nthough some aspects where this is not so are referred to below. It contains general \nguidance followed by more detailed guidance. The basic guidance lists and deals with \nthe following factors: control, personal service, provision of equipment, financial risk, \nbasis of payment, mutuality of obligation, holiday pay, maternity pay, sick pay and \npension rights, part and parcel of the organisation, right of dismissal, opportunity to \nprofit from sound management, personal factors, length of engagement and intention \nof the parties. All these are said to be relevant to the basic question of whether the \nworker is ‘in business on his own account’. Much the same list, with some additions, \nis then reviewed in more detail in a section aimed at Status Inspectors and other \nspecialists. \n3.20 The length and complexity of the manual raises questions about the nature of \nthe test. More compact guidance is available in leaflet form (IR56), but this is too \nbrief to be really useful in many borderline cases. Guidance of a meaningful, but more \nmanageable, length, with examples, has been published for those providing personal \n24\nservices through intermediaries (the ‘IR35 guidance’). Although expressed to be for \n                                                                                                                                            \n21\n Sections 18 and 19 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988; for further \ndetails, see the Appendix to this paper. \n22\n For some more detail on these differences, see the Appendix to this paper. \n23\n For this and other special cases, see Chapter 4. \n24\n Published in Inland Revenue 45 Tax Bulletin February 2000 and also on the Inland \nRevenue’s website. \n 41this particular group, there is no reason why it should not be of value to those engaged \ndirectly by a client and wanting to define their status. \nEarly history  \n3.21 Tax under Schedule E is charged in respect of any office or employment on \n25\nemoluments therefrom. Schedule E covered only public offices and public \nemployments until 1922, when all other employments were moved from Schedule D \n26\nto Schedule E. It was at this stage that the rules for employees and the self-employed \nbegan to diverge. As Monroe has described, this does not seem to have been very \n27\nclearly thought through at the time. As a result of this history, influenced by the \nconcept of the office (previously Schedule E’s primary subject matter), the early cases \non the meaning of employment, notably Davies v Braithwaite, treated the concept of \n28\nemployment as ‘analogous to an office’. Rowlatt J said that, in putting employment \ninto Schedule E alongside offices, the legislature had in mind employments that were \nsomething like offices, for which he used the expression ‘posts’. In the Braithwaite \ncase, where an actress was held to be self-employed, the fact that she had a series of \nengagements with a separate contract for each was considered significant. The judge \nconsidered her position as a whole and decided that she did not have a post that she \nstayed in but engagements entered into in the course of a profession.  \nContract for services or contract of service? \n3.22 Later decisions injected a more modern approach, adopted from cases in other \nareas of law, and moved away from the concept of the post. These cases use the \nterminology of a contract for services (self-employment) or a contract of service \n(employment). The adoption of this terminology was an early sign of the willingness \n29\nof the courts to be creative and flexible in their attitude to status. The contract of \n30\nservice test was firmly introduced into tax law in Fall v Hitchen, a case concerning a \nballet dancer working at Sadler’s Wells. There, the previous case of Market \n31\nInvestigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security was heavily relied upon in deciding \nthat the ballet dancer was an employee. Market Investigations was a decision on the \nNational Insurance Act 1965. This Act expressly defined employment as being ‘under \n                                                                                                                                            \n25\n Section 19 ICTA 1988. \n26\n H. Monroe, Intolerable Inquisition? Reflections on the Law of Tax, (1981) Stevens & Sons, \nLondon, at pp. 25–30. \n27\n Monroe, fn. 26 above, at p. 30 explains how this move led to the current expenses rules, \noutlined in the Appendix to this paper. \n28\n Davies v Braithwaite [1931] 2 KB 628. \n29\n See S. Deakin, ‘The evolution of the contract of employment, 1900–1950: the influence of \nthe welfare state’, (1998) in N. Whiteside and R. Salais (eds), Governance, Industry and \nLabour Markets in Britain and France, Routledge, London. \n30\n Fall v Hitchen [1973] 1 WLR 287. \n31\n [1969] 2 Q.B. 173.  \n 42 \na contract of service’. Pennycuick VC, in Fall v Hitchen, was clear, however, that \n‘contract of service’ was also coterminous with the expression ‘employment’ in \nSchedule E of the Taxes Act, even though the tax legislation did not expressly refer to \na ‘contract of service’. \n3.23 Pennycuick VC was of the view that the question whether a contract is one for \nservices or a contract of service ‘is for all practical purposes purely one of law’. He \nsaw the question as being one of construction of the written contract before him and \n32\nthe proper construction of document normally is a question of law. This narrow \napproach contrasted with the Davies v Braithwaite approach of looking at the \n33\nengagement in the context of other engagements. It moved away from the sense of \npermanence inherent in the Davies v Braithwaite decision and meant that a series of \nshort-term engagements would amount to employments more often than previously. \n‘Control’ gives way to ‘economic reality test’ \n3.24 In  Fall v Hitchen, Pennycuick VC relied upon the analysis of Cooke J in \nMarket Investigations, which reviewed previous decisions on the distinction between \na contract of service and a contract for services from various areas of law, both in the \n34\nUK and elsewhere. Early decisions had placed great weight on control by the \n35\n‘master’ over what was to be done and how it was to be done. Later, it became clear \nthat there may be an employment even where the employee has a particular skill or \n36\nexperience and so will not be told how to do the work. Examples often given are \nthose of employed brain surgeons or masters of ships. They are the experts and will \noperate or navigate as they see fit, but they are still clearly employees. On the other \nhand, there may be cases where the engager reserves control over how the work is to \n37\nbe done but the contract is not a contract of service. For example, a window cleaner \n                                                                                                                                            \n32\n See the comments of Lord Hoffmann in Carmichael v National Power plc (HL) [1999] 4 \nAll ER 897, discussed further below. \n33\n In fact, in Fall v Hitchen, there were no other engagements and the taxpayer required \npermission to take on work for others, but the Commissioners had found as a fact that \nSadler’s Wells encouraged artistes to take other engagements and that he had tried to do so \nunsuccessfully. In the view of the judge, though, what mattered was not whether the taxpayer \nhad one engagement or a series of engagements. He said: ‘The fact that an actor normally \nundertakes a succession of engagements in the course of carrying on that profession in no \nway involves the result that if an actor enters an acting employment in the nature of a post, \nthen he is not assessable under Schedule E in respect of the income arising from that \nemployment’. \n34\n For example, Whittaker v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance [1967] 1 Q.B. 156; \nReady Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \n[1969] 1 All ER 433; U.S. v Silk (1946) 331 U.S. 704. \n35\n For example, Collins v Hertfordshire County Council [1947] K.B. 598. \n36\n Morren v Swinton and Pendlebury Borough Council [1965] 2 All ER 349. \n37\n Queensland Stations Pty. Ltd v Federal Comr. of Taxation (1945) 70 C.L.R.539. \n 43or interior designer may be subject to stringent controls and restrictions but still be \nclearly self-employed. \n3.25 Cooke J in Market Investigations therefore rejected control as a decisive test. \nHe said that it might still be a factor pointing towards employment but it cannot be the \n38\nsole determining factor. He went on to decide, drawing on North American cases, \nthat the fundamental test is ‘Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these \nservices performing them as a person in business on his own account?’. This is known \nas the economic reality test. This rejection of the control test was another indication \nof the potential of the courts to develop the concept of employment to meet changing \nconditions. \nIndependence from paymaster \n3.26 The test of whether the taxpayer is in business on his own account must be \nconsidered as part of a wider economic reality. This must also examine the question of \n39\nintegration of the taxpayer into his paymaster’s business. In Hall v Lorimer, a free-\nlance vision mixer provided services to a number of production companies under very \nshort-term contracts. The Special Commissioner found that the taxpayer was in \nbusiness on his own account. The Inland Revenue appealed, contending that this was \nnot the case, based on the following facts: the production company controlled the \ntime, place and duration of any given engagement; the taxpayer provided no \nequipment; he hired no staff; he ran no financial risk save those of bad debts and \nbeing unable to find work; he had no responsibility for investment in or management \nof the work of programme-making; and he had no opportunity of profiting from the \nmanner in which he carried out individual assignments. \n3.27 The decision of the Special Commissioner, that the taxpayer was self-\nemployed, was upheld by Mummery J and also in the Court of Appeal, which treated \n40\nthe question as one of mixed law and fact. In the Court of Appeal, however, Nolan \nLJ commented that whether the individual is in business on his own account, though \noften helpful, may be of little assistance in the case of one carrying on a profession or \nvocation. Nolan LJ rejected a distinction that Counsel for the Crown had sought to \nmake between those selling the product of their labour (self-employed) and those \nselling their skill or labour itself (employees). This distinction would make it unlikely \nthat a professional person would often be treated as self-employed. As Nolan LJ \nstated, ‘a self-employed author working from home or an actor or singer may earn his \nliving without any of the normal trappings of a business’. Thus the fact that the \ntaxpayer in this case provided little or no equipment of his own did not defeat his \nclaim to be self-employed for tax purposes. This is a very important decision for \nservice providers and the case will no doubt be relied upon heavily by taxpayers \n                                                                                                                                            \n38\n Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd v Montreal and A.G. for Canada [1947] 1 D.L.R. 161. \n39\n [1994] STC 23. \n40\n Hall v Lorimer [1994] STC 23 at p. 26. \n 44 \nclaiming that the personal service intermediaries legislation does not apply to them. \nThe guidance provided by Nolan LJ here is of the type that may help to provide a \nframework without being too rigid. Whether it is referred to as a point of law or a \n‘badge’ or a factor, it is clear that Commissioners deciding that a person was an \nemployee purely because he had no equipment of his own could be reversed by a \n41\nhigher court. \n3.28 For this type of case, Nolan LJ preferred what he called the ‘traditional \ncontrast between a servant and an independent contractor’. He considered the extent \nto which the taxpayer was dependent on or independent of a particular paymaster. \nThis has resonances with the concept of integration into the business, discussed in \nChapter 2. It was significant that in this case the taxpayer could and did send \nsubstitute workers when he was double-booked and that he worked for 20 or more \nproduction companies. In some senses, this was a return to the contextual approach in \n42\nDavies v Braithwaite. The Court looked at the taxpayer’s situation as a whole. This \nis of vital importance to casual workers providing services for a number of clients. \nThe Inland Revenue has now accepted, in its IR35 guidance and in its general \nguidance on classification in the ESM, that it is necessary to look at the personal \ncircumstances of the taxpayer as well as the particular contract in question. \n3.29 In this case, Mr Lorimer risked bad debts and outstanding invoices and \nincurred considerable expenditures at a level that the Court of Appeal considered \nwould not normally be associated with employment. There is a fine line here, though, \nbetween a self-employed person who takes on these risks and a casual employee who \n43\nalso risks being out of work and losing pay through unemployment and bad health. \nAll employees also risk failure by their employers to pay their wages, due to \ninsolvency. The most outstanding feature of this case was, though, the number of \nclients Mr Lorimer served. This decision therefore seems to be very much in \naccordance with a test of ‘economic reality’, although a test based on non-integration \nwith the businesses supplied rather than the taxpayer having the trappings of business \nhimself.  \n44\n3.30 At first instance in Hall v Lorimer, great reliance was placed on an \n45\nemployment law decision of the Court of Appeal, O’Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc, in \nsupport of the proposition that a person who is supplying only his own services can be \n                                                                                                                                            \n41\n See para. 3.47 below for a discussion of the Inland Revenue’s use of this ‘badge’. \n42\n C. Whitehouse, Revenue Law Principles and Practice, 18th edition, (2000) Butterworths \nTolley, London (hereafter Whitehouse), at para. 5.22. \n43\n In Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung, fn. 2 above, cited with approval in Hall v Lorimer, it \nwas held by the Privy Council that a casual worker on a building site was an employee for the \npurpose of employee compensation for injury despite the fact that he risked being out of \nwork. Although this was not a tax case, its applicability to tax cases was not disputed in Hall \nv Lorimer. \n44\n [1992] STC 599. \n45\n [1984] QB 90. \n 45self-employed. In O’Kelly, however, the Court of Appeal had expressly ignored the \ntax and National Insurance position of the employees concerned. In the Court of \nAppeal in Hall v Lorimer, it was not necessary for Nolan LJ to comment on the \nrelevance of O’Kelly, since he considered the other authorities cited were sufficient to \nsupport the Court’s decision. This leaves the significance of O’Kelly for tax cases in \n46\nsome doubt. \n3.31 Counsel for the Inland Revenue in Hall v Lorimer expressed concern in \nargument that the effect of a decision in favour of the taxpayer would be to erode the \nscope of Schedule E in the case of casual employments. The number of paymasters \nserved, however, did seem to differentiate Mr Lorimer from other casual employees, \nalthough at what number the line should be drawn is difficult to say and does not seem \nto be susceptible to a formula. Putting a number on this test would inevitably be an \narbitrary exercise and the test would be relatively simple to manipulate. \nWeighing all the factors and the intention of the parties \n3.32 These cases give some level of guidance and establish some issues that can be \nstated to be questions of law, but much is left to be decided as a question of fact. The \nfactors to be considered can be derived from the cases and listed, as the Inland \nRevenue has done in the ESM cited above. This is also done in many of the textbooks \nand it gives a series of factors somewhat similar to the US’s 20-factor test and lends a \nsense of order and balance to the exercise. This can be spurious, however. A factor \nthat is important in one case can be irrelevant in another. Care must be taken not to \n47\nimply that there are relative weightings to these factors that apply in each case. \n48\n3.33 Lightman J in Barnett v Brabyn described the factors that are relevant to \ndeciding employment status as ‘badges of potential significance’. He accepted that \nthere were questions of law involved in deciding on status. The following are \nstatements of law, for example: that a person who merely renders his services may \n49\nnevertheless be self-employed, that it is a badge of a contract of service that there is \nconferred a first, and a fortiori an exclusive, call upon the services of the individual \n                                                                                                                                            \n46\n Discussed further later in this chapter. \n47\n In her recent book on personal service intermediaries, Redston divides status tests into \nfundamental status tests, important status tests and minor status tests. Whilst apparently \nhelpful, this approach could mislead since, under current law, it is the whole picture that must \nbe looked at and an unduly scientific explanation might be incorrect on the facts of a \nparticular case. Her criticism of the Inland Revenue for not giving guidance on the hierarchy \nof the tests, therefore, seems misplaced, even though it would be useful if such a clear \nhierarchy as she suggests were to exist – A. Redston, IR35: Personal Service Companies, \n(2000) abg, London (hereafter Redston), ch. 6. \n48\n Fn. 4 above, at p. 724. \n49\n Hall v Lorimer, fn. 39 above; O’Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc, fn. 44 above. This is \nobviously a point of great significance in the light of the legislation on personal service \ncompanies discussed in Chapter 4 below. \n 46 \n50 51\nconcerned and that weight can be given to the parties’ intentions. Having said this, \nhowever, he explained that these badges may carry greater or lesser weight depending \nupon the context of the case. On the very unusual facts before him, factors that would \nnormally indicate employment did not carry much weight. \n3.34 Mr Justice Lightman considered that ‘factors relevant in one situation may be \nirrelevant or of no weight in another’. Further, he stated that the labels the parties \ndecide to give the relationship may or may not be relevant. Such a label must be \ndisregarded if inconsistent with the effect of the contract as a whole, but can be \n52\ndecisive where the terms of the contract are consistent with either relationship. \n3.35 Accurate as Mr Justice Lightman’s summary of the position appears to be, it is \nof very little use in giving day-to-day guidance to those on the ground, who must \napply the law and make decisions based upon it: business owners, workers, advisers \nand Inland Revenue officials. Business owners and workers can be forgiven for \nfeeling confused and finding this a costly and exasperating aspect of the tax system if \nthey are operating in a non-standard situation that is at the status borderline. \n53\n3.36 In  McManus v Griffiths, Lightman J warned that taxpayers should be wary \nabout making informal agreements without appropriate professional advice. In this \ncase, an employed golf club stewardess was required by her contract, in addition to \nher other duties, to provide a catering service for the club. She was assessed on the \ncatering profits under Schedule D Case I on the basis that she was running a business \non her own account. In the circumstances of that case, Lightman J considered that the \ntaxpayer’s status was entirely a question of proper construction of the contractual \ndocuments ‘viewed in the matrix of facts in which they were signed’ and was \ntherefore a question of law. The taxpayer had control of the menu and prices and a \nfree hand in the employment of staff, and so it was held that the catering service she \nprovided was a business and not part of her employment. \n3.37 The facts of this case were unusual, but the parties were not particularly \nsophisticated and there is no evidence in the case that this was a tax avoidance \nexercise. The club secretary drew up the documents and does not appear to have \nconsidered their tax implications. Although the judge commented that the club \nsecretary should have sought professional advice, there is a problem in knowing when \nsuch advice is needed. Moreover, it is questionable whether taxpayers and business \n                                                                                                                                            \n50\n Fall v Hitchen, fn. 30 above. \n51\n Massey v Crown Life Insurance Co [1978] 2 All ER 576. \n52\n In this, the judge followed with approval an employment law case, Massey v Crown Life \nInsurance Co, fn. 51 above, discussed further below. Contrast the comment of the New \nZealand Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express (New Zealand) Ltd v Cunningham \n[1993] 3 NZLR 681 – ‘there are many reasons why both employer and contractor prefer the \nindependent contractor arrangement. They should be free to exercise their choice without \npaternalistic intervention by the Courts.’ \n53\n [1997] STC 1089. \n 47owners should need to seek professional advice in their everyday affairs in this way. If \nthey do seek such advice, can certainty be achieved? On the same judge’s own \nadmission in Barnett v Brabyn, just one year before, factors of importance in one case \nwill be insignificant in another. This will hardly give even experienced practitioners \nconfidence that they can give accurate advice in borderline cases. \n3.38 It is unfortunate that the facts of Barnett v Brabyn were quite so unusual. \nLightman J’s listing of the factors that might be seen as questions of law did, in fact, \ngive guidance on what should be considered and what might be discounted, even \nthough no weightings could be attached. \nInland Revenue guidance \n3.39 The Inland Revenue has issued the various forms of guidance described above: \n54\nIR56, the IR35 guidelines and the ESM. In addition, there is a booklet (IR175) \nentitled ‘Supplying services through a limited company or partnership’, and more \nextensive guidelines are also contained in special material for the construction \n55\nindustry. \nIR56 \n3.40 IR56, the basic leaflet prepared for taxpayers, was updated in April 1999 and \nis now available on the Inland Revenue’s website. In the Inland Revenue’s own \nlistings of leaflets, it is stated of IR56 that ‘This can help you decide whether or not \nyou are employed or self-employed, an area that causes a lot of confusion’. IR56 \nwould be unlikely to help much with that confusion in anything other than a \nreasonably clear case. It is arguable, moreover, that it does not wholly reflect the Hall \n56\nv Lorimer decision. \n3.41 IR56 lists questions to be applied to each separate job and states: ‘You’ll need \nto look at your job as a whole’, rather than suggesting that one needs to look at each \njob in the context of all activities of the taxpayer. It does state at a later point: \n‘Where, however, you provide services to many different persons and do not work \nregularly for one person to the exclusion of others, this may be relevant to the decision \nwhether your work for each is as an employee, or a self employed person.’  \n3.42 This is not given prominence by placing it within the key questions, however. \nThis contrasts with the layout of IR175, published in 2000, which asks similar \nquestions to those in IR56, but follows them up immediately with the comment that \n                                                                                                                                            \n54\n Paras 3.19 and 3.20 above. \n55\n IR148/CA69, ‘Are your workers employed or self-employed?’, was produced for the \nconstruction industry in 1995. See also Inland Revenue 28 Tax Bulletin April 1997, p. 405. \n56\n See Whitehouse, fn. 42 above, at para. 5.22; Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 above, at para. 51.03. \n 48 \nthe number of clients overall may be relevant. In IR56 and IR175, there is still a great \nemphasis on providing tools and risking one’s own money ‘in the business’ – an \nemphasis which may now be misleading.  \n3.43 IR56 is inadequate for those at the borderline – the very people who \nparticularly need assistance. Now that more detailed and, normally, more accurate \nguidance has been provided in the IR35 guidelines and the ESM, it would be helpful if \nIR56 could be revised and updated to take Hall v Lorimer into account more fully and \nclearly. Given the effort being made to assist those with personal service \nintermediaries, a rather more detailed leaflet for general guidance would also be \ndesirable.  \n3.44 The more detailed guidance now available is helpful and welcome. All such \nguidance is problematic also, however. If it is too brief, like IR56, it risks being of \nlittle use in the difficult cases where it is most needed. If it is too detailed, it may \nbecome off-putting and burdensome to the people for whom it is intended. The ESM \nis very long and detailed. It is accessible on the Inland Revenue website, free of \n57\ncharge and carefully indexed and divided into bite-sized sections. It is, of course, \ndesigned for Inland Revenue staff and not the public. It will also be valuable to tax \nprofessionals. It would be very difficult for an ordinary member of the public to use, \nhowever, because the level of detail might bewilder rather than clarify. This is why an \nintermediate document, somewhere between IR56 and the ESM, is needed for general \npurposes. \nIR35 guidance and the ESM \n3.45 The analysis in the IR35 guidance does pay more heed to Hall v Lorimer than \ndoes IR56. It also gives some useful examples of application. It commences by \nemphasising that classification of workers is not a mechanical exercise of weighing up \nfactors but one of looking at the picture as a whole, and the method of dealing with \nthe examples bears this out. It then lists factors to be considered. It commences with \ncontrol, which is an odd choice of starting-point since, as seen above, this factor has \nplayed a less prominent part in recent case law. The analysis makes it clear that the \nright to determine how the work is done is not an essential feature of employment, but \nplaces more weight on the ability of a client to say what work is to be done and when. \nIf the worker is required to work as part of a co-ordinated team, for example, that is \nsaid to point to employment. Of course, many consultants will have to work with a \nteam but this will not make them part of the team. The examples given show the \ndifference between being part of a team and checking on its operation, but this might \nnot be so clear from the guidance. \n                                                                                                                                            \n57\n This accessibility is welcome, although the fact that the ESM can only be read and printed \noff in these paragraph-length sections is inconvenient. \n 493.46 The discussion in IR35 of the right to use a substitute seems unexceptionable. \nIt is established in the cases that the right to send in a substitute does suggest that the \n58\npersonal relationship inherent in an employment contract is not present. The recent \nconfirmation of this in the employment case of Express and Echo Publications v \n59\nTanton seems to have made the Inland Revenue nervous, which is understandable, \nsince much weight was placed by the Court of Appeal in that case on what was agreed \nrather than on what actually occurred. There is a reasonable concern that a clause \ncould be inserted into a contract stating that substitution was possible without any \nintention of actually relying on that clause. It is notable, however, that the permission \nto substitute in the Echo case was expressly held not to be sham, so that it is clear that \nany such provision must be genuine. The Inland Revenue has now stated, in its \nanswers to frequently asked questions on IR35, that there is no genuine right to \nsubstitute where the client does not mind, from one day to the next, who carries out \nthe work. This seems to go beyond the case law: no doubt the client had a preference \nin Hall v Lorimer and Echo for its original choice of worker, but that did not negate \n60\nthe importance of the right to substitute if it was not a sham. \n3.47 The section in the IR35 guidance on equipment may also give too much \nemphasis to a particular point. It states that \n‘where an IT consultant is engaged to undertake a specific piece of work and must \nwork exclusively at home using the worker’s own computer equipment that will be a \nstrong pointer to self-employment. But where a worker is provided with office space \nand computer equipment that points to employment’. \nGiven the complexity of modern equipment and systems, consultants will often need \nto work on their clients’ equipment to check out systems or to ensure that their work is \ncompatible with that of the business and of the right quality. Mr Lorimer used the film \nstudio’s very expensive equipment but this did not prevent him from being self-\nemployed. It is clear from the Inland Revenue’s own example of Charlotte, a \nborderline worker who it ultimately decides would be self-employed, that using the \nclient’s equipment is only a pointer towards employment and not fatal to a claim of \nself-employment. Overall, the IR35 guidance gives completely fair guidance, but a lay \nperson reading it could be forgiven for thinking that use of the client’s equipment \nwould be more important than it might turn out to be.  \n61\n3.48 The section dealing with this in the ESM is more balanced, as it can be \n62\nbecause it is more detailed. Redston points out, however, that the ESM misleadingly \nrefers to Mummery J in the High Court rather than to the Court of Appeal decision, in \nwhich, as we have seen, Nolan LJ gave no importance to equipment or the other \n                                                                                                                                            \n58\n Ready Mixed Concrete v Minister of Pensions (1968) 2QB 497. \n59\n [1999] ICR 693 CA, discussed at para. 3.87 below. \n60\n See Redston, fn. 47 above, at p. 109 on this point. \n61\n ESM 1062. \n62\n Redston, fn. 47 above, at p. 113. \n 50 \ntrappings of business in the case of someone carrying on a profession. The difficulty is \nnot so much, though, that the emphasis should be on one point or another: all the \npoints mentioned by the Inland Revenue are relevant and would certainly be used by \nCounsel in argument or cited in a textbook. The problem for the taxpayer is that he \ndoes not wish to engage in an intellectual debate about the factors in his particular \ncase, but rather he wants a clear answer. As this discussion shows, despite all its \nefforts to give clear guidance, the Inland Revenue cannot give firm answers because \nthese do not exist in the light of the importance placed by the courts on the facts of \neach case. \n3.49 In referring to financial risk as a factor, the IR35 guidance makes an \ninteresting point. It states that where a skilled worker incurs significant amounts of \nexpenditure on training to provide himself with a skill that he uses in subsequent \nengagement, this can be seen in the same way as an investment in equipment, since he \nmight not recover the cost from his income. Thus it is a pointer to self-employment. \nThis could be very helpful to workers using personal service companies, who are \ncurrently complaining that they will not be able to deduct all their training expenditure \nunder the new legislation. Perhaps the answer to them is that if the expenditure is \nsubstantial, they can argue that the new legislation should not apply to them, relying \non this point. \n3.50 Personal factors, particularly the number of clients worked for throughout the \nyear, are listed in the IR35 guidance and the ESM, giving proper weight to Hall v \nLorimer on this point. The number of clients is stated to carry less weight in the case \nof an unskilled worker, which is consistent with Nolan LJ’s comments in that case. \nOnce again, this shows that what is a very significant factor in the hierarchy in one \nsituation is less so in another. Another related factor is the length of the engagement, \nalthough the IR35 guidance makes it clear that a series of short contracts with one \nclient will be looked at as one longer engagement. Any other approach would give \nobvious scope for avoidance. Whether the worker has a businesslike approach and has \noffice accommodation and equipment is also referred to in this context, though this \nwas not of major significance in Hall v Lorimer. It could, however, be important in \nbuilding up the overall picture. \n3.51 The IR35 guidance and the ESM go through other factors also: basis of \npayment, opportunity to profit from sound management, whether the worker is part \nand parcel of the client’s organisation, employee benefits, the right of dismissal and \nthe role of intention. The most useful aspect of the guidance is the IR35 examples, \nbecause they explain the process of balancing factors in a way that it is impossible to \ndo within a list of considerations. Use of similar but more wide-ranging examples \nwithin a more general guidance booklet for the public would be welcome. Even then, \neach case will involve a considerable amount of subjective judgement. \n 51Tax guidance and other areas of law \n3.52 As we shall see, one difficult and confusing issue for workers seeking to \nestablish their status can be that their status for tax purposes is different from that for \nother purposes, or that the authorities are seeking to treat them differently for the \npurposes of different taxes (for example, VAT and income tax).  \n3.53 The Inland Revenue guidance is unable to provide any reassurance on that \nscore. IR56 states that \n‘Other considerations may also be relevant [in employment law matters], so your \nposition under employment law will not necessarily be the same as under tax and \nNational Insurance law. For employment protection purposes the industrial tribunals, \nwhich are independent bodies, will decide whether someone who makes a complaint \nis employed or self-employed’. \n3.54 This is, as we shall see, a factually correct statement, but it gives no indication \nof how or why the position might differ under employment law and tax law. There are \nsome statutory differences, but for the most part the taxpayer will be advised, if he \nasks, that the tests are the same. This, then, is confusing advice.  \n3.55 When we turn to the more detailed ESM, we find Inland Revenue staff being \nadvised that they are not bound on the question of the income tax status of an \nindividual on the basis that they have registered for VAT, made returns assuming self-\nemployment, applied and been accepted to pay self-employed NICs or received a \n63\ndecision from an employment tribunal. Again, this is factually correct, but it is stated \nbaldly with no explanation, though it can leave the taxpayer in a very difficult \nsituation. Inland Revenue staff are told, however, that their opinion might directly \n64\naffect benefit entitlement and indirectly affect such matters as VAT.  \n3.56 There are some clues to the differences between tax and employment law \nconsiderations in the body of the ESM. One factor, which is not discussed in IR56 or \nthe IR35 guidance, but which is dealt with in the ESM, is that of mutuality of \nobligation; that is, whether there is an ongoing requirement to provide work and to \n65\naccept it. This, we shall see, is an important factor in a number of employment law \ncases. Because of the requirements of continuity and length of service in employment \nlaw, the worker often needs to show that an umbrella employment exists, not just a \nseries of short contracts of employment. For income tax purposes, this will have fewer \nimplications, since tax and NICs will be payable on what has been earned whether the \ncontract of employment is short-term or part of a longer-term arrangement. A short-\nterm contract may nevertheless be a contract of employment, for tax and employment \nlaw purposes. \n                                                                                                                                            \n63\n ESM 0112; ESM 1071. \n64\n ESM 0005. \n65\n See Carmichael v National Power plc, fn. 32 above, discussed at para. 3.85 below. \n 52 \n3.57 On mutuality, the ESM states: \n‘This aspect is rarely of practical use when considering status from a tax or NICs \npoint of view and it can confuse the issue … Do not consider this factor when \nreviewing a worker’s status, unless the engager or worker raises it.’ \nThere is something a little unhelpful about the way this is phrased, since the taxpayer \nmay be confused by references to mutuality in an employment context and may need \nhelp with understanding why this is less relevant for tax purposes. The ESM reiterates \nthe requirement on the Inland Revenue under its Service Commitment to help \n66\ntaxpayers get their affairs right and this might involve discussion of mutuality.  \n3.58 The Inland Revenue’s approach is also a little surprising, since one might \nexpect that it would sometimes wish to utilise the mutuality factor to show that a \ncontract of employment does exist. It is true that the absence of a mutual obligation to \nprovide further work and to take it up will not mean that there is no short-term \ncontract of employment in relation to work actually done. In the IR35 guidance, \nhowever, the Inland Revenue states that ‘regular working for the same engager may \n67\nindicate that there is a single and continuing contract of employment’. Mutuality \nwould be an issue in any such claim, since the taxpayer might argue that there was a \nseries of short-term contracts, which, taken with other factors, pointed to self-\nemployment over all. To isolate one set of contracts as an employment contract would \nrequire mutuality. The Inland Revenue might have cause to regret the downplaying of \n68\nthis concept in its guidance in the future. \n3.59 The complexity and uncertainty surrounding the classification cases in tax law \nmay result in the taxpayer needing to obtain detailed personal advice from the Inland \nRevenue on his tax and National Insurance position. Each Inland Revenue Enquiry \nCentre, Tax Office and Inland Revenue (NI Contributions) local office has a \nnominated officer responsible for enquiries and decisions about employment status \n69\nwho can be required to give written advice. This is not always a quick and \nstraightforward procedure, as discussed in Chapter 5, where appeals from such \ndecisions are also discussed. A recent survey on tax compliance costs for employers \nfound that employers felt they needed clearer guidance on employment status, \n70\nespecially in relation to casual workers. The newly published ESM might help, but \nsome more compact guidance giving examples is needed. \n3.60 The alternative route to advice is to turn to lawyers and accountants, although, \nas seen from the above discussion, the task of advising on what is, to a considerable \n                                                                                                                                            \n66\n ESM 0005. \n67\n It cites Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner [1984] ICR 612 in support. \n68\n Redston, fn. 47 above, at p. 108 suggests that it might be used in litigation in future in \nrelation to IR35. \n69\n IR56 and ESM. \n70\n The Bath Report, fn. 8 Introduction above. \n 53degree, a question of fact is not necessarily straightforward even for those so \nqualified. What is more, this can add to the cost of setting up and running a business, \n71\nespecially a small business. \n3.61 The new focus on classification under the personal service intermediaries \nlegislation is likely to concentrate further attention on the income tax case law tests. It \nis very probable that we shall see litigation brought by those affected by the new \nlegislation. If the courts, however, continue to apply their current, very fact-based, \napproach to this legislation, it will not necessarily result in useful precedents. Possibly \nthe courts will accept the need to lay down further guidance, as they have in the past \n72\nwhen absence of guidance on the meaning of words in tax law has caused problems.  \n3.62 We should not underestimate the ability of the courts to make an impact, \nshould they wish to do so. It is clear from the discussion above that a number of cases \nhave had a significant impact in bringing the law into line with modern economic \nconditions – for example, by reducing the importance of the control test and by \nmaking it clear that having no equipment does not necessarily make the taxpayer an \nemployee. In many ways, case law is far better suited to this area than would be \nstatutory rules, but, as ever, there is a need to balance the need to retain flexibility \nwith the need for certainty in commercial arrangements. Personal service companies \nhave been used as a way of escaping uncertainty in the past; the removal of this escape \nroute may place additional strain on a legal test already under pressure. \nClassification case law and NICs \n3.63 Liability to NICs and the class of NICs to be paid depend upon whether the \n73\npayer is an employed earner or self-employed. An employed earner is defined as ‘a \nperson who is gainfully employed in Great Britain either under a contract of service or \nin an office (including elective office) with emoluments chargeable to income tax \n74\nunder Schedule E’. The question of whether a person is working under a contract of \nservice is the same question as that which has to be answered for income tax and \nemployment law purposes, and one would expect the same case law to be applied \nwhen addressing that part of the NICs definition. \n3.64 In the past, National Insurance status cases have reached the High Court via a \ndetermination of the Secretary of State, via an inquiry of the Office for the \nDetermination of Contribution Questions (ODCQ). These decisions were once \n75\npublished, but publication ceased on grounds of confidentiality. What follows refers \n                                                                                                                                            \n71\n The Bath Report, fn. 8 Introduction above. \n72\n As in the case of the meaning of ‘trade’, for example, although this too is still a concept \naround which there can be uncertainty. \n73\n See Appendix to this paper for details. \n74\n Section 2 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. \n75\n Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 above, at para. 51.02. \n 54 \nbriefly to some of what is known of the jurisprudence arising from this route. As \ndiscussed in Chapter 5 below, such cases are now being heard initially by the Tax \nAppeal Commissioners. This is a welcome change, which should go a long way to \nimproving consistency of decisions in the future for tax and National Insurance \npurposes. Moreover, as explained further in Chapter 5, the Inland Revenue is now \nresponsible for NICs, following merger with the Contributions Agency. The ESM, \ndiscussed above, is now the guidance that applies for NICs issues as well as taxation. \nHopefully this will bring the decisions into line in the vast majority of cases. \n3.65 There are some important statutory differences between tax and National \nInsurance classifications where the Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) \n76\nRegulations apply. The details of these Regulations and their rationale or lack of it \nare discussed in Chapter 4 below. The following discussion applies to the majority of \ncases where those special statutory classifications do not apply, so that the case law \ngoverns the position and, theoretically at least, the test is the same as for tax cases. \n77\n3.66 The leading case of Market Investigations, establishing the so-called \neconomic reality test, has been discussed above and it should be noted that, although \nthis was a National Insurance case, it has been widely applied in a tax context. In \npractice, though, especially where tax and National Insurance cases arise in different \ncontexts, differences in emphasis can arise. In particular, if the issue of National \n78\nInsurance status arises in the context of benefit entitlement, there may be issues of \ncontinuity of service to consider. This gives the National Insurance cases a hybrid \nquality: in theory, they need to ‘fit’ both tax and employment law decisions, which \ncan be difficult, if not impossible, due to the divergences created by the different \nappeal systems. Although this will be met in part by the fact that National Insurance \ncases will now be heard by tax tribunals, the cases may still arise in rather different \ncircumstances that could affect the approach of the courts.  \n3.67 For example, the mutuality of obligations questions, discussed elsewhere in \nthis paper, could be more important in relation to NICs than they are in relation to \ntaxation. Thus statutory sick pay is only payable if a contract of employment lasts for \nmore than three months. The tax tribunal will be used to a situation in which it only \nhas to decide whether a short-term engagement is a contract of employment or not. \nFor deciding entitlement to statutory sick pay, however, it may also need to consider \nwhether there is an umbrella contract, so mutuality will be an important factor. It \nremains to be seen exactly how the Tax Commissioners will evolve this jurisdiction \nand to what extent decisions in one area will affect the other. \n3.68 In the past, National Insurance decisions seem to have taken as their starting-\n79\npoint an employment case, Addison v London Philharmonic Orchestra Ltd. This \n                                                                                                                                            \n76\n SI 1978/1689 as amended. \n77\n Discussed at paras 3.22 et seq. above. \n78\n As it may do under section 8 of the Social Security (Transfer of Functions etc. ) Act 1999. \n79\n [1981] ICR 261. \n 55case set out the questions to be asked in deciding employment status, known as the \n‘Addison tests’, although the case did not originate these tests but merely drew them \ntogether from the earlier cases. These tests were adopted as the basis for an interview \nformat to guide local DSS and Inland Revenue staff on status determinations prior to \n80\nthe merger of these organisations. The Addison tests were similar in most respects to \nthe ‘badges’ applied for tax purposes, but not identical. For example, the basis of \nincome taxation paid by the worker appears as one of 21 factors and is not seen as \ndeterminative of the issue. \n3.69 Even prior to the merger of the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency, \nhowever, the intention was that both bodies should have a common approach to the \n81\ndetermination of employment status. In the past, differences have still arisen. The \n82\nauthor has on file details of the case of Mrs Patel, where an ODCQ inquiry came to \nthe conclusion that a homeworker was employed, despite an earlier finding by the \n83\nGeneral Commissioners that she was self-employed. An industrial tribunal had held \nthat the same worker was an employee and that she was entitled to compensation for \nunfair dismissal.  \n3.70 The ODCQ Inquirer was aware of the previous decisions but refused to take \naccount of them when Mrs Patel’s case came before him. He quoted Rose J in Renn-\n84\nJennings v The Secretary of State, who said, in a similar situation, ‘it is the Secretary \nof State who is expressly empowered to determine the matter and the exercise of this \npower cannot be pre-empted or inhibited by the findings of another tribunal’. The \nInquirer therefore stated that the matters in the Patel case would be the subject of full \nand fresh consideration by the Inquiry. Hopefully, confusing occurrences such as this \nwill now be avoided, though it is to be noted that the employment law decision \ndiffered from that of the Tax Commissioners and nothing has occurred to change this \npossibility. \n3.71 The case stated of the General Commissioners in the Patel case notes that the \nInspector of Taxes for the Inland Revenue argued that it regarded all textile \noutworkers as self-employed. This seems to have been a settled local position and the \nlocal General Commissioners were not inclined to question it. The Inquirer was \nlooking at the issue from a more detached legal position and applied the Addison tests \nthat originated in employment law. For the Commissioners, the issue was whether the \n                                                                                                                                            \n80\n DSS, A Review of Legislation on Employment Status for National Insurance Purposes \n(unpublished report 1994) (hereafter the DSS 1994 report), at p. 23 and Appendix C.

The author would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Leicester Outwork \ncampaign in providing details and documentation, which the author has on file. \n83\n Under the new system outlined in Chapter 4, this should not be possible. \n84\n A decision of Rose J in the High Court (CO/1132/87), 12 May 1988 (unreported). \n 56 \nclient/employer should have paid tax under PAYE, but for the Inquirer the focus was \non entitlement to benefits. \n3.72 Under the new appeal arrangements, both issues would be considered by the \nTax Commissioners, but how they will deal with the different considerations arising is \nnot yet clear. The problem remains that, although we might expect a person’s status to \nbe identical for tax and National Insurance purposes under the new system, National \nInsurance issues may arise in a situation where an employment tribunal has come to a \ndifferent conclusion on employment law status. National Insurance continues to have \na difficult hybrid status in this situation. \nEmployment law \nThe purposive approach \n3.73 The 1993 version of the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency guidelines \nin IR56/NI39 stated that the same guidelines applied for employment law as for tax \nand National Insurance. By 1995, when IR56 was updated, however, the position was \nstated to be that there could be differences, as discussed above. \n3.74 This change in wording reflects the purposive approach of the employment \n85\n(formerly industrial) tribunal and employment appeals tribunal, which tend towards \nfinding the existence of ‘employment’ which then gives them jurisdiction to apply the \nemployment protection legislation. The employment tribunals are quite openly \nenthusiastic about preventing employers from using devices to escape the full effect of \nthis legislation and it is recognised that they take a purposive approach to employment \n86\nprotection legislation where possible. The employment tribunals and employment \nlaw literature generally are comfortable with the idea that the word ‘employee’ must \nbe construed in the context of the relevant legislation. So, one leading text states: \n‘The answer to the question “Servant or not?” may depend upon the purpose for \nwhich you want to know. Obviously, different tribunals may reach different \nconclusions on the same facts. Thus an industrial tribunal may regard a worker as a \nservant for the purposes of unfair dismissal or redundancy, despite the fact that the \nInspector of Taxes has held him to be self-employed for tax purposes (Airfix Footwear \n87\nLtd v Cope ) … Different policy considerations apply. In the case of vicarious \nliability, the court will mainly be concerned with adequate protection of innocent third \nparties; in the case of National Insurance, with the improper avoidance of \n88\ncontributions and so on.’ \n                                                                                                                                            \n85\n Note that since August 1998 industrial tribunals are known as employment tribunals. \n86\n For a recent statement on this, see Johnson v Ryan [2000] ICR 236. \n87\n [1978] ILR 1210. \n88\n See B. Perrins (ed.), Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law, (1972) loose-\nleaf, Butterworths, London, at A[9] (hereafter Perrins). \n 573.75 This should be contrasted, however, with the Court of Appeal’s view in \n89\nBottrill that there was no justification for giving the term ‘employee’ special \nmeaning for the purposes of the Employment Rights Act 1996. There was no \njustification for departing from employment law generally or for distinguishing Lee v \n90\nLee's Air Farming Ltd, a case on corporate personality. This was a very significant \nstatement from Lord Woolf MR, which should carry great weight, but it is not clear \nwhether it will be picked up and followed in the employment tribunals. Bottrill \ncontinued to lay stress on the facts, which leaves significant scope for interpretation to \ntribunals. \n3.76 As one employment law text argues, although the vagueness of the status test \nmay be unsatisfactory from an analytical point of view, it reflects the practical \n91\nposition. These authors contend that it is appropriate for lay members of employment \ntribunals to apply their industrial experience to the resolution of status issues in the \n92\ncontext of modern statutory rights. Sometimes, though, they will be seen as having \ngone too far by the higher courts. Thus, in Costain Building & Civil Engineering Ltd v \n93\nSmith, the Employment Appeal Tribunal allowed an appeal on the basis that the \ntribunal had lost sight of the facts and was perverse to look through an agency \nagreement and construct an employment contract between the applicant and the \ncontractors. There can be no doubt, though, that the tribunal members’ backgrounds \nwill make a purposive approach appealing to them. \n94\n3.77 It was observed in the DTI employment status report referred to above that to \ntake this approach to the extreme would make it impossible to predict how the courts \nwould decide the status of a particular individual. This report comments that \nuncertainty mainly arises in practice in non-standard employment relationships. \nAlthough it considers that some degree of uncertainty in the operation of the law in \nthis area is probably unavoidable, it comments that ‘… a situation in which a \nsubstantial proportion of the workforce is unsure as to its legal position would give \nrise to concern.’ The report then goes on to examine empirically the extent to which \nthere is uncertainty about status amongst non-standard workers.

The modern tendency has been \nto use the contract of employment concept as the central one, but to extend it \naccording to the purpose of the legislation, sometimes covering also all those \nemployed under ‘a contract personally to execute any work or labour’. More recently \nstill, the favoured approach has been to use the term ‘worker’. Even the extended \ndefinitions of ‘worker’, discussed in Chapter 4, however, make reference to work \nunder a ‘contract of employment’ as a component of that definition. Therefore the \nquestion of what is a contract of service remains significant. \n3.79 This development of broader statutory definitions encourages employment \ntribunals to think of status questions more generally in a wider and purposive \n96\ncontext. One leading text states of these extended definitions: ‘It must thus be clear \nthat the law may categorise workers as it wishes in accordance with the objectives to \n97\nbe achieved’. \n3.80 Despite these wider definitions, the starting-point, and in some cases the only \ntrue issue for the courts, is the application of the case law on the meaning of contract \nof service. As for tax and National Insurance, the cases apply a mixed test balancing \n98\nthe various factors of personal service, control, integration into the organisation, \ncriteria of service and, of course, the economic reality test, which can be said to \n99 \nsubsume them all. Control has been severely criticised as a test in the employment \nlaw literature. One commentator has gone so far as to state that ‘the right of control \nfails to distinguish employment from self-employment because its presence is entirely \n100\nconsistent with either type of contract’. \n                                                                                                                                            \n95\n Section 230.  \n96\n General and Municipal Boilermakers (GMB) National Office Project Team, Employment \nStatus: Recommendations for Reform, (1997).

Brodie, \n‘The contract for work’, (1998) Scottish Law and Practice Quarterly, vol. 2, pp. 138–48.  \n 59Mutuality of obligation  \n3.81 As discussed in the income tax section above, one issue that seems to be of \ngreater significance in the context of employment law than for tax purposes is that of \nmutual obligation. According to the employment law cases, there must be an \nirreducible minimum of obligation on each side to create a contract of service: some \nkind of remuneration on the part of the employer and some obligation to provide his \n101\nown work on the part of the employee. As we have seen, for tax purposes there is a \nconcern only with the relationship at the time the payment potentially subject to tax is \nmade. Provided each separate engagement is an employment (that is, for that \nengagement there was an obligation to pay on one side and to provide service on the \n102\nother), there is no need to look further to see whether there is an umbrella \nemployment. In theory, National Insurance will normally follow taxation, although it \nhas been suggested above that mutuality might also be important in relation to \n103\nNational Insurance. \n3.82 In addition, there are statutory provisions that result in agency workers being \nsubject to income tax and National Insurance as if they were employees (discussed \nfurther in Chapter 4), but that do not apply for employment protection purposes. The \nEmployment Appeal Tribunal held, in Wickens v Champion Employment Agency \n104\nLtd, that, although tax and National Insurance were deducted under these statutory \nrules, temporaries in an employment agency were not employed for the purposes of \nthe Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. There was no obligation on \neither side to accept or offer bookings and there was not ‘a relationship that had the \nelements of continuity and care associated with the relationship created by a contract \nof employment’. \n3.83 This mutuality factor is of critical importance for non-standard workers such \nas casual workers, homeworkers and agency workers. These workers may be \nclassified as employees for tax and National Insurance purposes and indeed be \nemployees in respect of each engagement for employment law purposes. However, \nthey may still not be able to show sufficient mutuality to cover the periods in between \nperiods of work and so satisfy the continuity of employment requirements for \nemployment protection purposes. As the DTI employment status report points out, the \ninteraction of the mutuality rule and the rules that require continuity of employment \n                                                                                                                                            \n101\n Ready-Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \n[1968] 2 QB 497; Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Taverna and Gardiner [1984] IRLR 240; \nO’Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [1983] IRLR 369; Clark v Oxfordshire Health Authority \n[1998] IRLR 125 CA – ‘bank nurses’ were held not to be employees due to lack of mutuality \nof obligation; Carmichael v National Power plc, fn. 32 above. \n102\n ESM 1071. \n103\n See paras 3.66 and 3.67 above. \n104\n [1984] ICR 365; see also McMeechan v Secretary of State for Employment [1997] IRLR \n353 (a specific engagement with an agency held to be an employment notwithstanding label \nto the contrary). \n 60 \nfor there to be an entitlement to certain benefits (such as statutory sick pay, statutory \nmaternity pay and statutory redundancy payments) may deny workers, who have been \ntaxed and have paid National Insurance as employees, various aspects of employment \n105\nprotection and benefit entitlement. \n3.84 Whilst this may well be perceived as unfair, it is not so much the consequence \nof inconsistency between tax, National Insurance and employment classification rules \nas of the rules requiring various levels of continuous employment as a basis for \nentitlement. The different tribunals are not disagreeing in their analysis of a particular \n106\ncontract but are focusing on engagements at different levels. \n3.85 The mutuality of obligation principle was discussed in Carmichael v National \nPower plc. Two guides at Blyth Power Stations were offered work when there was \nwork for them to do, normally accepted it and were paid by the hour. They were held \nby the Court of Appeal, overturning the decision of the industrial tribunal, to be \nemployed under a contract of service and therefore entitled to written particulars of \nthe terms of their employment under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act \n1978. The fact that the guides had had employee NICs deducted from their pay was \none (small) factor that was weighed in the balance. For a time, this looked like a chink \nin the mutuality principle that might help casual workers. The House of Lords, \nhowever, allowed the employer’s appeal and upheld the decision of the industrial \ntribunal that the guides were not in any contractual relationship with National Power \n107\nwhen they were not working. \n3.86 Their Lordships considered that the Court of Appeal had placed too much \nemphasis on the construction of the documents between the parties (a question of law) \nand not enough on the surrounding circumstances (a question of fact for the \n108\ntribunal). Thus the Court of Appeal had been wrong to overturn the decision of the \ntribunal. In any event, on the documents, their Lordships considered that there was an \nabsence of mutual obligation. Lord Hoffmann was of the view that the guides may \nwell have been employed whilst actually performing the work, but this was not \nenough to give them the entitlement they sought.  \n3.87 By contrast, in a recent Court of Appeal case, Express and Echo Publications \n109\nLimited v Tanton, where a contract contained a clause permitting a worker to \nsubstitute another for him, it was held that, as a matter of law, the relationship \nbetween the worker and the person for whom he worked was not one of employment. \nThis was a case where an employee had been made redundant and then very soon \n                                                                                                                                            \n105\n The DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above, at para. 2.4. \n106\n For practical purposes, the employment law problem can sometimes be tackled by \nstatutory techniques for extending qualifying periods – see Collins 2000, fn. 11 Chapter 1 \nabove, and para. 4.55 below. \n107\n Carmichael v National Power plc, fn. 32 above. \n108\n On this distinction, see further paras 3.102 et seq. below. \n109\n Fn. 59 above. \n 61afterwards entered into a new agreement containing this clause. The court considered \nthat the issue was a question of law because it related to the question of whether the \nclause in the written contract was inherently inconsistent with a contract of \nemployment. This may give welcome guidance. On the other hand, it is being argued \nin some quarters that ‘Echo’ clauses will become a simple way of avoiding \nemployment status, especially where the new personal service company provisions \n110\nwould otherwise apply. This seems unlikely to be effective. The tribunal in Echo \nhad expressly held that the clause was not a sham and Mr Tanton had in fact provided \na substitute driver when he was ill. Client/employers may not be ready to accept this \ntype of clause as a device, and evidence that it was purely formal and that substitution \n111\nwas not actually permitted would destroy its effectiveness. \nRelationship between employment law and tax and National Insurance \n3.88 The employment tribunals have sometimes expressly addressed the question of \ntax and National Insurance, but with mixed and inconclusive results. They do appear \nto have cited to them some of the major tax cases, especially, recently, Hall v \n112 113\nLorimer. The case of Young & Woods Ltd v West is sometimes cited as authority \nthat there is one single test to be employed in relation to all matters. In that case, West \nwas offered a ‘choice’ of status by the company to which he was supplying services. \nThe company said he could be an employee or an independent contractor. As an \nemployee he would be paid net of tax, but as a self-employed person he would be paid \ngross. If self-employed, however, he would be the first to go if there were \nredundancies. West ‘elected’ to be self-employed. Nevertheless, when the company \nsubsequently dispensed with his services, he successfully claimed to be entitled to \nclaim unfair dismissal. The Court of Appeal took the view that the true legal position \nfor all purposes was that West was an employee and that the Inland Revenue had a \n114\nstatutory duty to tax him retrospectively as an employee. It was not a matter on \nwhich the parties had a choice or election, but of the true legal relationship between \nthe parties. \n3.89 Any other decision in the Young case would have meant that effectively the \nparties could have contracted out of the employment protection legislation and opted \ninto what the parties perceived to be fiscal advantages. The Court distinguished the \n                                                                                                                                            \n110\n See, for example, P. Vaines, ‘Taxing matters’, (1999) New Law Journal, 5 November. \n111\n There was some evidence in the Echo case itself that substitution was not normally \npermitted but this evidence had not been presented to the industrial tribunal, the tribunal of \nfact, and so was not admissible.  \n112\n Fn. 39 above. \n113\n [1980] IRLR 201 CA. \n114\n The Young case assumed that, once the employment status of the worker had been decided \nfor employment protection purposes, the Inland Revenue would seek to rectify the tax \nposition, although it may well not be a simple matter to do this – see Appendix below at fn. \n25. \n 62 \n115\nearlier case of Massey v Crown Insurance Co. where an insurance agent had entered \ninto an agreement accepted by the Inland Revenue as resulting in his being self-\nemployed and then attempted to claim unfair dismissal. There, Lord Denning had \nstated: \n‘If the parties deliberately arrange to be self-employed to obtain tax benefits, that is \nstrong evidence that that is the real relationship … having made his bed as self-\nemployed he must lie on it.’ \n3.90 Again, this supports consistency but takes more account of the previous \narrangement with the Inland Revenue. This was on the basis that, where the status \nquestion is ambiguous, the label the parties use may be of significance in determining \nthe relationship. The Young case confirmed that the label used by the parties might be \nrelevant when deciding the parties’ intention, but could not alter their true legal \nrelationship if other factors pointed elsewhere. Neither case envisaged that status for \ntax and National Insurance purposes could differ from that for employment law \npurposes. \n3.91 Other employment law cases have been less concerned with consistency. In \n116\nO’Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc, for example, the taxpayers, who were ‘regular \ncasuals’ in the catering industry, paid tax and National Insurance as employees. That \nwas held by the industrial tribunal not to be indicative, of itself, of the legal basis of \nthe relationship. Ackner LJ accepted this without comment in the Court of Appeal and \nwent on to agree with the industrial tribunal that there was no contract of employment. \nThere was no recommendation that the tax position should be reviewed: this was \nsimply not mentioned and it is not known what occurred in practice.  \n117\n3.92 In  Lane v Shire Roofing C (Oxford) Ltd, a builder had been paying tax as \nself-employed but was held to be an employee for health and safety legislation \npurposes. This was considered to be a matter of public interest. The policy of the law \nwas to make the employer liable for safety. The fact that there were tax and other \nadvantages in avoiding the employee label did not remove the policy reasons in the \nsafety-at-work field for ensuring that ‘the law properly discriminated between \nemployees and independent contractors’. \n3.93 The  Lane case must be contrasted with an earlier Court of Appeal case, Calder \n118\nv H Kitson Vickers Ltd. In that case, Ralph Gibson LJ stated that \n‘… a conclusion on status is a decision of fact upon all the relevant factors. But the \ndecision does not depend upon the circumstances in which the question is raised, that \n                                                                                                                                            \n115\n [1978] IRLR 31, followed in the tax case of Barnett v Brabyn, fn. 4 above, on the \nrelevance of labels. \n116\n Fn. 45 above. \n117\n [1995] IRLR 493. \n118\n [1988] ICR 232. \n 63is to say, for example, whether it is a claim for damages for personal injury or an issue \nas to the obligation to deduct National Insurance contributions.’ \nIt is notable, however, that this was not an employment law but an insurance case. \nThere seems to be a greater inclination amongst the judges to classify status in a \npurposive way in the employment and health-and-safety-at-work fields than \nelsewhere. \nOwner-controlled companies \n3.94 The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in Catamaran Cruisers Case Ltd v \n119\nWilliams did not appear concerned with this issue of consistency. In that case, the \nworker, Williams, set up his own limited company and supplied his services through \nthis intermediary, a common practice in some industries. This was prior to the \n120\nintroduction of the legislation on personal service intermediaries. If the company \ntruly existed and entered into the contract to supply the services, then this was \n121\nnormally accepted by the Inland Revenue as effective for tax purposes. However, in \nthis case, Williams wanted both the tax and National Insurance advantages of this \narrangement and employment protection. He brought a case for unfair dismissal on the \nground that he was an employee. The EAT found that the industrial tribunal had not \nerred in finding that Williams was an employee, despite the existence of the limited \nliability company. \n3.95 The EAT accepted that a company has a separate legal personality and did not \nhold that this company was a sham. They noted that payments had been made gross to \nthe company (without deduction of tax) and did not criticise this arrangement. This \nseems to have left the company intact for tax purposes as well as company law \n122\npurposes in accordance with cases such as Lee v Lee’s Air Farming Ltd. Williams \nappeared to succeed in eating his cake and keeping it, in the way condemned by \nDenning in Massey, cited above. The personal service intermediaries legislation will \nhave the effect of ensuring that, usually, such a person is taxed as if he were receiving \nSchedule E payments in such a situation. In a case like Catamaran, therefore, on the \nface of it, it looks as though this new legislation might achieve a result consistent with \nthe approach of the employment tribunal, but this outcome will not be certain. \n3.96 The problem is that the personal service intermediaries legislation itself does \nnot affect employment law at all. Unlike the original proposals, the final legislation \ndoes little to encourage a move to direct labour, and the government seems to have no \n123\nintention of reviewing the impact of this legislation on employment law. Therefore \n                                                                                                                                            \n119\n [1994] IRLR 389. \n120\n Discussed in Chapter 4 below. \n121\n Inland Revenue Decision 4 (February 1992). \n122\n Fn. 90 above. \n123\n See paras 4.92–4.95 below. \n 64 \nit is a question of fact in each case whether the employment tribunal considers there to \nbe an employment despite the existence of a company. This gives no certainty to \nworkers, caught under the new tax and legislation, that they will obtain employment \nprotection rights. Of course, the answer for them is to insist on direct employment, if \nthey can, and the removal of the tax and NICs incentives to do otherwise may assist \nwith this, but client/employers may continue to insist on working through \nintermediary companies, as discussed in Chapter 4 below. Part of their reason for \ndoing this may be to deny the worker employment protection rights. It remains to be \nseen whether the employment tribunals and higher courts will take the new tax \nlegislation into account when considering employment law issues. It is unfortunate \nthat the government has not reviewed the employment law issues concerning \nintermediaries at the same time as legislating on the tax and NICs aspects. \n3.97 The question of whether a controlling shareholder of a company can also be an \nemployee has arisen recently in a different context: in connection with rights under the \nEmployment Rights Act 1966 (ERA) to collect statutory redundancy and other \npayments on the insolvency of that company. In Buchan and Ivey v Secretary of State \n124\nfor Employment, the EAT decided that a controlling shareholder could not be an \nemployee for that purpose because he controlled his own dismissal from the company. \nThis decision was not followed in the subsequent case of Secretary of State for Trade \n125\nand Industry v Bottrill, where the EAT held that whether a sole shareholder of a \n126\ncompany was also its employee for this purpose was purely a question of fact. In that \ncase, it was held that the industrial tribunal had not erred in holding the claimant to be \nan employee. \n127\n3.98 The Court of Appeal upheld the EAT’s decision in Bottrill and cast doubt on \nthe reasoning in Buchan. In its view, control of shareholder voting by a person should \nnot necessarily preclude that person having the status of employee. First, shareholder \ncontrol does not necessarily give immediate control of management decisions over \ndismissal. Second, the Court of Appeal disliked the attempt to give a special meaning to \nthe word employee for employment protection purposes that it does not have under \ngeneral law or in other contexts. It had been suggested to the Court of Appeal that its \n128\nguidance was needed in order to provide a clear and simple test of when ERA applied. \nIt stated that it felt unable to give this guidance as a question of law, deciding that the \ngeneral definition of employee applied and could only be decided by having regard to all \nthe relevant facts. \n                                                                                                                                            \n124\n [1997] BCC 145 (EAT). \n125\n [1998] IRLR 120. \n126\n Similarly in Fleming v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1997] IRLR 682. \n127\n [1999] BCC 177. \n128\n In the Buchan case, the EAT expressly hoped for guidance from an appeal court, saying \n‘These cases are increasingly common. If we have misinterpreted the law it would help us, \nthe industrial tribunals and those responsible for giving advice to have a corrective ruling as \nsoon as possible from the Court of Appeal.’ \n 653.99 Once again, this group of cases shows both the difficulties of a general and fact-\nbased definition of employee which gives rise to uncertainty and the problem of fixed or \nrigid definitions as attempted in Buchan, which could result in injustice in some \ncircumstances and manipulation in others. In terms of the justice of the case, in Bottrill \nthe Court of Appeal pointed out that Mr Bottrill had been paying NICs. Thus to \ndeprive him of his claims under ERA ‘could be to deprive unjustly that individual of \nthe benefits to which he could properly expect to be entitled after he and his \n“employer” had made the appropriate contributions’. \n3.100 The DSS has stated that there is no injustice in such a case because statutory \nredundancy pay is not a contributory benefit (although met from the National \n129\nInsurance Fund since 1990). Payment for redundancy is contingent on being an \nemployee, but not on payment of Class 1 NICs. Sometimes, directors of companies of \nwhich they are sole shareholders had been found to be self-employed and so not \nentitled to redundancy pay as described above, but not entitled to claim a refund of \nprimary or secondary Class 1 NICs because the Inland Revenue/Contributions Agency \nstill regarded them as employed earners. Despite the explanation in the DSS report, a \nmismatch between the definition of employee for employment protection purposes \nand National Insurance contribution purposes clearly gives rise to a sense of injustice. \nThose paying NICs consider that this should give them a right to social security \nprotection and do not draw nice lines in their minds between the complexities of \nentitlement to contributory and non-contributory benefits. A system that relies on such \nfine distinctions will cause confusion and not command respect or support. \n3.101 Bottrill was followed by the EAT in Smith v Secretary of State for Trade and \n130\nIndustry. The court in Smith found that the employment tribunal had erred in law in \ndeciding that an applicant for a redundancy payment was not an employee by treating \nthe fact that the applicant was a controlling shareholder as determinative of the issue \nand by not taking proper account of the fact that tax and NICs were paid on an \nemployee basis. Thus, though the Court of Appeal in Bottrill was adamant that the \ndefinition of employee was a question of fact, it has actually created a point of law in \na negative sense. If the tribunal applies a rule that a controlling shareholder cannot be \nan employee, then it can be reversed. This does not give complete certainty, but does \nprovide important guidance and, as such, is a useful development. \nLaw and fact \n3.102 In many of the above cases, there was an issue about the jurisdiction of the \ncourt to hear an appeal from the industrial or employment tribunal due to the problem \nof whether employment status was a question of law or fact. There is a strong \ntendency in the employment law cases, as in the area of tax and National Insurance, to \nresist finding that status is a question of law and to consider that classification is \n                                                                                                                                            \n129\n The DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 above, at p. 87. \n130\n [2000] ICR 69. \n 66 \nlargely a question of fact. The recent cases of Carmichael and Bottrill have reinforced \nthis approach, but, at the same time, Bottrill, together with other cases such as Hall v \nLorimer, has shown how a mixed question of law and fact can evolve from this \nprocess. \n3.103 The Privy Council has put forward the following view of the case law: \n‘Whether or not a person is employed under a contract of service is often said in the \nauthorities to be a mixed question of fact and law. Exceptionally, if the relationship is \ndependent solely upon the true construction of a written document, it is regarded as a \n131\nquestion of law: see Davies v Presbyterian Church of Wales, but where, as here, the \nrelationship has to be determined by an investigation and evaluation of the factual \ncircumstances in which work is performed, it must now be taken to be firmly \nestablished that the question of whether or not the work was performed in the capacity \nof an employee or as an independent contractor is to be regarded by an appellate court \n132\nas a question of fact to be determined by the trial court.’ \n3.104 Lord Hoffmann explained the reasons for this distinction between written \n133\ndocuments and other forms of evidence in the Carmichael case. It was considered \nessential for the development of English commercial law that questions of \nconstruction of standard commercial documents went to judges as a question of law in \norder to create precedent and certainty. One might argue that exactly the same \nconsiderations give rise to the need for status questions to be questions of law. Yet \nLord Hoffmann considered that the Court of Appeal’s attempt to deal with the \ncontract in Carmichael as a purely written contract in order to achieve this went too \nfar. The rule about construction of documents being a question of law can only apply, \nhe stated, where the parties intend all the terms of their contract (apart from any \nimplied by law) to be in a document or documents. That was not the case in the \ncircumstances of the Carmichael case. \n3.105 This can limit the extent to which appeals will be entertained. Where there is \nno document, or the document does not contain all the terms of the contract (which, \nfollowing the Carmichael approach, it seems it rarely will), it will be necessary to \nshow that the fact-finding tribunal has come to a perverse decision if it is to be \noverruled. Yet, as noted above, judges seem to have an ability to find a point of law if \nthey desire to do so, even if only in the negative sense of finding that a particular \nfactor is not determinative of the issue, which is another way of ensuring that this \nfactor is not given undue weight. The approach in the Smith case is welcome and \nshows that, though the definition of employee remains a question of fact, it is mixed \nwith questions of law. Properly developed, these legal pointers could give important \nguidance in the future. \n                                                                                                                                            \n131\n [1986] 1 All ER 705. \n132\n Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi-Keung, fn. 2 above. \n133\n Fn. 32 above. \n 67Classification case law and value added tax (VAT) \n3.106 There have been a number of cases on status heard by the VAT tribunals. For \nvarious reasons, VAT may be another factor in pushing someone towards or against \n134\nemployed status. \n3.107 The question of status arises in VAT cases because VAT is charged on taxable \n135\nsupplies in the course or furtherance of a business. It is therefore necessary to decide \nwhether the supply is made in the course of a business or as an employee. This stems \n136\nfrom the Sixth Directive on VAT, Article 4 of which states that a ‘taxable person’ is \na person who independently carries out in any place any economic activity (as defined \nin the directive). The article defines ‘independently’ to exclude employed and other \npersons from the tax in so far as they are bound to an employer by a contract of \nemployment or by any other legalities creating the relationship of employer and \nemployee as regards working conditions, remuneration and the employer’s liability. \n3.108 The general law test of whether there is a contract for services or a contract of \nservice is applied in VAT cases, which have imported the Market Investigations test \n137\ndiscussed above. A recent example of this can be found in C&E Commissioners v \n138\nHodges, in which Moss J applied reasoning and cases from general law, many from \nemployment law. He reached the conclusion that, first, the question of employment \nstatus was a question of fact and, second, that the VAT tribunal had made errors of \nlaw which tainted its decision. The matter was therefore remitted to the tribunal. \n3.109 The employment status question may not, however, determine the VAT issue \nin every case. There is a further question, which is whether the services are supplied to \nthe customer by the individual service supplier or whether the supply is actually made \n139\nby another business, for whom the individual service supplier is acting as an agent. \nIn the latter case, it would be that other business that would be making the taxable \nsupply. The two questions of employment status and who makes the supply \nsometimes seem to become entangled in the cases. These two layers of questions are \n140\napparent, for example, in a number of cases concerning agency workers and \n141\nhairdressers. It is clearly relevant to ask whether the individual service supplier is an \nemployee or self-employed, but not conclusive of the ultimate VAT position. Even if \nthey are self-employed and below the VAT registration threshold, they may be \nproviding services on behalf of the other business which is above the threshold, so \nthat VAT is payable. \n                                                                                                                                            \n134\n See Appendix to this paper. \n135\n For further details, see Appendix to this paper. \n136\n EC Council Directive 77/388. \n137\n New Way School of Motoring Ltd v Customs and Excise Comrs 1979 VATTR 57. \n138\n [2000] STC 262. \n139\n Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 above, at para. 64.19. \n140\n For example, C&E Commissioners v Reed Personnel Services Ltd [1995] STC 588.  \n141\n C&E Commissioners v MacHenrys (Hairdressers) Ltd [1993] STC 170. \n 68 \n3.110 This is often the issue in relation to hairdressers, where the salon is registered \nand will have to charge VAT if it is making the supply. If a self-employed hairdresser \nworking within the salon, but as a separate business, makes the supply direct, there \nwill usually be no VAT because the individual hairdresser is below the registration \nthreshold. Since the customer will be a private individual, not a business, so that the \nVAT cannot be recouped in any way, this becomes a significant issue. Some of the \ncases on hairdressers have found it unnecessary to deal with the issue of whether there \n142\nis a contract for services or a contract of service at all. Others have engaged with the \nquestion of whether the hairdressers are self-employed or not and applied the familiar, \n143\ngeneral tests. The end result may be, however, that the hairdresser is found to be \nself-employed for income tax purposes, but the salon is still liable for VAT in relation \nto her services because the customers are held to have contracted with the salon \n144\nproprietor rather than with the individual hairdresser. This will no doubt seem \nconfusing to those involved, but does not mean that the tribunals are applying \ndifferent tests of employment status, since the question being addressed is different in \neach case. \n3.111 Recent cases on sub-postmasters have also discussed employment status, this \ntime in a more direct way than in the hairdressing and agency cases. In Rickarby v \n145\nCustoms and Excise Commissioners, a sub-postmaster who was treated as an \nemployee for income tax and NICs purposes was found to be an employee for VAT \npurposes also and therefore not required to register for VAT. At least this showed a \ndesire for consistency for tax purposes. Unfortunately, though, there seems to be some \ninconsistency between the employment law position on sub-postmasters and VAT. \n146\nThe EAT held, in Hitchcock v Post Office, for example, that a sub-postmaster was \nnot an employee for the purposes of claiming unfair dismissal. Although there was a \nsubstantial measure of control relating to the conduct of Post Office business, the \nother circumstances, including the fact that he provided his own premises and could \ndelegate his duties to others, showed that he was not an employee. The tribunal found \nthe administrative arrangements made by Customs and Excise in relation to VAT and \nthe income tax position in the case of no ‘assistance at all’. This is an unhelpful \napproach on the part of the tribunal when the case law applied in each case, and \ntherefore the relevant factors, are supposed to be the same. It may, in part, be \nexplained by the fact that the sub-postmaster had formed a limited company to receive \nhis income from the sub-post office. It was agreed by both sides to ignore the \nexistence of the company for the purposes of the case, but its existence obviously had \nan impact on the tax situation. \n                                                                                                                                            \n142\n Customs and Excise Commissioners v Jane Montgomery (Hair Stylists) Ltd [1994] STC \n256. \n143\n MacHenrys, fn. 141 above. \n144\n D L Freer, LON/91/1069Y (7648), cited in A. Dolton and R.

It was held in \n147\nH&V Patel that a sub-postmaster is an employee of Post Office Counters Limited \nfor VAT purposes and so does not make supplies in his own right when acting as \n148\nsuch. Therefore, in this case, a partnership running a retail news agency business \ncould not reclaim input tax on a payment made to the Post Office when taking on the \nsub-post office. Hitchcock was distinguished on the facts, the Patel decision being \nbased heavily on the degree of control over all aspects of the post office business \nretained by the Post Office. This was despite the fact that the contract stated expressly \nthat it was a contract for services. Other recent cases, though, have not only treated \nsub-postmasters as not being employees for employment law purposes, but found that \nthey are not helped by the extended definitions in discrimination legislation which \n149\ncover those engaged under a contract to do work personally. This is because they \nhave no obligation to do the work personally and do have the power to delegate.  \n3.113 This is hard to reconcile with the VAT cases. Of course, each case is decided \non its own facts, but we can see from the unwillingness of the EAT in Hitchcock to \nlook at VAT and the willingness of that tribunal to ignore the existence of an \nintermediary company that the different tribunals may come to a different conclusion \non the same facts, even though the question asked is supposed to be the same one in \neach case. It seems that, whilst control is of vital importance in the VAT cases, the \nlack of obligation to do the work personally is more important in the employment law \nand discrimination cases. This can be explained on the basis that VAT is concerned \nwith the question of identifying an independent business making a taxable supply, so \nthat control is a dominant factor, whilst employment and discrimination law depend \nupon a personal relationship. \n3.114 Although the different perspectives of the two tribunals can be understood, \nthey do purport to be applying the same tests, and therefore this is a confusing \nsituation which highlights the unwillingness of tribunals in one area to be bound by \nthose in another. The case law may be to the detriment of the sub-postmaster, who \ncannot obtain employment protection, but also cannot treat the sub-post office as part \nof his business for VAT purposes. The law can hardly be said to be clear, or self-\nevidently just, in such a situation.  \nOther areas of law \n3.115 Status issues arise in many areas of law not discussed here, including \ninsurance, health and safety, personal injury cases and tort. In each type of case, it may \nbe argued that there are different policy considerations: in particular, third parties are \n                                                                                                                                            \n147\n LON/94/2821 (14956), cited in Tolley’s VAT Cases, fn. 144 above, at para. 7.90. \n148\n See also John Pugh and Helen Pugh LON/95/654 16034. \n149\n Sheehan v Post Office Counters Ltd [1999] ICR 734 (EAT) (no jurisdiction under \nDisability Discrimination Act 1995); Tanna v Post Office [1981] ICR 374 (Race Relations \nAct 1976). \n 70 \ninvolved in many of these issues but are not concerned with employment, tax or \n150\nNational Insurance law. It may be thought that total alignment of approach across \nthis wide range of cases is an impossible objective, although once again, in theory, \nthey all have the same case law starting-point to the extent that they are based on \nwhether there is a contract of service. If consistency of approach is not possible, \nhowever, then it does seem reasonable that the different policy considerations that will \nbe taken into account should be express and transparent and not a matter of guesswork \nfor litigants.  \nChapter conclusions – the future of the case law \n3.116 At first sight, the case law tests for determining the status of workers might \nseem to be outdated and too uncertain to be of real value. So, for example, the \n151\nProfessional Contractors Group (PCG) argues that ‘the “self-employment tests” \nwere not designed for businesses in the knowledge based sector but are more suitable \nfor manual or skill-based traditional businesses’. This may not take fully into account \nthe flexibility of case law and its ability to adapt to changing conditions. It has been \nsuggested that a simpler, clearer test is needed, but no one has been able to suggest a \n152\ntest that falls within this description. The variety of working patterns that exists \nmakes it impossible to devise a simple test.  \n3.117 Tests such as the number of clients/employers for whom work is done would \nbe easily manipulated if they were stated categorically and rigidly. Thus any statutory \ntest would need to list factors or badges to be considered in much the same way as the \ncase law does. It is doubtful whether statutory weights could be attached to such \nfactors, and so it may be questioned whether anything would be achieved by any such \nstatutory listing. The Tax Law Rewrite Team has concluded that any detailed statutory \n153\ndefinition would give no greater certainty than exists now.  \n3.118 It is significant that no simple statutory test has been devised in other \njurisdictions we have examined. Most of these countries have a list of factors similar \nto that in the UK. Where countries do use statutory definitions of employees or \ndisguised employees, they often utilise concepts such as dependence, entrepreneurship \nor running a business, which raise as many issues as does the use of the concept of a \ncontract of service. Nevertheless, statutory clarification of definitions for some groups \nof non-standard workers of the type discussed in Chapter 2 can be helpful and has \n                                                                                                                                            \n150\n Perrins, fn. 88 above, at para.

The UK special cases are discussed in Chapter \n4 below. ‘Safe harbours’ may also be created by legislation, which can shift the onus \nof proof and give a measure of certainty. \n3.119 The value of the case law should not be underestimated. The courts have \nshown an ability to adapt to changing work conditions in cases such as Market \nInvestigations and Hall v Lorimer. There is, however, considerable uncertainty at the \nmargins about worker classification under the case law. In practice, the courts do give \nguidance and evolve points of law as discussed above. A greater willingness to admit \nto this and to express these points as creating a legal framework, even if only in the \nnegative sense of deciding that certain factors are not determinative of the status of a \nworker, would be welcome. \n3.120 It is not surprising that the Inland Revenue has not found it easy to draw up \nsimple, yet comprehensive, guidance on the case law. The publication of the ESM is \nwelcome, but a guidance booklet, more detailed than IR56 but less overwhelming than \nthe ESM, would be desirable. Examples, as found in the IR35 guidance, would be \nwelcome. \n3.121 It can be confusing that, whilst the employment law, insurance, tort, income \ntax, VAT and National Insurance cases all appear to start at the same point and cite \nthe same authorities, the different contexts in which they are heard seems to result in \nthe development of subtly diverging case law. The assumptions and policy objectives \nof the different courts, whether they are express, as in some cases, or merely implicit, \ndo appear to affect their decisions. \n3.122 Two alternative developments could be helpful here. The House of Lords \ncould spell out that status decisions based on the same general case law without \nstatutory adaptation should not depend upon the circumstances, as has been suggested \nin the cases of Calder and Bottrill cited above. Alternatively, it could make an express \nstatement that, even though the case law starting-point is the same in different areas of \nlaw, different policy considerations in those areas may affect the outcome of a case. \n3.123 What is difficult to accept is the position we have now where there is lip-\nservice paid to common principles but the application of them differs. The effects of \nthis are masked by the emphasis of the courts on the role of fact in these cases. Status \nwill always be a factual decision in part, but, as argued above, there are points of law \ninvolved upon which the courts should be prepared to give guidance. In practice, this \nis what is occurring, even though the courts sometimes seem to play down the role of \n155\npoints of law in this area. Like the question of whether an activity is trading for tax \n                                                                                                                                            \n154\n Extra-statutory concessions may also be used to give certain groups particular treatment – \nfor example, ESC A1 in relation to expenses. \n155\n This may be a deliberate attempt to reduce appeals for administrative reasons, but this may \npay insufficient regard to the importance of guidance for the many more cases that do not \nreach the courts. \n 72 \npurposes, for example, the question of worker status is a mixed question of law and \nfact. It should be possible for the courts to develop their response to such mixed \nquestions of law and fact so as to provide a legal framework, without encouraging an \nunmanageable level of appeals. Provision of an outline framework by the courts does \nnot need to deprive the fact-finding tribunals of their important role but can give them \nmuch needed guidance. Such ‘points of law’ always have to be evaluated in the \ncontext of all the facts. A welcome development of this approach can be seen in the \napplication of the Bottrill decision in the recent case of Smith. \n3.124 It is also important that, where different conclusions appear to have been \nreached for tax and employment law purposes, but where in fact there are different \nissues being considered (for example, where for tax purposes what matters is status \nunder a short-term contract, whilst for employment law purposes it is important to \nshow a longer-term contract), this should be clearly analysed so that it is evident that \nthe law is not confused.  \n3.125 Where there are existing differences because special statutory provisions apply \nin one area, but case law continues to apply in another, as with personal service \ncompanies, the justifications for these distinctions should be considered by \ngovernment across departments. If there are different objectives, then this should be \nmade clear. If there is no good reason for the difference, then alignment should be \nconsidered. The way forward may yet turn out to be different statutory definitions for \ndifferent legal purposes in some cases to provide certainty and protection where \nneeded, against a background of the flexibility of the general law. \n3.126 Ideally, the guidance suggested above should cover other areas of law as well \nas tax and NICs. This should be a cross-departmental exercise, and areas of difference \nbetween the different types of classification should be explained as far as possible. \nSimply to state that there may be differences is to invite the view that the law is \nconfused. \n3.127 The case law tests have been given a central role under the personal service \nintermediaries legislation. The controversial nature of this legislation and the fact that \nlitigation has been threatened do suggest that a great burden will be placed on the case \nlaw tests. It remains to be seen whether the courts will be able to meet the challenge of \ntaking full account of the types of arrangement that those workers using intermediary \ncompanies are entering into, as well as giving concrete enough guidance to provide \nthe commercial certainty needed by the sectors affected by these arrangements and the \nnew legislation.  \n 73CHAPTER 4: SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS AND \nLEGISLATIVE RESPONSES \nThis chapter examines particular types of worker for whom categorisation under \nexisting case law is especially problematic. As we have seen in Chapter 2, \nworkers in these ‘problem’ categories have grown in number over the last two \ndecades and this development may continue. Examples are homeworkers, casual \nworkers, agency workers and others supplying services through an intermediary, \nconstruction workers and entertainment workers.  \nIn some, but not all, of these cases, the position is subject to express statutory \nprovisions, some of which override or bypass the case law tests described in \nChapter 3. Specific legislation and subcategories are suggested by some as a \nsolution to the problems of uncertainty and inadequacy perceived to result from \nour current case law classifications. These existing special provisions may \nprovide some guidance or raise questions on this point. They do not appear to \nremove definitional problems, though they may ease them. \nThese legislative provisions rarely apply for all purposes. This can increase the \ndiscrepancies between the tax, NICs and employment law positions of a \nparticular type of worker. The extent to which alignment of these special \nprovisions in different areas of law is desirable and feasible is also considered in \nthis chapter.  \nTypes of legislative approach to the classification problem \n4.1 There are various legislative approaches to dealing with those falling in the \n‘grey area’ of workers where classification as employed or self-employed is difficult.  \n• The workers may be treated as if they were employees for some or all purposes, \nregardless of their status under the case law (for example, agency workers).  \n• A group of workers may have a special procedure, such as deduction at source, or \nother set of rules, applied to them so that the question of employment status becomes \nless significant (for example, construction workers).  \n• A third approach, found in some modern employment legislation, is to bypass the \nconcept of employee altogether and to extend provisions to ‘workers’, defined to \ncover all or some of those in the ‘grey area’. \nNeither of the first two approaches wholly avoids the need to apply the case law tests \ninitially, to see whether the worker does fall within the ‘grey area’ subject to these \nspecial rules, but they may assist with practical issues. The third approach is more \nradical but requires a definition of ‘worker’, which could be as problematic at the \n 74 \n1\nboundaries as the definition of employee. Whilst it may work in some situations, it \nmay be too wide to be practical in others. \n4.2 Sometimes these techniques are applied in one area of law without \nconsideration of other areas. This can create distortions and confusion and increase \ncosts. We have considered above the extent to which alignment of the rules for worker \nstatus definition in different areas of law is desirable and have suggested that complete \nalignment may not be feasible due to the different objectives of the law in different \nareas. We have suggested, however, that where there are differences, these should be \ntransparent and made for clear policy reasons. Failure to look at tax, NICs and \nemployment law together may result in confusion and even cases of injustice. An \nexample of this may be found in the case of personal service companies. Taxpayers \nfalling under this regime will be treated for tax and NICs purposes as if they were \nemployees of their clients, but will gain no employee rights vis-à-vis those clients. \n2\nThis may well be perceived as being unfair.  \n4.3 The Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations 1978 (CATs \n3\nRegulations) make provision for a number of groups to be classified as employed or \nself-employed earners for NICs purposes. These classifications (for example, in \nrelation to examiners) are not adopted in any comparable tax or employment law \nlegislation and the question arises as to whether this discrepancy is necessary to fulfil \ncertain original policy objectives or for practical reasons. Even where there are similar \nregulations on categorisation (principally in relation to agency workers) for tax and \nNICs purposes, the wording is not always identical and can lead to discrepancies.  \n4.4 Other reports have noted that these discrepancies can cause confusion and a \nsense of injustice amongst groups whose status is ambiguous, particularly where such \nindividuals are unable to utilise the potential tax and NICs advantages of self-\n4\nemployed status and receive no employment protection either. This problem tends to \nbe concentrated in sectors such as agency workers, homeworking, labour-only work \nand subcontracting. \n4.5 As we saw in Chapter 3, it is still possible to be differently categorised for \nemployment law on the one hand and tax and NICs purposes on the other under \nexisting case law, even where there is no express legislation governing categorisation. \nWhere there is legislation, it would be desirable for the effect of this on other areas of \nlaw to be considered and clarified and for the literature produced for guidance of \ntaxpayers and others to make clear the relationship between the different rules. \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n The DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above. \n2\n Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, confirms this is a perceived problem.

Corden, \nSelf-Employed People and National Insurance Contributions, (1998) University of York, \nSocial Policy Research Unit for the Department of Social Security, Report no. 84.  \n 754.6 A worker will generally prefer alignment between tax and employment law \nwhere he is being classified as an employee for tax purposes. The reverse does not \nnecessarily apply. Where employment law is extended to workers who are not \nemployees, it is not always to their advantage to be classified as employees for tax and \nNICs purposes. For example, these workers will often have irregular work patterns \nthat make them unlikely to be eligible for benefits because they do not satisfy \n5\nrequirements of continuity of contributions over a certain period. The question of \nwhether status definitions should be aligned for tax and National Insurance purposes \non the one hand and employment law on the other is therefore complex.  \n4.7 Often, the individuals discussed in this chapter will have several different \nengagements over a year. Because the status determination rules apply on a contract-\nby-contract basis, they may end the year with a complicated mix of self-employed and \nemployee earnings. Sometimes, the worker may be unaware of crossing the boundary \ninto self-employment and the compliance aspects involved. The decision in Hall v \n6\nLorimer helps such workers, in that their multiple engagements may be a factor in \ndetermining that they are self-employed, but the variety of contracts that they \nundertake may still result in a mix of treatments. As a result, these workers, who are \noften lower-paid and without access to good tax advice, may have very complex tax \nand National Insurance affairs which require settlement at the year-end and they may \nbe left uncertain about their benefits and pensions position. \nSpecial cases and tax and National Insurance legislative response \nThe construction industry \n4.8 The construction sector is a prime example of an industry where the simple \noperation of case law rules on employment status has been found to be inadequate and \ngovernment has intervened to impose a special regime of deduction at source to \nreduce tax evasion. The Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) and its predecessors \n7\nhave a long history. A full history and analysis of the scheme are outside the scope of \nthis paper, but some issues arising from its development, relevant to classification, \nwill be highlighted.  \n4.9 Throughout the history of the scheme, the Inland Revenue has had the co-\noperation of the larger employers who seek to comply with tax and NICs requirements \nbut have found themselves undercut by less scrupulous competitors. The current \nscheme, introduced in August 1999, is now, however, subject to some criticism due to \nthe level of compliance cost it imposes. The Inland Revenue has set up a joint \nworking group with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions \n                                                                                                                                            \n5\n See Appendix to this paper. \n6\n See Chapter 3 above. \n7\n For the early history of this scheme, see: the Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, vol. I, \nch. 5; Harvey, fn. 21 Chapter 2 above, and papers cited there. \n 76 \nand all sections of the construction industry to examine ways in which the current \n8\nscheme can be improved. \n4.10 There have been proposals for a system of deduction at source, based on the \nschemes devised for the construction industry, but applied more generally to casual \nworkers in all sectors. Most notably, this was put forward by the Keith Committee in \n9\n1983. More recently, Lord Grabiner QC considered whether this scheme should be \nextended to other areas but concluded that it was unlikely to be suitable for other \nsectors:  \n‘Few other industries rely on sub-contracted labour to such a large extent. It is hard to \nfind other sectors where the regulatory burden on firms of a scheme requiring the \n10\ndeduction at source would not outweigh the tax compliance benefits.’ \n4.11 The administrative and compliance cost issues raised by systems of deduction \nat source from workers who are not standard employees are not the subject of this \n11\npaper but require further research. It is clear that even the construction industry, \nwhich is particularly well suited to this system, as Lord Grabiner points out, finds the \nburden heavy, and it seems unlikely that government would wish to extend deduction \nat source whilst the CIS is itself under criticism and review.  \n4.12 On the other hand, arguably, a broader system of deduction at source would be \nfairer than one targeted only on one industry sector. As always in tax issues, so on this \nquestion, ‘a government must balance the objective of fairness with the goal of \n12\nadministrative feasibility’. The new Australian PAYG system requires withholding \ntax to be deducted from any supplier of goods and service not able to provide an \nAustralian Business Number and so is not industry-specific. It will be interesting to \n13\nmonitor the operation of this scheme. \n4.13 In 1972, provision was made for deduction of tax at source from payments \n14\nmade to certain subcontractors in the construction industry. This was a reaction to \nincreasing tax evasion by labour-only subcontractors hired under the system known as \nthe ‘lump’. A contractor making payments to a subcontractor under a contract relating \nto construction operations had to deduct tax at the basic rate, unless that subcontractor \n                                                                                                                                            \n8\n Inland Revenue Budget Press Release, Construction Industry Scheme, 21 March 2000, \n[2000] STI 415. \n9\n The Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, at vol.

The sum deducted was normally paid to the Revenue on a monthly \nbasis. A subcontractor who had a satisfactory tax record might be given a certificate \nexempting him from deduction of tax. The system was subject to widespread evasion, \n15\ndespite various amendments to the legislation to improve it. \n4.14 The provisions were intended to apply only to those who were self-employed \nunder the common law tests. Thus the aim was to create a new category of ‘self-\nemployed’ subject to deduction at source. This was a specialised classification for \nsome of the ‘grey area’ workers, as we have described them in this paper. In practice, \nmany contractors operated the deduction system for their subcontractors without \nconsidering whether a worker was genuinely self-employed. Because basic rate tax \nwas being deducted at source (unless the subcontractor had an exemption certificate), \nthe loss to the Inland Revenue was arguably not very great. Subcontractors were taxed \nunder Schedule D despite having tax deducted at source and so could deduct expenses \nunder the rules for the self-employed, but many did not claim these deductions or even \n16\ntheir personal allowances and so might even have been overtaxed. This reduced the \nincentive to tax inspectors to argue that workers were employed. There was, however, \na loss in NICs collected, since the subcontractors were treated as self-employed for \n17\nthis purpose. \n4.15 There were savings to ‘employers’ if they treated their workers as self-\nemployed. Not only did they not have to pay NICs, but there were fewer other costs. \nWorkers dealt with under the subcontractors’ scheme who should have been classified \n18\nas employees lost out on benefits, training and employment law protection. Larger \ncontractors who wanted to employ their work-force directly complained that they were \nbeing undercut by those not following this course. By 1986/87, it was estimated that \nthere were over 700,000 building workers being treated as self-employed for tax \n19\npurposes. \n                                                                                                                                            \n15\n For example, exemption certificates were sold and contractors encountered difficulties in \nmonitoring the validity of exemption certificates. For further examples, see the Keith Report, \nfn. 19 Introduction above, ch. 5. \n16\n Harvey, fn. 21 Chapter 2 above, at p. 12 states that the Inland Revenue accepts that many \nindividuals were overtaxed under this regime. It is also possible that some who did not claim \nexpenses or allowances adopted this strategy deliberately since the deduction at source was at \na lower rate than they would have had to pay on their top slice of income had they filled in a \ntax return and claimed allowances. Whether this resulted in over- or under-taxation depends \non all the figures in each case. \n17\n Moreover, the business requirement that the subcontractor had to meet to be eligible for a \ncertificate entitling him to be paid gross proved capable of such wide interpretation that the \nscheme moved from a tax deduction scheme with limited exemptions to an exemption \nscheme with some limited tax deductions. \n18\n Harvey, fn. 21 Chapter 2 above. \n19\n UCATT, The Construction Industry Transition to PAYE Employment, (1998). This is a \nvery high proportion of the total number of UK businesses – for details, see Chapter 2. \n 78 \n4.16 In 1994, building industry representatives approached the Inland Revenue and \n20\nContributions Agency with concerns about employment status. Workers long \nregarded by the industry as self-employed had won cases before industrial tribunals on \nthe basis that they were actually employees for employment law purposes, and the \nindustry sought guidance for tax and NICs purposes. In co-operation with the larger \norganisations in the construction industry, the Inland Revenue and Contributions \nAgency decided to pursue more rigorously the question of whether workers were \nemployed and so not eligible to be taxed as subcontractors.  \n4.17 A leaflet was issued in 1995 for guidance (IR148/CA69) and a helpline set up. \nContractors were given until April 1997 to review the employment status of their \nworkers. It was emphasised that employment status was not a matter of choice and \nthat the same rules should be used in the construction industry as in all other \nindustries to determine whether a worker was employed or self-employed. A Tax \nBulletin article set out what contractors were expected to do and the tests they were to \n21\napply.  \n4.18 At the same time as this initiative was taking place, it was announced that the \n22\nCIS would be revised to reduce fraud in the industry. The changes involved \nrestriction of exemption certificates to more substantial businesses and the \nintroduction of mandatory registration cards for all other subcontractors. \n(Construction workers supplying services to private householders or non-construction \nbusinesses spending no more than £250,000 p.a. on construction operations are not \ncovered by these requirements.) Under the new system, anyone with no registration \ncard can only be taken on as an employee; those with registration cards are paid under \ndeduction of tax but otherwise treated as self-employed. Only those with exemption \ncertificates can be paid gross. The reforms were introduced in the Finance Acts 1995 \nand 1996, but a long lead time had to be given to enable the industry to gear up to \nthem. They eventually came into force in August 1999 after much consultation on the \n23\nnew systems and procedures and meeting with some resistance. \n4.19 The problems encountered were in part administrative: the need to ensure that \nthe appropriate certificates and cards were issued before the start of the new scheme \n(problems were reported with supply) and the requirement that certain businesses with \nexemption certificates present their card showing their photograph in person, for \n24\nexample. \n                                                                                                                                            \n20\n Inland Revenue 28 Tax Bulletin April 1997, p. 405. \n21\n Tax Bulletin, fn. 20 above. \n22\n Inland Revenue Budget Press Release, Rev 38, 28 November 1995. \n23\n See, for example, Association of Tax Technicians, New Construction Industry Legislation \nCauses Concern, 23 February 1999, [1999] STI 341 (hereafter ATT); Association of \nChartered Certified Accountants, Construction Industry Faces Tax Nightmare, 1 March \n1999, [1999] STI 370 (hereafter ACCA). \n24\n ACCA, fn. 23 above. \n 794.20 There were also problems of substance, some of which have already been met \n25\nby amendments to the scheme, but others remain bones of contention. The new \nscheme imposes stringent requirements, including a turnover requirement, for \nbusinesses to be eligible for an exemption certificate. This is intended to prevent the \nsituation that arose under the old scheme, when exemption certificates were very \nwidely available. It has been criticised as setting the turnover level too high, however, \nso that a person working on his own will rarely be able to obtain exemption. He may \nhave to pay for assistance or other expenses from pay after deduction of tax and this \ncould result in serious cash-flow problems. The increased turnover from having help \nmay eventually help him to obtain an exemption certificate, but firms require a trading \nhistory in order to obtain exemption and so could experience cash-flow difficulties \ndue to deduction of tax at source just as they start out – in any event a difficult time. \n4.21 These objections have been met in part by changes to the scheme. These \nreduce paperwork, reduce the threshold for obtaining a certificate which does not have \nto be presented in person and, from 6 April 2000, reduce the rate of deduction from \n26\nnet payment after deduction of materials from 23 per cent to 18 per cent. This last \nchange should help with cash-flow problems and ensure that personal allowances are \ntaken into account, bringing the amount deducted closer to the actual liability of \nsubcontractors than the previous deduction of basic rate tax. Nevertheless, settlement \nwill be necessary at the year-end and the scheme is very complex to operate and \nadminister, with legislation and guidance running to very many pages. \n4.22 In the run-up to the introduction of the new scheme, many workers were \nreclassified as employees, though policing the new approach has not proved easy. \nContractors on very tight margins are fearful of being undercut by competitors who \ncontinue to treat their workers as self-employed. The Inland Revenue experienced lack \nof audit resources and had to rely on competitors in the industry to report on other \nfirms that did not apply the rules. Some building workers set up intermediary \ncompanies and partnerships. These now fall subject to the personal service company \nrules discussed below. The interaction between these two sets of rules is complex and \n27\nthis route will no doubt be discouraged by the IR35 legislation. Some contractors \nbegan to use ‘internal agencies’ under their control to supply themselves with labour. \nThe 1998 Finance Act contained provisions to prevent this by applying the normal \n                                                                                                                                            \n25\n ATT, fn. 23 above. \n26\n Inland Revenue Press Release, 25 February 2000, [2000] STI 211; Inland Revenue Budget \nPress Release, 21 March 2000, [2000] STI 415. Further relaxations and reduction of costs \nthrough use of e-business were announced in the November 2000 Pre-Budget Report, IR6, 8 \nNovember 2000. \n27\n Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 373 explains the cash-flow problems that may result \nfrom falling within both the new subcontractor regime and the IR35 legislation. The Inland \nRevenue is reviewing this. \n 80 \nagency rules to construction workers, so that PAYE must be operated under these \n28\narrangements.  \n4.23 Despite the difficulties, the reclassification scheme had some success. By \n1997, 200,000 workers in the construction industry had been reclassified as \n29\nemployees. The Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency issued a joint Press \nRelease in September 1997 indicating that the number of audit visits to construction \n30\nfirms would be increased to ensure that status reviews were undertaken. In addition, \nby March 2000, 50,000 businesses were registered with the Inland Revenue of which \n31\nit had previously been unaware. Therefore the scheme appears to be tackling \nevasion. \n4.24 Nevertheless, there are some signs that, as the system settles down, there may \nstill be a tendency for some contractors to use the registration scheme as a substitute \nfor applying PAYE where workers are in fact employees. In a paper by the Union of \nConstruction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT), it is argued that some of the \nvery large number of workers (800,000) who now hold registration cards should be \n32\nclassified as employees. There are no conditions for holding a registration card, so \nthat registration does not filter out those who should properly be treated as employees \nunder the case law. UCATT points to indications in the statistics that the move from \nself-employment to direct labour has slowed down or slightly reversed since the \nintroduction of the new scheme. For example, its paper comments that the latest \nLabour Force Survey Quarterly Supplement shows an upward trend of self-\n33\nemployment in the construction sector for the first quarter of 2000. The data are not \nyet conclusive but will need to be monitored. \n4.25 It is clear from the history of the CIS that such a scheme is not without \ndifficulty. It would be very difficult to apply in a sector that did not have both strong \nunion and industry representative bodies and it might not be worth while to invest the \nwork, effort and political capital necessary to create and enforce such a scheme in a \nsmaller sector. Applying such a scheme across all sectors might have an appeal in \nterms of horizontal equity, but the administrative burden and compliance costs would \n                                                                                                                                            \n28\n Sections 55–56 and Schedule 8 of the Finance Act 1998. \n29\n UCATT, Response to the Inland Revenue Proposal for Simplifying National Insurance \nContributions for Employers, 2000 (supplied to the author by UCATT) (hereafter UCATT \n2000). \n30\n Inland Revenue Press Release 101/97, 25 September 1997. \n31\n Inland Revenue Budget Press Release, 21 March 2000, fn. 26 above. \n32\n UCATT 2000, fn. 29 above. \n33\n Labour Force Survey, Quarterly Supplement, ‘Employees and self-employed by industry \nsector’, August 2000, Table 19. The paper also cites evidence of a flattening-off of the move \ntowards employment status from the Construction Industry Training Board, Levy Assessment \nConsultation Brief, May 2000 and the DETR, State of the Construction Industry Report, \nIssue 11, April 2000, but this might be expected if status reviews took place, as was intended, \nbefore the introduction of the new scheme. \n 81be high and very careful consideration would have to be given to the costs and \nbenefits of any such extension of the scheme. \n4.26 Most significant for the purposes of this paper is the point that the CIS does \nnot avoid the need to decide whether workers are employees or not. A different tax \nand NICs regime applies to employees from that applying to registered subcontractors, \nand subcontractors will not have employment rights. There is still, therefore, both a \ntax and NICs and an employment law incentive for contractors to use registered \nsubcontractors even where the true relationship, on examination, could be said to be \none of employment. This remains a contentious issue in the industry. \nAgency workers \n4.27 Agency workers (broadly those whose labour is supplied to another on a \ntemporary basis through an employment agency) are another non-standard group for \nwhom status can be difficult to decide. From 1975, tax legislation has been in force to \nensure that agency workers who work under the supervision, direction or control of a \nclient are taxed under Schedule E rather than (as formerly) Schedule D. The agency \nworkers in question are deemed to be employees of the agency for income tax \npurposes and the agency is responsible for operating PAYE. \n4.28 Section 134 ICTA 1988 provides that the agency legislation applies for income \ntax purposes where a taxpayer provides his services to an ‘employer’ through a third \n34\nparty in such a way that technically he is not an employee of either. The basic \nconditions for section 134 to apply can be summarised as follows. The person \ncontracting with the agency must be an individual rendering personal services to the \nclient and subject to supervision, direction or control of the client or other person as to \nthe manner in which he renders those services. The individual must be supplied to the \nclient by or through a third person (not necessarily an agency) and be under an \nobligation to render those services under the terms of a contract between himself and \nthe agency. The legislation does not apply to contracts between third parties and \ncompanies, nor where workers are simply introduced to the client. The contract \nbetween worker and third party does not need to be written. The legislation can apply \neven where the worker sends a substitute to work for the client in his place. \n4.29 The aim of the legislation was to ensure that, where an agency worker worked \nside by side with permanent employees, they were not taxed on a different basis. The \npolicy reason behind the change was to maintain equity between similarly placed \n                                                                                                                                            \n34\n If there is a contract of employment between the worker and the agency, then section 134 \nwill not apply. In Secretary of State for Employment v McMeechan [1997] IRLR 353, the \nCourt of Appeal decided exceptionally that the contract between the agency worker and the \nagency was a contract of employment. However, as the Revenue notes in its Schedule E \nManual (713), ‘we do not think that many agency contracts will turn out to be contracts of \nemployment’. \n 82 \ntaxpayers, to prevent the erosion of the Schedule E tax base and to provide certainty of \n35\nstatus. \n4.30 A similar set of agency workers is classified for National Insurance purposes \nunder the Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations 1978 (CATs \n36\nRegulations) as ‘employed earners’. These Regulations cover a person who is under \nan obligation to render personal service, subject to supervision, direction or control as \nto the manner of rendering such service, where that person is supplied by or through \nsome third person and that third person retains an ongoing financial interest. The \nagency is the secondary contributor.  \n4.31 There is some inconsistency between the National Insurance and income tax \ndefinitions since the latter, but not the former, requires the existence of a contract of \nemployment between the worker and the agency, whereas the CATs Regulations \nrequire an ongoing financial interest (unlike the tax requirements). Where the agency \npays the worker, the two rules achieve the same end, but the results can differ where \nthe client pays. Alignment of these rules was mooted in a review in 1994, but this has \nnot occurred, and so the different rules can be an irritant which has no clear policy \n37\nrationale.  \n4.32 Some workers to whom section 134 and the CATs Regulations would \notherwise apply are specifically exempted; these include certain homeworkers and \nfashion, photographic and artists’ models. In the past, there was an exemption from \nthe income tax agency rules that did not apply for National Insurance purposes – for \n38\nexample, construction workers – but this anomaly has been removed. Actors, \nsingers, musicians and other entertainers are exempt from the tax charge, but not from \n39\nNICs since July 1998, so a new difference exists. \n4.33 The expressed purposes of the special agency provisions are clearly achieved \nto some extent, particularly the prevention of the erosion of the tax base. One reason \nwhy taxpayers have been using personal service companies is to avoid the operation \nof the agency rules, but this will no longer be straightforward under the IR35 regime. \nThe provisions do not, however, necessarily achieve equity as between similarly \nplaced workers. The agency workers are taxed and pay NICs as if they were \nemployees but, since for employment law purposes the test is the basic case law one \n(apart from recent legislative developments described below), they have few rights \nagainst the undertaking making use of their services. By contrast, the permanent \n40\nemployee has employment law protection. The agency workers earn rights to \n                                                                                                                                            \n35\n The Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, vol. 1, ch. 5. \n36\n SI I978/1689, discussed further at paras 4.72 et seq. below. \n37\n The DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 Chapter 3 above. \n38\n See construction workers, paras 4.8 et seq. above. \n39\n On actors and entertainers generally, see paras 4.57 et seq. below. \n40\n The DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above; DTI Press Release, \nWorkplace is No Place for Second Class Treatment, 15 July 1999. \n 83contributory benefits, but only if they satisfy the contribution conditions, which they \nmay not do if they are irregular earners. Thus they may be worse off than both their \nself-employed and their employee colleagues. \n4.34 Further, the statutory definition of agency workers does not always result in \ncertainty and consistency. There are various areas of doubt in connection with the \nincome tax and CATs agency rules. For example, it is not clear whether they include \nworkers such as professional lawyers and accountants, who may be self-employed \npartners in a genuine partnership but seconded to work in another company as a \nworker. The question of direction and control in relation to members of a profession \n41\ncan be particularly difficult. Thus some definitional problems are avoided whilst \nothers are created. \n4.35 With increasingly flexible work patterns, agencies covering a wide range of \noccupations have proliferated and created more status cases with varied circumstances \nto determine. The DSS has commented that this has injected a degree of uncertainty \nback into agency situations and this is costly and contrary to the intention of the \nlegislation. Agency workers are an expensive category of worker to determine because \nof the variety of working conditions and complex nature of the terms and engagement, \n42\nrequiring time-consuming inquiries. \n4.36 Agency workers also have an ambiguous status in terms of employment \nprotection and it can be a complex matter to determine whether they are employees or \nnot for these purposes. The mutuality obligation, which is so important for \nemployment law because of the need to show continuity of employment for some \n43\nforms of protection, gives agency workers particular problems. Agency workers have \nnow been given special status in recent employment law legislation, including the \nWorking Time Directive and Minimum Wage Act 1998. Thus, for example, section \n34 of the Minimum Wage Act provides that agency workers who are not otherwise \n‘workers’ within the meaning of the Act, because of the absence of a worker’s \ncontract between the individual and the agent, or the principal, should nevertheless be \ncovered by the minimum wage provisions. \n                                                                                                                                            \n41\n See, for example, Bhadra v Ellam 60 TC 466 (on the facts, agency doctor working for NHS \nheld to be covered by legislation as consultants had right to supervise his work, though \nactually there was little supervision). Contrast Staples v Secretary of State for Social Services \n(15 March 1985, unreported, cited in Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, at para. \n51.06); in this case, head chefs supplied on a temporary basis to a restaurant were held not to \nbe subject to supervision and so did not fall within the legislation. \n42\n The DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 Chapter 3 above. \n43\n See, for example, Wickens v Champion Employment Agency [1984] ICR 365; the DTI \nemployment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above, at para. 2.1.4. The Conduct of \nEmployment Agencies and Employment Business Regulations 1976 do require the \nemployment agency to provide a written statement indicating whether the worker is an \nemployee or independent contractor. \n 84 \n4.37 Thus it can be seen that this technique, of deeming certain workers to be \nemployees for some purposes, can serve a useful purpose. It also creates, however, \nnew boundaries to be defined and policed and the potential for uncertainty and \nperhaps injustices if it is applied in one context without consideration being given to \nother contexts. \nHomeworkers  \n4.38 As Chapter 2 described, homeworkers may be divided into ‘traditional’ and \n‘new technology’ homeworkers, the latter including teleworkers. Computers plus \ntelecommunications now facilitate the performance of work at a distance from the \nemployer. The more traditional homeworker occupations include machinists, punch \noperators, assemblers, packers and textile workers, where the capital-intensive work is \nperformed in-house and much labour-intensive work is subcontracted out. \nHomeworkers may be self-employed or employed depending on the nature of the \nrelationship between the parties. This variety of types of homeworking over a number \nof sectors would make any single approach for tax and NICs purposes very difficult. \nThere is no single industry grouping or organisation to deal with, and the most \nappropriate rules to apply may vary considerably across this heterogeneous grouping. \n4.39 It is not surprising, therefore, that there are no specific tax or NICs rules \n44\napplying to homeworkers, despite the increase in number of this group. This \ncontrasts with employment law, where there are some specific provisions for \nhomeworkers, as discussed below. The traditional homeworker, in particular, is often \nlow-paid and isolated and lacks bargaining power. It makes sense for employment \nprotection and related legislation to be extended to her. It is confusing, however, for a \nhomeworker who has little advice available to her to learn that, though she is covered \nby some employment legislation, she is not an employee for other employment law \n45\npurposes, or for tax and NICs purposes. \n4.40 From a tax and NICs point of view, there are two potential areas of difficulty \nfor the homeworker. First, in some cases it may be difficult to determine the \nemployment status of the worker because the facts point in different directions. The \nstatus may differ for tax and other purposes. Second, even where the facts are fairly \nstraightforward and the worker is clearly an employee, there may be problems because \nthe work is home-based – something not envisaged by the structure of the UK tax \nsystem. So it may be difficult to claim a proportion of household expenses, such as \nheating, lighting and telephone rental, because of the strict Schedule E expenses rules. \nIn practice, research shows that even those homeworkers classified as self-employed \n                                                                                                                                            \n44\n Except that, as explained above, homeworkers are expressly excluded from the special \nagency provisions. \n45\n The National Group on Homeworking confirms that this is a practical problem (telephone \nconversation with author). \n 8546\noften do not claim those expenses against tax. Thus, even when they are clearly \nemployees for most purposes, homeworkers may need special treatment \n4.41 In the UK, there is no special guidance literature available for homeworkers. \nThe newly published Inland Revenue Employment Status Manual (ESM) deals with \nvarious groupings under separate headings, but usually only where an agreement has \nbeen reached with a trade body or similar. The National Group on Homeworking \n47\n(NGH) has called for clear guidelines on status rulings. Although the ESM does \ncontain a wealth of detail, there is nothing expressly directed to homeworkers. A \nleaflet or other targeted guidance could be helpful, especially if it could be produced \njointly with other government departments to explain the different rules that apply, the \nimplications of different classifications and sources of advice and help.  \n4.42 Where there have been developments in the UK tax system directed at \nhomeworkers, they have been aimed at the ‘high-tech’ homeworkers, who are \ngenerally employees of large firms choosing to organise themselves in this way. It is \nto be expected that this high-profile and articulate group would be more likely to gain \nconcessions than the traditional homeworkers. For example, a limited tax relief has \nbeen introduced for computers lent to employees for home use, so that they are not \n48\ntaxed as benefits in kind, provided they do not exceed a certain value. The Finance \nAct 2000 extends the exemption from charge as a benefit in kind for accommodation \nand supplies used by an employee solely in performing the duties of the employment, \n49\nto situations where there is a private use by the employee that is not significant. This \ndeals with the practical problem facing employers in policing the solely test where \n50\nemployees use equipment at home. In both these cases, the exemptions introduced \nare limited and hedged around with anti-avoidance provisions.  \n4.43 These limited provisions will assist firms with a policy of permitting \nhomeworking, but they leave many questions uncovered and actually serve to \nhighlight the rigidity of the general rules on expenses and benefits in kind for \ntaxpayers who are employees working at home. So telephone line rental, where the \ntelephone is used for personal purposes to a significant extent as well as business \n51\npurposes, cannot be apportioned. Apportionment of other costs may also be \n                                                                                                                                            \n46\n See para. 2.32 above. \n47\n Homeworkers’ employment rights charter, reprinted in Stanworth 1996, fn. 59 Chapter 2 \nabove. \n48\n ICTA 1988 section 156 (A). \n49\n Inserted as ICTA 1988 section 155ZA. \n50\n The policy behind and operation of the new provision is described in Inland Revenue 49 \nTax Bulletin October 2000, 779. \n51\n The limited concession, which permitted some apportionment in certain circumstances (SE \n4331), has been discontinued following introduction of the more precise rules in ICTA \nsection 155ZA. \n 86 \n52\ndifficult. The Inland Revenue’s Schedule E Manual allows for deduction of costs \nwhere a room in the employee’s house is set aside exclusively for business use, but \nnot where the room has more than one use, since the expenditure cannot then be said \n53\nto be exclusively for business use. In those circumstances, only extra costs of heating \nand lighting may be claimed, but not a proportion of other expenses such as rates and \n54\nrent. Though the logic is consistent with that for deductibility of expenses under \nSchedule E generally, it has the practical consequence of penalising the less-well-off.  \n4.44 Working from home is an important model for future development and has \nmany advantages in terms of saving travel and other costs. If it is to be facilitated, this \npiecemeal and rather rigid approach to providing the necessary tax reliefs may need to \nbe reviewed. Certainly, it would be helpful for both ‘high-tech’ and ‘traditional’ \n55\nhomeworkers if the relevant rules were to be set out and explained in one place. A \nthorough review of deductibility of expenses in relation to this group, who are \nrequired or expected by their employers to work at home, would be valuable. The \nproblem for government would be that, once such a review took place for those \nworking at home, there would be pressure for a wider review of the expenses rules. To \ncreate special rules for homeworkers could be to create new distortions vis-à-vis other \ngroups. Certainly, though, special groups such as homeworkers should be taken into \naccount in any general review of expenses rules and might provide an impetus for \nsuch a review. \n4.45 Employee status is uncertain for homeworkers under employment law also. \n56\nEmployment tribunals have found homeworkers to be employees on some facts, but \nit is clear from those cases that if the circumstances had been slightly different then \nthe opposite conclusion could have been reached. Given the wide variations in the \n57\ntype of homework, the case law is of limited value as precedent. Homeworkers are \noften excluded from employment protection because of a lack of mutuality of \nobligations. Even if the worker is able to show that he was employed under a contract \nof service, to claim most employment rights he has to be continuously employed for \n58\nvarying periods of time and this may be a problem for many homeworkers.  \n4.46 These problems have led to pressure on government to broaden the scope of \nemployment protection legislation to include workers, widely defined. The NGH \nrecords as an achievement the statutory definition of homeworkers in recent \n                                                                                                                                            \n52\n See J.

The definition used is ‘an individual who contracts with a person, for the \npurposes of that person’s business, for the execution of work to be done in a place not \nunder the control or management of that person’. The definition of worker in section \n60\n54 of that Act is expressly extended in the case of homeworkers to include cases \nwhere services are not provided personally. Clearly, a homeworker may be covered by \nemployment protection legislation but not be an employee for tax and NICs purposes.  \n4.48 The heterogeneous nature of homeworkers makes it difficult to provide \nguidance to them as a group. If guidance cannot be given to homeworkers as a single \ngroup, then industry-by-industry guidance might be appropriate. A project is being \npiloted in the fashion industry. Eight government departments, including the Inland \nRevenue, Customs and Excise, Employment Service and Benefits Agency, are \n61\nworking together to ‘deliver advice and help to the industry in a seamless way’. The \nobjective is to root out fraud and provide a level playing field for businesses that do \nmeet tax, benefit and employment obligations. This co-ordinated approach could bring \nreal advantages to homeworkers and others in the fashion industry, but will obviously \nbe resource-intensive and hard to apply throughout the country. It might be helpful if \nit could be followed up with some easily accessible literature addressed to workers in \nthis industry, especially homeworkers, whose services are widely used by the fashion \nindustry, about their rights and employment status, including their tax and NICs \nposition. This might then be a model for other sectors. \n4.49 The NGH is pressing for the International Labour Organisation’s Convention \n62\non Homeworking to be ratified. This would require government to promote equality \nof treatment between homeworkers and other wage-earners in such areas as maternity \nprotection and social security protection. The UK has not ratified the Convention at \nthe time of writing, but in the future we might well see further extensions of \nemployment protection to homeworkers. If change were to occur in the employment \nlaw field, it would be helpful if there could be a review of the tax and NICs position to \nensure that there are no unintentional discrepancies. It might well be found, on \nexamination, that many members of the traditional group of homeworkers should \nproperly be classified as employees for tax and NICs purposes without the need for \nany legislative intervention. Statutory clarification of this point, and possibly an \nextension of the definition for tax purposes to match that in the National Minimum \nWage Act, could be very helpful to lower-paid homeworkers. \n                                                                                                                                            \n59\n Section 35. \n60\n See para. 4.110 below. \n61\n Customs and Excise Press Release, Innovative Project to Help the Fashion Industry, 8 July \n1999, [2000] STI 1202. \n62\n Stanworth 1996, fn. 59 Chapter 2 above, at Appendix I. \n 88 \n4.50 Government wishes to encourage teleworking, but the only existing guidance \n63\non tax classification for such workers that it is able to point to is IR56. A more \ndetailed discussion related specifically to homeworkers of this type would be helpful. \nIn addition, these new methods of working need to be borne in mind when tax reform \n64\nis being considered. \nCasual workers  \n4.51 There are three major classification problems experienced by casual workers. \nFirst, there is the question of defining employment status. Second, even if the worker \nis clearly an employee for the purposes of each separate employment, there are \nproblems with this classification since the cumulative PAYE system is not designed \nfor people moving into and out of employment. Third, the employment protection \nlegislation, relying as it does on continuity of employment and mutuality of \nobligation, is not well adjusted to casual employees. In addition to these three points, \ncasual workers are often seen as a problem in terms of tax evasion, since it is much \neasier for them to escape from paying tax of any kind than it is for those in more \nstable employment and those running an established business. \n4.52 On the first point, the employment status of a casual worker may be unclear on \nthe facts of a particular engagement because a worker who works for many different \nfirms on a casual basis may have a very different relationship with them from one who \nworks for only a few. As we have seen in Chapter 3, when discussing the decision in \n65\nHall v Lorimer, it is not only the detailed provisions of a particular engagement that \nare relevant to employment status. The worker’s personal circumstances, such as the \nnumber of other organisations to which he supplies services and whether he runs an \noffice and takes a businesslike approach to arranging his engagements, are also \nrelevant to status. This appears to be recognised by the Inland Revenue in its ESM. \nFor example, whilst part-time lecturers will normally be treated as employees, factors \npersonal to the particular lecturer, such as whether he carries on some related \nsubstantial profession or business activity, are to be taken into account in deciding his \n66\nemployment status. Nevertheless, the business to which services are being provided \nwill not necessarily know the worker’s personal circumstances and may not wish to be \ninvolved in borderline classifications. The tendency for large organisations may be to \ntreat certain types of worker as employees for tax and NICs purposes in relation to \nshort-term contracts in order to protect themselves. Other less scrupulous businesses \nmay be inclined to err in the opposite direction. Both can be difficult for the worker, \ndepending on his circumstances, but he may have little power to influence his \ntreatment by the client/employer. \n                                                                                                                                            \n63\n See para. 2.37 above. \n64\n Para. 2.20 above. \n65\n [1994] STC 23. \n66\n ESM 4502. \n 894.53 The second problem experienced by casual workers is that, even where they \nare clearly employees for tax and NICs purposes and are treated as such, they do not \nfit the cumulative PAYE system comfortably. They may have several employers in the \nrelevant period and deducting the correct amount of tax can be complex and very \ncostly in proportion to the actual payroll cost. The Keith Committee, which was also \nconcerned with the evasion problem referred to above, noted this difficulty in 1983 \nand recommended a universal scheme for casual workers involving deduction at \n67\nsource at one-half basic rate, but this recommendation was not adopted. The Bath \n68\nsurvey on compliance costs reported complaints from employers about the high costs \nof dealing with casuals. One response to this survey requested a system for casuals \nsimilar to the one used for subcontractors.  \n4.54 Special agreements have been reached with some trade bodies where there are \nmany casual employees. For example, the Association of Market Survey \nOrganisations operates a modified system of PAYE on payments made to market \n69\nresearch interviewers. This does not remove the individual’s right to claim to be \ntreated as self-employed, but, in effect, will encourage market survey organisations to \ntreat workers as employees under this scheme for the sake of simplicity. This may \npoint the way to a broader practical solution for casual employees for whom tax might \nbe deducted at a flat rate. This is clearly easier to organise, however, where there is a \nreputable trade body with which to negotiate than across the board. If the scheme were \nto be universal, it would be necessary to define and somehow register the self-\nemployed at one end and employees, who would not be part of the special scheme, at \nthe other. Thus the problem of definition would not be avoided and a registration \nprocess would be needed. We have seen the difficulties encountered with the \nConstruction Industry Scheme in this regard, in terms of compliance and \nadministration costs, though it is arguable that a universal scheme would be fairer than \nthe one we now have, which covers only one sector. \n4.55 The third problem for casual workers is that of employment law protection. \nEach short-term casual engagement may well qualify as an employment for tax, NICs \nand employment law purposes, so that tax and NICs are deducted. If each contract is \nshort-term, however, the worker may not get the full benefit of employment status for \nemployment law or benefits purposes, even if he works for one employer on many \nsuccessive occasions. The test will be one of mutuality of obligations, as we have seen \n70\nin Chapter 3. The difficulty was illustrated in O’Kelly v Trusthouse Forte, where \nregular casuals were paid weekly in arrears under deduction of tax and NICs but were \nheld for employment law purposes by the Court of Appeal to be independent \ncontractors. In O’Kelly, there was no contract of employment found to exist at all, \nthough the decision was altogether somewhat unsatisfactory. It is now more usual for \n                                                                                                                                            \n67\n The Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, ch. 6. \n68\n The Bath Report, fn. 8 Introduction above. \n69\n ESM 4220. \n70\n See fn. 45 Chapter 3 above. \n 90 \na contract of employment to be found to exist in relation to the short-term \n71\nengagement, as in Carmichael v National Power, but not a longer-term ‘umbrella’ \ncontract with that employer. Professor Hugh Collins argues convincingly that the \nemployment law problem for casuals is not that they do not have a contract of \nemployment, since they do, but that they lack the necessary continuity to establish \nqualifying periods. In his view, the answer is to use statutory techniques for extending \ncontinuity of employment rather than trying to construct ‘umbrella’ contracts. Thus, \nfor example, short periods of employment can be combined under the Employment \n72\nRights Act 1996. \n4.56 Classification may be a problem for casual workers since they may have \ncharacteristics of the self-employed but also of part-time and temporary employees. \nThey experience all the uncertainty discussed in Chapter 3 above. Even where they are \nproperly classified as employees, they do not fit easily into rules designed for \npermanent employees. They may need special treatment to take them out of \ncumulative PAYE, as found in practice in some sectors. The application of such a \nscheme to all casuals would have many definitional and administrative problems. \nConceptually, though a system of non-cumulative deduction at source might appear \nattractive, it may not give sufficient recognition to the fluidity of the work of casuals. \nAn individual may be a part-time employee at one stage, but may work in an \nindependent capacity at another, so that he is changing status frequently. A system of \ndeduction at source might make it less important to get this classification right from \nthe point of view of taxation, but it could remain important for other purposes. From \nthe point of view of employment law, it seems that, although continuity of service is a \nproblem for short-term casuals, there are existing special employment law rules which \ncan be utilised to give some measure of employment protection. \nEntertainers/actors/film and TV industry workers \nPerformers \n4.57 The categorisation of entertainers for NICs and tax purposes has long been a \nsource of difficulty. Entertainers are atypical workers, working for many different \norganisations, often at the same time. It is no coincidence that many of the leading \n73\ncases on classification concern entertainers. Nevertheless, only recently have any \nspecial categorisation provisions been introduced, and these only apply for NICs \npurposes.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n71\n See para. 3.85 above. \n72\n Collins 2000, fn. 11 Chapter 1 above. \n73\n The main cases being Davies v Braithwaite (fn. 28 Chapter 3) and Fall v Hitchen (fn. 30 \nChapter 3). \n 9174\n4.58 Following the decision in Fall v Hitchen in 1973, the Revenue took the view \nthat all standard Equity contracts were contracts of employment. Performers were not \ntreated consistently, however, and many were taxed under Schedule D. Consequently, \nmeetings were held with representative bodies and, with effect from 6 April 1990, all \nstandard Equity contracts were treated as falling under Schedule E and PAYE was \napplied. The employee was allowed a legislative deduction for certain agents’ fees, \n75\nwhich would not have been permitted under normal Schedule E rules. Attempts \nduring the 1991 Finance Bill debates to grant automatic or voluntary Schedule D \nstatus to actors came to nothing. On a purely concessionary basis, however, the \nRevenue agreed that any performer who could prove that he or she had been dealt \nwith before 6 April 1987 under Schedule D could continue on that basis indefinitely \n(known as reserved Schedule D status). Any new entrant to the profession after that \n76\ndate would now automatically be dealt with under Schedule E. \n4.59 The DSS view continued to be that the Equity standard contract was clearly a \ncontract of service, however long the engagement, because it gave very detailed \ncontrol over the performer and it required personal service to be provided. The \nRevenue’s past treatment of performers and its treatment of those with reserved \nSchedule D status were seen by the DSS as purely concessionary, aimed at simplifying \nthe collection of tax. The DSS expected the producer to deduct and account for Class \n1 NICs. Performers were content with this, since it entitled them to benefits in the \nevent of unemployment, a not infrequent occurrence for most. \n4.60 The Revenue view on the tax position was never accepted by the industry. It \nwas based on the type of contract found in Fall v Hitchen in which the taxpayer would \nperform in various productions as and when required. This differed from the position \nof many actors, who were engaged for a specific part in a particular play. It also \nconcentrated on the specific terms of the contract rather than the more general position \nof the performer in the context of his other engagements. In September 1993, the \nSpecial Commissioners ruled that live theatre work by actors Sam West and Alec \n77\nMcCowan should be taxed under Schedule D, not Schedule E. The main issue for the \nactors seems to have been the deductibility of expenses. This decision was not \nappealed by the Revenue, which accepts now in its ESM that: \n‘It is clear from these contrasting cases that the terms of the contract may not be \ndecisive by themselves and in the case of artistic workers … the way in which they \n78\ngenerally carry on their profession also needs to be considered.’ \n4.61 Though this was now the tax position, most such workers continued to pay \nClass 1 NICs and claimed employee contributory benefits. There was great uncertainty \n                                                                                                                                            \n74\n Discussed in Chapter 3 above. \n75\n Section 201A ICTA 1988. \n76\n Extra-statutory Concession A75. \n77\n Unreported; see The Tax Journal, 12 August 1993. \n78\n ESM 4121. \n 92 \non the NICs position for over two years, although revised guidance on tax status for \nperformers/artists was made public in Summer 1994. After some pressure on the \ngovernment by Equity, in July 1998 the DSS issued a Press Release stating that \nspecial regulations would be tabled to require the majority of performers to be treated \nas employees for National Insurance purposes, despite being classified as self-\n79\nemployed for tax purposes. Thus, from 17 July 1998, actors and musicians whose \nonly or main remuneration consists of salary are categorised as employees for NICs \npurposes, although the income tax position will continue to be determined according \n80\nto case law principles. \n4.62 The 1998 Press Release stated that \n‘the Government are considering the longer term position of the entertainment \nindustry in the light of the plans announced in the Chancellor’s Budget Statement \nconcerning the alignment of tax and NI and will in due course make a further \nannouncement’. \nThe 1998 amendment to the regulations was to cease to have effect on 1 February \n1999, but that cessation date was subsequently removed by further regulations, with \n81\nno new cessation date being set. \n4.63 Performers are, therefore, an example of a group of workers who may receive \nspecial treatment: self-employed status for the purposes of deduction of expenses, but \nemployee status for the purpose of NICs and of claiming contributory benefits, due to \ntheir special circumstances. At least the non-alignment of tax and National Insurance \nis express and statutory. In effect, there is a deliberate policy decision to subsidise \nfrequently unemployed performers by allowing them to claim non-means-tested \njobseeker’s allowance. This is akin to a similar decision, also a response to industry \npressure, to allow employed gas and oil divers to be treated as if they were carrying on \n82\na trade for income tax purposes. Since the normal case law tests apply for NICs \n83\npurposes, usually they will pay employee NICs.  \n4.64 Unfortunately, the special provisions for actors are not a model for other \ngroups. First, many uncertainties remain, since there is still a line to draw between \n                                                                                                                                            \n79\n P.

The \nspecial provisions do not affect employment law. Perhaps even more problematic is \n84\nthe fact that the measure is still described as interim. It would be helpful if \ngovernment could face this special situation more openly and declare that special \nprovisions had been made. The difficulty with the current situation is that a particular \ngroup with a well-organised, high-profile union has managed to obtain a ‘special deal’ \nfor its members, but other groups that might have similar claims to some form of \nhybrid treatment (such as some homeworkers, possibly) are not being afforded the \nsame opportunity. \nFilm and TV industry – behind-camera workers \n4.65 This area is an example of one where there are very detailed agreements with \nrelevant trade bodies about the classification of different types of worker. Even so, \nthere are problems and uncertainties.  \n4.66 On 30 March 1983, the Inland Revenue announced that it had carried out a \nreview of the employment status of workers engaged on free-lance terms within the \nfilm and allied industries. After extensive discussions, it had concluded that a number \nof workers engaged on free-lance terms were employees. By the end of 1983, over \n85\n7,000 workers had been recategorised as employed earners. \n4.67 The Revenue issued a note in 1994 on the application of the Hall v Lorimer \n86\ncase to the film and TV industry. In 1992, the Contributions Agency published a note \nstating that it was now instructing its staff to use the Inland Revenue’s lists as a basis \nfor identifying those most likely to be self-employed. The Inland Revenue announced \nrevised arrangements in early 1995, however, under which production companies may \npay without deduction of tax where any engagement of a person in the listed \ncategories is for less than seven days (‘the seven-day rule’). Yet the guidance notes \ninstruct the companies to apply Class 1 National Insurance to payments, even if no tax \nis deducted. \n4.68 The Film Industry Unit of the Inland Revenue has now published a list of \nspecified classes or ‘grades’ of casual and free-lance staff in the television and film \n87\nindustry who it regards as genuinely self-employed. These include advance riggers, \nanimal-handlers, editors, scenic artists, wardrobe workers and wig-makers. In order to \nqualify for self-employed status, a grade has to satisfy certain criteria, such as being \n                                                                                                                                            \n84\n ESM 4145. \n85\n Hansard, 16 January 1984, vol. 52, col. 14. \n86\n Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU), Tax \nInformation for Freelance Members, Update, August 1998.  \n87\n ESM 4101 et seq. \n 94 \n88\nnon-permanent or providing separate equipment. All workers listed are automatically \ntreated as self-employed, those not listed as employees. A worker has the right to \nobject to the Film Industry Unit and ask for a review of status. These workers have \nused service companies to deal with the classification problem in the past, though the \n89\nInland Revenue has argued that this is ineffective. Such companies will, in any \nevent, now be subject to the IR35 legislation. \n4.69 Effectively, this procedure gives the Inland Revenue a short cut to \nclassification. Given the large number of individuals involved, the wide variety of \nactivities undertaken by them in these fields and the different manners in which the \nactivities are performed, such an approach can give rise to unfairness, but for those \nclearly treated as self-employed it provides the certainty of a useful ‘safe harbour’. \n4.70 Cases continue to be brought on status in this industry, notwithstanding the \ndetailed level of guidance that has been agreed. Two National Insurance cases that \ndecided that set-construction workers in the film and TV industries were self-\nemployed have recently caused confusion because some Inland Revenue (National \nInsurance) Offices advised some companies that these decisions were of industry-wide \n90\napplication. The Inland Revenue now argues that, since these were decisions on their \nown facts only, the previous position is unchanged and generally these workers are \nemployees. Cases of doubt are to be referred to the Film Industry Unit and the agreed \n91\nstatus will apply for both tax and NICs. \n4.71 These cases show how complex the application of the status rules can be, even \nwithin one industry. If a special unit is needed to give guidance despite the detailed \nlistings agreed in this area, there is little hope that a more detailed definition of \nemployment status would solve the problems of classification, but ‘safe harbours’ can \ngive added certainty in some areas. \nThe Social Security (Categorisation of Earners) Regulations 1978 as amended \n(CATs Regulations) \n4.72 As noted above, in relation to agency workers, the CATs Regulations specify \nthat certain earners are employed earners or self-employed workers for National \nInsurance purposes, irrespective of the general position under case law. The Secretary \nof State has the power to determine by statutory instrument that certain particular \n                                                                                                                                            \n88\n For example, camera operators are accepted as self-employed if they normally provide \nsubstantial machinery; modellers are treated as self-employed if their engagement is either \nfor less than nine months or on a one-off production such as a single documentary. \n89\n ESM 4104. \n90\n Hamilton Heritage and Southbrooke Studios Ltd, both 1997 and unreported, discussed in \nInland Revenue 48 Tax Bulletin August 2000. \n91\n Tax Bulletin, fn. 90 above. \n 95groups of workers should be treated as employed or self-employed contributors and \ncan extend or withdraw the categories. \n4.73 For example, office cleaners are categorised as employees under the \nRegulations for National Insurance purposes, but the usual case law rules apply for tax \nand employment law purposes. Similarly, under the CATs Regulations: ministers of \nreligion are generally treated as employees; part-time lecturers, teachers or instructors \nare treated as employees provided a number of conditions are satisfied; examiners of \ncertain examining bodies are usually treated as self-employed; as noted earlier, agency \nworkers and actors are treated as employees. \n4.74 The rationale for these Regulations seems to be to deal with areas where it is \nperceived there has been avoidance of NICs in the past. They are also said to achieve \nequity where many workers are employees and it would be unfair for them to have to \n92\nwork side by side with workers not being treated as such. Why the same reasoning \ndoes not apply to taxation as to National Insurance is less clear in all cases, although \nwe have seen, with the example of actors discussed above, that there may be groups \nfor which a hybrid classification could be argued to be appropriate on policy grounds. \nIn the case of some of the other groups affected by the CATs Regulations, it may \nsimply be that the NICs loss is considerably more significant than the tax loss \ninvolved. For some of these groups, there are also rules drawn up for tax purposes, \neither statutory, as in the case of agencies, or some form of non-statutory guidance, for \n93\nexample as is found in relation to part-time and short-term teachers and lecturers. \nUnfortunately, even where there are rules for tax and NICs, they do not mirror each \nother, which adds unnecessary complexity. \n4.75 In practice, the Regulations often seem to achieve a result similar to that that \nought to be achieved by case law, properly applied. The purpose of the Regulations is \nin part to clarify and avoid disputes about particular categories of worker. This is clear \nfrom the fact that some workers, notably examiners, are to be treated as self-employed \nunder the Regulations. The use of special statutory definitions for clarification in this \nway can be a useful device but can also be confusing if applied for one purpose but \nnot another. \n4.76 The DSS 1994 report referred to above considered whether these Regulations \nwere obsolete, or could be simplified, or whether closer alignment with the income \ntax position could be achieved. It was acknowledged in the report that the Regulations \nwere relatively costly to administer, which does raise real questions about their \npurpose. Nevertheless, few changes were proposed. In many instances, differences \nbetween the Regulations and the tax position were thought not to be causing practical \nproblems. This does not, however, seem to be a good reason for retaining unnecessary \ndifferences. \n                                                                                                                                            \n92\n This is the reasoning given in the DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 Chapter 3 above, ch. 8. \n93\n Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, Tax Guidance: Lecturers Engaged by \nUniversities (as Agreed with Inland Revenue), 1 April 1996. \n 96 \n4.77 As a general policy matter, given the government’s desire to align tax and \nNational Insurance and following the merger of the Contributions Agency and the \nInland Revenue, it may now be an appropriate time to review the CATs Regulations \nagain and consider whether an express alignment with tax law would be helpful. \nPersonal service companies and other intermediaries (IR35) \n4.78 This section considers the issue of personal service companies in the context \nof this paper only. It does not attempt a detailed analysis of the new rules, which have \n94\nbeen the subject of many articles and other writings. This paper also does not address \nthe wider question of the incentives created by the tax system to use different legal \n95\nstructures as a medium for carrying out business. The only aim here is to analyse the \nuse of personal service intermediaries as just one of the classification difficulties \ncreated by the current structure of the UK tax and NICs system. \nThe issues addressed \n4.79 Many workers falling within the ‘problem’ categories described above, or \nother ‘grey areas’, have in the past used an intermediary through which to supply their \nservices. The intermediary has usually been a company owned and controlled by the \n96\nworker. In some industries, incorporation has been encouraged or even insisted upon \nby agencies or large firms, in order to avoid the organisation to which services are \nprovided being subject to employment legislation and employee tax and NICs \n97\ntreatment for the worker. Use of a personal service company effectively avoids the \n98\nICTA section 134 agency rules. \n4.80 In other instances, the choice to incorporate has been that of the worker. He \nmay have various reasons for this. There are tax and NICs incentives for such a \nchoice. Prior to the introduction of the new legislation, if all remuneration was paid to \n                                                                                                                                            \n94\n See, particularly, Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above. \n95\n That is, the issue of the choice of business medium as between incorporation and \nunincorporated status. From April 2001, there is to be the further choice of a Limited \nLiability Partnership (LLP) that will couple taxation as a partnership with a measure of \nlimited liability. At present, the LLP is not user-friendly for very small firms, and anti-\navoidance tax legislation is to be introduced in the 2001 Budget which may further limit its \nattractiveness – Inland Revenue Pre-Budget Report Press Release, 5, 8 November 2000. \n96\n Other arrangements are possible, such as partnerships, but are less common and less \nadvantageous. Highly artificial composite companies were also formed and marketed as a tax \navoidance scheme, which was one of the developments that led to legislation (see Redston, \nfn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 6).  \n97\n J. Freedman and M. Godwin, ‘Legal form, tax and the micro-business’, (1992) in K. Caley, \nE. Chell, F. Chittenden and C. Mason (eds), Small Enterprise Development, Paul \nChapman Publishing Ltd, London (hereafter, Freedman and Godwin).  \n98\n Inland Revenue Decision RD 4, February 1992. \n 97a personal service company owned by the worker as a gross fee, he could arrange for \nthe personal service company to pay much of this to him (and his relations) as \ndividends. Such payments were not subject to NICs and could be spread around \nfamily members to ensure that the higher rates of tax were not reached, or not reached \nas quickly as would otherwise be the case. A minimum salary could be paid to \nsafeguard contributory benefits. Some of the earnings could be retained in the \n99\ncompany at the lower corporate tax rates for companies with small profits. \nDeductions for expenses could be made for corporation tax purposes that would not \nbe permitted against a straightforward salary paid direct to the worker. Other tax \nplanning also might be possible. Savings would be made by both the worker and the \nclient and no doubt shared between them by virtue of adjustments in the price paid for \nthe job. \n4.81 In the past, generally this has been effective for tax purposes. The Inland \nRevenue has had little success in arguing that it should be able to look through the veil \n100\nof a properly incorporated company in normal circumstances. It will be noted that \nthe tax and NICs incentives of using a company are embedded in the structure of the \nsystem. The differences between taxation of dividends and remuneration, the fact that \nNICs are a charge on earnings only, the low corporate tax rate and the rigidity of the \nrules on deductibility of expenses by employees all play a part. The low corporate tax \nrate, in particular, has been introduced specifically to encourage small businesses in \ncorporate form and it is not surprising that taxpayers and their advisers should seek to \nutilise this. In addition, incorporation is encouraged by the absence of a minimum \ncapital requirement, or other barriers commonly found in other European jurisdictions, \n101\nand, now, the removal of the statutory audit requirement for many small companies. \nAgain, this is government policy and it may be thought reasonable for those providing \nservices to take advantage of this policy just as those supplying goods or engaging in \n102\nother activities may do. \n4.82 Some workers had mainly tax and NICs reasons for setting up service \ncompanies and this was particularly true of those using highly artificial composite \n103\ncompanies and other marketed schemes. These workers might properly be compared \nwith employees and it might be thought only reasonable that they should be taxed in \nthe same way as employees, on grounds of equity. Others, however, also had \n                                                                                                                                            \n99\n There are reliefs for companies with profits below certain thresholds, which will often \nbenefit personal service companies so that they have to pay only 10 or 20 per cent on their \nprofits (ICTA 1988 sections 13 and 13 AA). \n100\n RD 4, fn. 98 above, though see the Inland Revenue’s comments on service companies in \nthe entertainment industry, para. 4.68 above. \n101\n Prior to this change, many who incorporated purely for tax purposes found the costs of \nincorporation unsatisfactory – Freedman and Godwin, fn. 97 above. \n102\n For a fuller discussion of the policy of encouraging incorporation, see J. Freedman, \n‘Limited liability: large company theory and small firms’, (2000) 63 Modern Law Review \n317. \n103\n See fn. 96 above. \n 98 \ncommercial reasons for incorporation, such as obtaining limited liability or even \n104\nprestige. An entrepreneurial worker might set up a company through which to \nprovide his services for these commercial reasons, even though initially he is \nproviding services to one client only, like B in the example in Chapter 1 above. His \naim may be to develop this business and it may be unclear at inception whether this \nwill be possible. This latter type of worker should be compared with other businesses \nworking through companies and taxed on the same basis, otherwise he will be at a \ncompetitive disadvantage and may even be prevented from developing his business. \nTaxing him as an employee risks keeping him as an employee by making it difficult \nfor him to take on staff, invest in equipment and pay for training at the early stages of \n105\nhis enterprise. \n4.83 The Inland Revenue intended to target personal service companies that were \n‘disguised employees’ with its new legislation for personal service companies, \n106\noriginally heralded in the notorious IR35 Press Release and now contained in the \n107\nFinance Act 2000. Its intention was to remove opportunities for avoidance of tax \nand Class 1 NICs and to ensure that businesses employing direct labour were not put \nat a disadvantage. In part the aim was to provide a structure in which workers would \nbe more likely to return to a direct employment contract with organisations where that \n108\nwas the appropriate expression of the relationship. \n4.84 The problem the Inland Revenue has faced is the difficulty of differentiating \nbetween the two types of business described above: the genuine small business and \n109\nthe ‘disguised employee’. Much of the debate surrounding this legislation has been, \nin effect, about the problem of separating out the users of personal service companies \nwho are truly akin to employees, from those who should more properly be compared \nwith the self-employed and who are running a business on their own account. Much of \nthe anger generated by the provisions resulted from the concern of those who have \nlegally utilised incentives in the tax and business organisations system, and who \nconsider themselves to be contributing to the economy by setting up businesses, that \nthey were being described as ‘tax avoiders’. Some of this concern is exaggerated. \nSome of the people expressing concern will satisfy the criteria for running their own \nbusiness and will not be caught by the new legislation. Nevertheless, there is sufficient \nuncertainty about the application of the legislation for some on the borderline to feel \naggrieved. \n                                                                                                                                            \n104\n Freedman and Godwin, fn. 97 above. \n105\n Because tax deductions are not permitted or because, though they will eventually be \npermitted, there is a cash-flow problem due to deduction at source until the existence of a \nbusiness is established. \n106\n Inland Revenue Press Release, 35, March 1999, [1999] STI 469. \n107\n Section 60 of and Schedule 12 to the Finance Act 2000.

The new legislation does \nnothing to solve this problem, merely relying on the old case law to draw the line. The \nnew provisions operate where an individual worker provides personal services to a \nclient via an intermediary and he would, under general tax and National Insurance \n110\nlaw, have been classified as an employee of the client, were it not for the \ninterposition of the intermediary. This simply poses the old question in a different \ncontext: where there is an intermediary. By closing what the Inland Revenue sees as a \nloophole, it also removes one method that in the past has created a measure of \ncertainty within an uncertain tax scenario for those commencing in business.  \n4.86 Critics of the new legislation have claimed that it does not recognise the risks \n111\nmany entrepreneurs take when establishing their own business. The Professional \nContractors Group (PCG), set up expressly to challenge the legislation, has obtained \npermission from the High Court to proceed to a full hearing of its case for judicial \n112\nreview of the new personal service companies legislation. The government will \ncontest this. One of the PCG’s grounds is that the legislation amounts to illegal state \n113\naid as it taxes small contractors more harshly than their larger competitors. The \ncrucial question here centres on our fundamental issue. Which comparator is to be \nused – employees or the self-employed? \n4.87 Government would deny that the legislation will catch those who are actually \nrunning a business, and it is clearly not intended to, but the test is too uncertain in \napplication to be sure. What is more, the case law approach may not take into account \nsufficiently the dynamic nature of business creation: someone who is a ‘disguised \nemployee’ at one point can develop into an entrepreneur, given the right conditions. \nThe worry is that the personal service companies legislation, as applied by the Inland \nRevenue, will not be sophisticated enough to recognise this. Since it relies upon the \ncase law, it may be that it will take some time for test cases brought by organisations \nsuch as the PCG to be decided and to throw light upon how well the tests will adapt to \nthe personal service companies situation. The advantage of case law is that it can be \nflexible and, as seen in the case of Hall v Lorimer, for example, it can develop with \nchanging economic conditions. The disadvantage is that there may be lack of clarity \nfor some years whilst case law emerges. Whether the case law ultimately results in an \n                                                                                                                                            \n110\n This includes the CATs Regulations, so it is possible for a person operating through a \npersonal service intermediary to be caught by the new rules for NICs, but not income tax \npurposes – see Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 209. \n111\n Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, High Court ruling threatening IR35 tax \nplan welcomed, 11 October 2000, [2000] STI 1483. \n112\n [2000] STI 1481 et seq. \n113\n The Professional Contractors Group and Judicial Review Relating to IR35, \nwww.pcgroup.org.uk/jr-background. Other grounds are that there is a breach of the EU right \nof establishment and the legislation is disproportionate to its stated aims and a de facto \nconfiscation of property contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998. \n 100 \nadequate and sufficiently certain framework will depend upon the level of guidance \nthe courts are prepared to give, as discussed in Chapter 3 above. \nAustralia \n4.88 The UK government is by no means unique in deciding that personal service \ncompanies need to be disregarded for some tax purposes, but other techniques have \nbeen used in some other countries. A complete survey of other jurisdictions is outside \nthe scope of this paper, but it is worth noting that Australia, as part of its review of \nbusiness taxation, has this year introduced the New Business Tax System (Alienation \n114\nof Personal Services Income) Act 2000. Under this Act, personal services income \nearned by an interposed entity is included in the assessable income of the individual \nwho performed the services, but not if he is carrying on a ‘personal services business’.  \n4.89 ‘Personal services business’ is the concept that draws the line between \ncarrying on a business and supplying only personal services, and this is defined by \nlegislation. Under this legislation, there are three tests for a personal services business: \nthe employment test, the business premises test and the unrelated clients test. The \nemployment test relates to whether the worker engages others to do at least 20 per \ncent of the principal work he is paid to provide. The business premises test relates to \nwhether the worker uses and maintains physically separate business premises to \nconduct the activities that gain or produce the income. The unrelated clients test \nrelates to whether the worker has two or more clients to whom he provides services as \na direct result of offering his services to the general public or a section of the public, \nfor example as a result of advertising. \n4.90 If less than 80 per cent of the worker’s personal services income is received \nfrom one client (including associates of that client) and one of the above tests is \nsatisfied, there will be a personal services business. Even if more than 80 per cent of \nthe personal services income is from one client, it may be possible to obtain a \n‘personal services business determination’ that a personal services business exists.  \n4.91 Thus the Australians have used a different technique from the UK in attacking \nthe personal service companies problem. The case law is not relied upon as in the UK. \nThe Australian tests may seem more objective and certain than the UK tests. On the \nother hand, the Australian tests are complex and there are already several guidance \nnotes on the Australian Tax Office’s website to guide taxpayers through them. A \nnumber of definitions are still needed and there might be scope for manipulation that \nwould then have to be countered by further legislation. The operation of the new \n                                                                                                                                            \n114\n Ralph Review of Business Taxation, July 1999, www.rbt.treasury.gov.au/publications, ch. \n7; Tax News Service, 9 October 2000, p. 381; notes on alienation of personal services \nincome, www.ato.gov.au. \n 101Australian legislation, which was modelled on existing state payroll tax arrangements, \n115\nwill be interesting to monitor alongside the UK provisions. \nIR35 and employment law \n4.92 The UK legislation on personal service companies does not deem workers \ncaught by it to be employees of the organisation to which services are being supplied, \nbut merely subjects them to tax and NICs as if they were so employed. The legislation \nhas no direct impact on employment legislation. As we have seen, though, \nemployment tribunals are more willing to look through the corporate veil than are the \n116\ncourts in tax cases. The new tax and NICs treatment might encourage further \ndecisions that workers engaged through personal service companies are employees for \nthe purpose of employment protection, but there is no statutory alignment of the \nposition and the case law outcome is uncertain.  \n4.93 One of the problems with the IR35 legislation is that it leaves the possibility \nthat workers will be taxed and pay NICs as if they were employees of the client of the \nintermediary, but they will have none of the employment law advantages of actually \nbeing employed by that client. Under the proposals made by the Inland Revenue \n117\noriginally, the client would have had to deduct tax and National Insurance if the \nworker was caught by the new rules. This might have produced some incentive to take \nthe workers on as employees to avoid uncertainty, or at least would have been a \ndisincentive to laying off employees to be replaced by free-lance workers operating \nthrough personal service companies. Representations by potential client companies \nand their advisers meant that the proposal was altered to place the obligation on the \nworker. This certainly reduced costs for larger businesses and was a popular change \njudging by responses, but it does shift the compliance cost onto individual workers, \nwho may be even less well equipped to deal with it than the clients. \n4.94 Further, it means that the incentive in the original proposal for client firms to \nreturn to direct employment contracts has now largely been removed, although \nprovision of such an incentive was one of the aims of the reform expressed by the \ngovernment. Indeed, in some ways, the new rules are an incentive for businesses to \n                                                                                                                                            \n115\n By contrast, the Canadian legislation on personal service businesses incorporates the case \nlaw test of employee status. Income from personal services is eligible for fewer deductions \nthan other business income and subject to the top corporate rate of tax. J. Magee, ‘Whose \nbusiness is it? Employees versus independent contractors’, (1997) 45 Canadian Tax Journal \n584. \n116\n See, for example, Catamaran Cruisers Case Ltd v Williams, discussed in Chapter 3 above. \n117\n Inland Revenue paper, April 1999. This paper was sent only to those bodies that had \nresponded to the Budget Press Release. One criticism of the process is that this was not \nproperly published and indeed states at its head that it is not a consultation document. News \nof the paper spread, however and the Inland Revenue finally received 1,700 responses \n(Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 9). \n 102 \ninsist on always contracting through personal service companies rather than direct \nwith the individual. This is because the client business of a personal service company \nruns no risk of penalties or arrears in the event that the arrangement is reclassified. By \ncontrast, if a self-employed worker is reclassified, the client could face penalties. Thus \nthe client business can reduce its own compliance burden by paying the company \ngross and letting the worker sort matters out.  \n4.95 So individual workers might find they are required by client firms to continue \nto operate through personal service companies and they will pay the tax and NICs \ncosts of employment without the employment law benefits. In some instances, of \ncourse, they may be classified as employees by tribunals, especially if the legislation \nin question refers to workers rather than employees, but the outcome is not certain. \nThese workers could theoretically be the subject of an extension of employment \nprotection in the legislation, but the government has not indicated an intention to take \n118\nany such action. \nEffect of the legislation \n4.96 Under the original proposals, the worker would be caught if he was working \nunder the control of the client and the personal service company was not on a public \nregister of certified businesses. These proposals did not use the case law tests for \ndetermining employment status, but a rather simple and quite inadequate and outdated \ntest of supervision, direction or control. This would have been very confusing and \nwould have caught some personal service company workers who would have been \nclassified as self-employed without the existence of the intermediary.  \n4.97 Following the pressure from business described above, the Inland Revenue \naltered its proposals in September 1999, and the new provisions were enacted in the \nFinance Act 2000 and came into force on 6 April 2000. The main classification issue \nfor decision is now whether the worker would be regarded as an employee if his \nservices were provided direct to the client, rather than through an intermediary. \n4.98 If an engagement is caught by the new rules, the gross income received by the \nintermediary in respect of the engagement is treated as a Schedule E payment made by \nthe intermediary to the worker. To the extent that it has not already been paid out as \nsalary, it will be deemed to have been paid on 5 April; tax and National Insurance \n(both the employer’s and employee’s contribution, of course) will be due on 6 July \nfollowing. A deduction is allowed for employer’s NICs, expenses allowable under \nSchedule E including employee capital allowances, employer pension contributions, \nVAT and a further 5 per cent of the gross amount received after VAT to cover \n                                                                                                                                            \n118\n Statements in the parliamentary debates indicate that the intention is not to change \nemployment law; see, for example, the debates in Standing Committee H, Tuesday 6 June \n2000 (pt 7). \n 103119\nadministrative costs. Apart from the cost to the worker in terms of NICs, this can \nhave an important impact in terms of the expenses that are deductible. In particular, \nthere are complaints that training costs cannot be deducted, since the rules on \ndeduction of these for employees are very rigid. This, it is suggested, will hinder \ndevelopment of businesses, especially in the IT sector where constant training is \n120\nnecessary. The government has stated that this treatment of training costs is to put \nthose operating through personal service companies in the same position as \n121\nemployees, but of course employees are more likely to have their training funded by \ntheir employer. This means that personal service company workers may suffer a real \nextra burden. \n4.99 Estimates vary as to the costs and the impact of the new legislation. The PCG \nargues that many skilled workers are leaving the country because of the legislation, \nbut so far the evidence is anecdotal. Perhaps more systematic evidence of this and the \ncompliance costs on business will be produced at the judicial review hearing due to be \nheld in February 2001. Even the Inland Revenue, however, has estimated that the \ncosts for contractors in ‘learning the rules, consulting with advisers over the effects \nand possibly altering the terms of their contracts’ will be around £15–20 million for \n122\n1999–2000.  \n4.100 The new legislation and the response to it has led to a major review by the \nInland Revenue of its guidance on employment status and a new ESM has been \npublished on the Inland Revenue website. This will be helpful for all borderline \nworkers, not just personal service company workers. Chapter 3 above contains \ncomments on some of the points made in the ESM. The new guidance is very detailed, \nbut the large number of factors listed for consideration mainly serve to highlight how \ncomplex the area has become. Despite the accessibility of the advice, it is not clear \nthat it would be easy for a worker to make a clear assessment of his position for \n123\nhimself. There is also a new Inland Revenue leaflet and a Tax Bulletin article with \n124\ndetailed examples, both on the website. Even then, a really borderline worker could \nbe left in doubt, since the guidance can only be as clear as the case law, which we \n                                                                                                                                            \n119\n It is clearly envisaged by government that the VAT position will be unchanged by the new \nlegislation (IR35 Frequently Asked Questions). This attitude of the VAT courts remains to be \nseen. Though workers caught by the personal service intermediaries legislation are not \nemployees for the purposes of income tax law, even though they are taxed as such, the VAT \ntribunal might be prepared to look at the purpose of the VAT directives (see para. 3.107 \nabove). \n120\n A point that has been made by the PCG on its website, fn. 151 Chapter 3 above, and which \nwas also made forcibly at a Meeting of the Committee of London Society of Chartered \nAccountants and the Tax Faculty of the ICAEW (2 October 2000). \n121\n D. Primarolo, 2 December 1999, Inland Revenue website, IR35 page. \n122\n The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill 1999, Revised Regulatory Impact Assessment, at \npara. 27. \n123\n IR175. \n124\n Inland Revenue 45 Tax Bulletin February 2000. \n 104 \nhave seen is very dependent on the facts and does not cover every combination and \neventuality. \nAlternative approaches \n4.101 The discussion above raises the question of whether it would not have been \npreferable to have consulted more extensively on the personal service company \nprovisions in order to produce a narrower definition of those to be covered by the \nlegislation. New or refined tests for when the legislation should apply, such as those \nused in Australia, could have been devised. Such tests might have risked missing \nsome element of avoidance, but they could have been designed to catch cases of clear \nabuse and to provide ‘safe harbours’, leaving those attempting to set up new \nbusinesses free from the doubt that will now beset some of them. It is true that the \noriginal proposal did put forward a special test, but this was so obviously inadequate \nthat it did not test the possibilities satisfactorily.  \n4.102 Another approach might have been to tackle the problem at corporate level, \n125\nrequiring a proportion of income to be distributed as salary rather than dividends. \nThis would have had the result of dealing with this method of avoiding NICs for all \ncompany owners, not only those providing personal services. A further option would \nhave been a tax on undistributed income of close companies from some sources, as \n126\nunder the personal holding company provisions in the US. None of these approaches \nwould have been without difficulty, but they would have been worth discussion. \nInstead, such alternative options as were considered by the government had been \ndiscounted by the time the decision to legislate on this area was announced and so \n                                                                                                                                            \n125\n This approach is adopted in Belgium, where at least one director of a company claiming \nthe decreased corporate tax rate for small and medium-sized enterprises must receive a \nminimum remuneration of a certain amount which is subject to social security contributions \nand individual income tax. See C. Vanderkerken, ‘Belgian national report’, (2000) in B. \nWiman (ed.), Taxation of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, MercurIUS Stockholm \nSchool of Economics, Stockholm, at p. 68. \n126\n Section 541 Internal Revenue Code. This also covers some income other than that from the \nprovision of personal services. Various other methods are also available to the US Internal \nRevenue Service to attack personal service companies, including sections 482 and 269, which \npermit reallocation of income in some circumstances and denial of reliefs and allowances. \nSee also section 269A of the Code, which applies to personal service corporations serving a \nsingle customer and permits reallocation of income to the controlling shareholder/employee \nin some circumstances. For a discussion of these provisions, see R. Westin, J. K. McNulty \nand R. Beck, Federal Income Taxation of Business Enterprises: Cases, Statutes, Rulings, \n(1999) Lexis Publishing, New York, at ch. 13 and p. 545. \n 105there was no opportunity for public debate and sharing of experiences of other \n127\njurisdictions. \nInland Revenue guidance \n4.103 The Inland Revenue guidance provided is reasonably helpful and balanced, \nwith some exceptions as discussed in Chapter 3 above. Though it has been criticised, \nit has also been commented that its authors sometimes bend over backwards to be fair \n128\nto the taxpayer. Consultation has resulted in improvements to the guidance, so that \nHall v Lorimer is now taken into account and it is admitted that personal factors, \nwhich have little to do with the terms of the particular engagement being considered, \nmay be relevant. Even so, it might be difficult for workers who commonly operate by \ntaking a series of short-term but full-time contracts to show that they have, or will \nhave, several clients in their first year or so of operation. The snapshot nature of the \nrules may create difficulties here. \n4.104 Litigation on some borderline test cases is inevitable, given the new interest \nand importance of the status tests. Workers will be pressing for decisions that they are \nnot akin to employees. They seem likely to depend particularly on some factors that \nhave been important in recent employment law cases to deny workers employment \nstatus, such as mutuality and ability to substitute another worker. As we have seen, the \nformer of these in particular has not been important for tax purposes in the past, but \n129\nthis could change. Any such litigation could have an impact on the development of \nthe status rules generally, exerting greater pressure than before for findings of self-\nemployment. Workers who would prefer a broader definition of employment could be \nadversely affected by a series of decisions made in the context of personal service \ncompanies. Even though these will be confined to their own facts, there will be a \ntendency for them to be relied upon in court by those seeking to argue against \nemployment in other contexts. \n4.105 In an attempt to improve certainty, the Inland Revenue has now offered to \nprovide opinions on status for IR35 purposes on receipt of email, post or fax details of \n130\ncontracts and surrounding circumstances. It will aim to reply to requests for advice \nwithin 28 days of receiving all the details. This is helpful and relatively speedy for a \npublic body. It would be impractical, no doubt, for any tighter time-limit to be \nspecified. Nevertheless, this seems unlikely to satisfy totally those workers who \nhabitually operate on the borderline. The Inland Revenue will not comment on \nhypothetical contracts, but by the time the contract has been negotiated sufficiently to \n                                                                                                                                            \n127\n The Welfare and Pensions Bill 1999, Regulatory Impact Assessment. The alternatives \ndiscussed there are put up merely to be knocked down and would have been impractical: for \nexample, the outlawing of the use of intermediaries in the provision of personal services. \n128\n Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 106. \n129\n Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, at p. 108. \n130\n Inland Revenue Press Release, 7 February 2000, [2000] STI 149. \n 106 \nbe non-hypothetical there may be some urgency. Workers may not be able to wait for \n28 days for a determination, but if they agree the contract, particularly the price, \nbefore they know the tax position, they may have difficulties. Clearly, if IR35 catches \nthe engagement, the fee will need to be higher to produce the same income. The \nsetting-out of the system for written opinions as has been done is, nevertheless, \nundoubtedly helpful. This culture of willingness to give rulings and the more detailed \n131\nadvice available may be of assistance to those seeking status rulings generally.  \nPersonal service intermediaries: conclusion  \n4.106 In summary, the personal service intermediaries legislation has solved none of \nthe classification problems but has highlighted the operational difficulties of the \ncurrent case law. The increased importance of the case law may place on it a very \ngreat strain, although it may also be that the courts will eventually show the flexibility \nnecessary to develop the law to suit the new circumstances. More extensive \nconsultation would have been desirable in order to avoid spreading the net too wide in \nan area where distinctions are difficult. The new legislation, in its haste to prevent tax \navoidance, some of which undoubtedly existed, shows little understanding of the \nfragility of nascent small businesses and of their need to grow from modest \nbeginnings. It has also failed to provide an incentive to client companies to take on \nmore direct employees, again because of the rushed nature of its introduction and lack \nof comprehensive consultation with different groupings.  \nExtending employment legislation: the concept of worker \n4.107 The reaction in the field of employment law to problems about whether \nborderline workers are employees for employment protection purposes has been to \ninclude legislative extensions in the more recent Acts to ensure that a wider range of \nworkers are protected. The DTI employment status report and accompanying Press \n132\nRelease suggest that further extensions of this type will be considered. We have \nseen the value of this in our discussion of homeworkers.  \n133\n4.108 The Equal Pay Act 1970, Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and Health and \nSafety at Work Act 1974 extend the ordinary meaning of an employee to cover those \nemployed under ‘a contract personally to execute any work or labour’. Clearly, this \n134\nwill cover some self-employed workers. In Quinnen v Hovells, for example, a self-\nemployed salesman demonstrating goods in a department store was held to be covered \nby the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. \n                                                                                                                                            \n131\n As to which, see Chapter 5 below and ESM 0129. \n132\n Fn. 23 Introduction above and fn. 40 above. \n133\n Section 82(1). See also section 78(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 and section 4 of the \nDisability Discrimination Act 1995. \n134\n [1984] ICR 525. \n 107 \n4.109 In recent employment legislation, the term ‘worker’ has also been used in \npreference to the term ‘employee’. Statutes that refer to workers for at least some \npurposes include the Employment Rights Act 1996, the National Minimum Wage Act \n1998, the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, the Working Time \nRegulations 1998 and the Part Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable \nTreatment) Regulations 2000. \n4.110 For example, in the National Minimum Wage Act, worker is defined to mean \n‘an individual who has entered into or works under (or where the employment has \nceased, worked under) a contract of employment or any other contract, whether \nexpress or implied and (if it is express) whether oral or in writing, whereby the \nindividual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another \nparty to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or \n135\ncustomer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual.’ \n4.111 The burden of proof is normally on the worker to show that he is an employee, \nbut this has been reversed in the National Minimum Wage Act to place the burden on \nthe employer to demonstrate that the individual is not within the definition of a \nworker. Thus an individual is presumed to qualify for the national minimum wage \n136\nunless the contrary is established. \n4.112 Section 230(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 defines workers in a \nsimilar way to the National Minimum Wage Act, although most provisions of the \nEmployment Rights Act refer only to employees. The other provisions mentioned also \nuse a similar definition. \n4.113 Section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 confers upon the Secretary \nof State power by order to extend statutory employment rights to individuals who do \nnot presently enjoy them. The government has explained that it envisages using this \npower to ensure that all workers, other than the genuinely self-employed, enjoy the \nminimum standards of protection that the legislation is intended to provide and that \nnone are excluded simply because of technicalities relating to the type of contract or \n137\nother arrangement under which they are engaged. \n4.114 Despite this extension, it can be seen that the statutory definition of worker is \nnot free from uncertainty. It is thought that it moves away from the mutuality \nobligation, which is so problematic in employment law. It includes certain \nindependent contractors who perform work personally, but it excludes, for example, a \nperson carrying on a business undertaking. This seems to throw us back onto some of \nthe old cases on the existence of such a business and may mean that this definition of \n                                                                                                                                            \n135\n Section 54. \n136\n Section 28. \n137\n DTI, Fairness at Work, (1998) Cm. 3968, at para. 3.18 and Press Release, July 1999, fn. \n40 above. \n 108 \nworker is not, in the end, all that far away from the tax definition of employee. It has \nbeen stated that ‘the courts do not have a coherent vision, let alone definition, of what \n138\nconstitutes a business’. This may make the line between a worker and an \nindependent entrepreneur just as unclear as the line between the employed and self-\n139\nemployed. The DTI employment status report suggests that adopting the definition \nof worker will, at best, increase the number covered by employment rights by 5 per \ncent. \n4.115 As seen in Chapter 3, the requirement to do work personally is also quite \nrestrictive and means that, for example, sub-postmasters are excluded from \n140\nprotection. It has also been held that a pupil barrister is not a worker for the \n141\npurposes of the National Minimum Wage Act. \n4.116 To eliminate any uncertainty that might otherwise arise from the definition of a \nworker, the protection of the National Minimum Wage Act has been extended to two \nfurther classes of person whether or not they are ‘workers’ within the meaning of the \n142\nAct: agency workers and homeworkers. In determining for the purposes of this Act \nwhether a homeworker is a worker, section 54, cited above, has effect as if the word \n‘personally’ were substituted by ‘(whether personally or otherwise)’. Homeworker is \ndefined by section 35 of the Act to mean \n‘an individual who contracts with a person, for the purposes of that person’s business, \nfor the execution of work to be done in a place not under the control or management \nof that person.’ \nThis extension has not been applied in other recent legislation, such as the Part Time \n143\nWorkers Regulations 2000, however, despite pressure from the TUC. There is \npower to add to the protected classes by regulation ‘any individual of a prescribed \ndescription who would not otherwise be a worker’. \n4.117 There may be policy reasons that justify the use of different definitions in \ndifferent circumstances, but these justifications are not always clear and the \ndifferences can be obscure and confusing. It would be helpful if coherent guidance \ncould be published for workers about the relationship between their rights in different \nareas. The exercise of constructing such a document could highlight the areas where \nunnecessary differences existed and could be eliminated. Differences required due to \nthe different objectives of the legislation could then be made clear and transparent. \nWhere workers are paying tax and NICs as employees, there will be a sense of \ninjustice if they are not also treated as employees for employment protection purposes. \n                                                                                                                                            \n138\n D. Brodie, cited in the DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above, at p. 17. \n139\n The DTI employment status report, fn. 23 Introduction above, at p. 18 \n140\n Sheehan v Post Office Counters Ltd [1999] ICR 734 (EAT). \n141\n Edmonds v Lawson [2000] 2 WLR 1091 (CA). \n142\n Sections 34 and 35.  \n143\n Financial Times, 18 January 2000. \n 109The extension of protection to workers could assist in eliminating some of these cases, \nthough, since the definition of worker comprises that of employee and raises issues of \nits own, classification remains a problem to be dealt with, even where the term \n‘worker’ is used in legislation. \n 110 \nCHAPTER 5: LEGAL DECISION-MAKING MECHANISMS \nThis chapter examines the decision-making mechanisms used in relation to \nclassifying a worker’s status at an administrative level, as well as the system of \nappeals to tribunals and courts. The position has improved since the merger of \nthe Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue in April 1999 and the transfer \nof NICs appeals to the Tax Commissioners. Nevertheless, it is still the case that \nseveral different bodies may be concerned with determining the status of \nworkers.  \nBackground \n5.1 Employment law appeals often arise after the termination of a relationship and \nrelate to claims for unfair dismissal, discrimination and similar. Delay can be \nconfusing, create anxiety and cause financial difficulty, but the relationship is \n1\nfrequently at an end in any event, so ongoing arrangements are not affected.  \n5.2 In the case of tax and National Insurance, the position is frequently rather \ndifferent, since the taxpayer will often need to establish his status prospectively in \norder to make his arrangements and cost his services vis-à-vis the engager for the \nfuture. There can be a high cost to a person found to be an employer if he has not been \noperating PAYE in relation to the relevant employee, so some engagers will insist on \n2\ndeducting PAYE and National Insurance until a formal ruling has been obtained. For \nthis reason, administrative methods of determination are very important in this area.  \n5.3 Using a personal service intermediary may be thought to avoid this problem, \neven under the new legislation, since payments are made to the intermediary gross. \nThe rules do not affect the engager. For this reason, personal service intermediaries \nmay still be insisted upon by the client/engager to give certainty as to tax treatment for \nhimself. This does not, however, help the worker. He needs to know in advance how \nthe profits from an engagement will be treated for tax and NICs purposes, since this \nwill affect the fee he is to charge. \n5.4 The importance of an early determination of the position for tax and NICs \npurposes means that most taxpayers will need to establish their position with the \nInland Revenue, rather than taking a case to formal appeal. This increases the \nimportance of administrative methods of determination. It is likely, however, that we \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n This is not always true – for example, see the Carmichael case, fn. 32 Chapter 3 above. The \nnature of the relationship may be an issue that a trade union, for example, takes up whilst the \nrelationships between worker and engager continue to exist. \n2\n For the responsibility of an employer to deduct and pay over income tax under PAYE, see \nIncome Tax (Employments) Regulations 1993 SI 1993/744 as amended and the Appendix to \nthis paper. \n 111shall see some test cases on status going to appeal in relation to personal service \n3\nintermediaries. These may give the courts an opportunity to provide further guidance \nin the case law, as suggested above. Whether there will be an opportunity for the \ncourts to comment on the employment law situation with personal service companies \n4\nremains to be seen.  \nThe different tribunals \n5.5 Prior to the Social Security (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999, National \nInsurance status questions in England and Wales went to the Office for Determination \nof Contribution Questions, then to the Secretary of State and finally to the High Court, \nbeyond which there was no right of appeal. The appeals system for status disputes in \n5\nrelation to National Insurance was merged with that for tax in April 1999. This \nsystem remains separate from employment law, VAT tribunal and general legal \ndecisions on status. The effect of the variety of judicial processes for answering the \nsame or very similar questions on the development of the jurisprudence has been \ndiscussed in Chapter 3 above. \n5.6 Tax and National Insurance appeals in England and Wales go first to the \nGeneral or Special Commissioners and then on to the High Court, Court of Appeal \n6\nand House of Lords. The General Commissioners are laypeople; the Special \nCommissioners are legally qualified. The latter’s decisions are usually a matter of \npublic record. VAT cases on status are heard by the VAT and Duties Tribunal (where \nthere is a significant overlap of personnel with the Special Commissioners). Again, \ndecisions are published. Employment law questions are determined first by an \n7\nemployment tribunal, which is chaired by a lawyer with two interested laypeople. \nDecisions are published. There is then an appeal to an employment appeal tribunal \nchaired by a judge with two laypeople, followed by appeal to the Court of Appeal.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n3\n This has been indicated by the PCG on its website, fn. 151 Chapter 3 above. \n4\n The government envisages that VAT will be paid by personal service intermediaries and \nthat the new legislation will not affect this (IR35 Frequently Asked Questions). Many \npersonal service intermediaries will be below the VAT threshold in any event, but, for those \nthat are not, a challenge to this view might be possible. This could rely directly on the VAT \ndirectives. \n5\n As recommended by the TLRC in its Report on National Insurance Contributions Disputes, \nInstitute for Fiscal Studies, London, 1998. \n6\n In Scotland, appeals go from the Commissioners to the Court of Session. The TLRC’s \ndiscussion of and recommendations for reform of the tax appeals system can be found in \nTLRC, Interim Report on the Tax Appeals System, (1996) Institute for Fiscal Studies, London \nand TLRC, A Unified Tax Tribunals System, (1999) Institute for Fiscal Studies, London. \n7\n Formerly industrial tribunals. Sometimes cases are heard by one legally qualified person \nalone, and there have been some complaints that this is happening increasingly.  \n 112 \n5.7 The Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999 \nprovides for many National Insurance appeals to be subject to a decision by an officer \n8\nof the Board of Inland Revenue. This procedure applies, inter alia, to \n• whether a person is or was an earner and, if so, the category; \n• whether a person is or was liable to pay contributions of particular class and, if so, \nthe amount; \n• whether contributions of a particular class have been paid in respect of a period; \n• issues in connection with entitlement and other matters related to statutory sick \npay and statutory maternity pay. \n5.8 An appeal from a decision of the Board must be made in writing within 30 \n9\ndays after the issue of the decision. The appeal will then be heard by the Tax \nCommissioners and thereafter as any tax appeal.  \n5.9 The Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999 could \nnot expressly provide for decisions taken by the Commissioners on National Insurance \nmatters to be binding for tax purposes and vice versa, since the Act covers only \nNational Insurance matters. This could be problematic, even though it is the Inland \nRevenue’s intention to treat decisions on one area as relevant to the other. Status \nInspectors are advised in the ESM to arrange for appeals on tax and NICs status by the \nsame worker to be heard by the Commissioners at a joint hearing. They are told that \n‘failure to do this could result in different bodies of Commissioners coming to a \n10\ndifferent decision on status’. It is worrying that this must be avoided by relying on \nofficials making appropriate arrangements on an ad hoc basis, as it can be imagined \nthat some cases may slip through the net. It seems that conflicting status decisions \nwould still be possible on NICs and tax and it might be desirable to introduce some \nlegislative measure to prevent this. \nThe administrative approach – Status Officers  \n11\n5.10 The merger of the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue has \ntransferred the day-to-day operational functions of the Contributions Agency from the \n12\nDSS to the Revenue, which now has a duty to collect NICs. All income tax and NICs \n                                                                                                                                            \n8\n Section 8. \n9\n Section 11 of the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999. \n10\n ESM 0121. \n11\n This came into effect in April 1999 under Part 1 of the Social Security Contributions \n(Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999. \n12\n This gives statutory effect to the Common Approach which was first agreed between the \nRevenue and Contributions Agency in April 1987 in response to criticisms from business. \n 113status questions are initially decided locally, with support from Status Officers and \n13\nTechnical Support Managers based in network offices. Most Status Inspectors will \nbe part of the Employer Compliance Unit structure. They are required to handle the \n14\ncase in a consistent manner with regard to both NICs and tax aspects.  \n5.11 The Inland Revenue has a public commitment to provide guidance and, if \n15\nrequested, a written opinion on employment status. The Inland Revenue treats any \nsuch written opinion as binding, except where it can be shown that misleading \ninformation was provided or that the facts have changed. Where an earlier opinion is \ndecided to have been technically incorrect, the Inland Revenue normally expects to be \n16\nbound by it for the past, but will seek to alter it for the future. These written opinions \n17\nare not formal decisions and carry no right to appeal. \n5.12 The ESM makes it clear that opinions by officials of the Board of Inland \nRevenue on tax and NICs status should be the same unless there is an express \n18\ndifference between them as a result of the CATs Regulations or other special \nprovisions (see Chapter 4 above). There could also be a lack of uniformity because the \nquestion being asked in each case is actually a different one (for example, the question \nfor NICs purposes may be whether the person is an earner at all, rather than whether \n19\nhe is employed or self-employed). Whilst this point is not unreasonable in itself, the \nstatement in the ESM that opinions about NICs in such cases need not mention \nincome tax treatment is less than helpful, since the taxpayer could be left very \nconfused.  \n5.13 The statement of the Inland Revenue’s commitment to give rulings, now \nclearly set out in the new ESM, is helpful. There are two main problems. First, there is \nno deadline for the giving of a status opinion. Second, the Inland Revenue will not \n20\ngive a firm opinion about status before a worker has commenced work. It is clear \nwhy the latter point is made, since otherwise a taxpayer or engager could keep \nsubmitting contracts with adjustments until obtaining the desired opinion. On the \nother hand, it will be difficult to agree pricing and other details without knowing in \nadvance how the Inland Revenue will treat the contract. \n                                                                                                                                            \nThe intention was to have closer operational alignment by providing for specific procedures \nto be followed by both departments when considering enquiries about employment status.  \n13\n ESM 0102. \n14\n ESM 0104. \n15\n ESM 1001. \n16\n ESM 0112. \n17\n ESM 0107. \n18\n ESM 0002. \n19\n ESM 0126 – although in such a case there would be a similar question to be decided for \nincome tax purposes relating to the source of income and whether it was income or capital. \n20\n ESM 0129. \n 114 \n5.14 In relation to the new personal service intermediaries legislation, the Inland \nRevenue has said that it will aim to reply to any requests for advice within 28 days of \nreceiving all the details. A written contract, or written details of an oral contract, must \nbe submitted and the Revenue will still not comment on hypothetical contracts, which \npersonal service intermediary owners argue is unhelpful, but there is evidence of an \n21\nInland Revenue aim to give as much advance guidance as possible. It has \ncommented on a version of a model contract, though emphasising that the opinion \n22\ngiven on this contract was in relation to one person’s particular circumstances. \n5.15 The 28-day guideline applies in general to Inland Revenue correspondence and \nso to all requests for written opinions, whether or not related to the new legislation, \nbut there is no guarantee that the 28-day time-frame will be adhered to, especially in \nmarginal cases with complex facts. The 28-day time-limit can easily be overridden by \nthe Status Officer seeking more information. A mandatory time-limit would probably \nbe impractical, since further information often will be required and these decisions are \nnot straightforward. On the other hand, delay can cause real hardship for the worker \nand additional compliance costs for all parties. It would be desirable for some time-\nframe to be referred to, at least for guidance, in the ESM, as it is for IR35 cases. At the \nmoment, the ESM does not appear to refer to any time-limits at all. The fact that the \nRevenue has felt able to provide a time-frame in relation to personal service \ncompanies suggests that similar clearance procedures subject to time-limits may be \npossible in other areas. It would seem unreasonable for status enquiries to be dealt \nwith more quickly for those with personal service intermediaries than for those less-\nsophisticated taxpayers who are supplying services directly. \n5.16 In the past, there has been no statistical data available about the number of \napplications for status opinions or the time taken to respond to them. There was \n23\nanecdotal evidence of delay causing hardship and a measure of evidence from the \n24\nAdjudicator of some hard cases.  \n5.17 It seems that some data are now being compiled about status enquiries, at least \nin relation to the personal service intermediaries legislation. It was reported in \n                                                                                                                                            \n21\n Inland Revenue Press Release, [2000] STI 149. \n22\n IR35 Frequently Asked Questions. \n23\n This comment is made as a result of anecdotal evidence from Equity, TaxAid and others. \nSee also frequent queries on status in the pages of Taxation – for example: July 1999, p. 435 \non workers being reclassified in a haulage business; the detailed article in 25 November \n1999, p. 184 on reclassifying part-time workers in the security industry: ‘There were \nsubstantial delays in correspondence. During the four year period at least five different \nInspectors of Taxes dealt with the case.’; 11 March 1999, query on subcontractor \nreclassification; 28 January 1999, query on subcontractor status; 27 March 1997 at pp. 757 \nand 758, where a worker in the film industry was given a different status from his colleagues \nin the same occupation putting him at a competitive disadvantage. \n24\n For example, Case CA9, 1998 Inland Revenue Adjudicator’s Annual Report and Case A7 \nInland Revenue Adjudicator’s Annual Report 1995. \n 115Hansard in June 2000 that over 1,200 contracts had been submitted to the Inland \nRevenue under the new IR35 procedure. Fifty-three per cent had been found to be \n25\nwithin the new legislation, but 47 per cent were outside it. This has been taken to \n26\nindicate an even-handed approach, although it may just be that taxpayers who are \nclearly self-employed have been made unduly nervous by the publicity over the new \nlegislation, so that contracts were being submitted where there was obviously no \nquestion of being caught by the legislation. If statistics can be compiled in relation to \nthe new legislation, then it is hoped they will also be kept in relation to written \nopinions on status given in cases of direct supply of services. \n5.18 Publication of these statistics as well as examples of recent opinions given by \nthe Inland Revenue might be of some assistance in ensuring that the case law is \napplied consistently by the Revenue across all districts and as a way of monitoring \ndecisions. It has already been suggested that more examples should be included in \nbooklets produced for the taxpayers. It would need to be made clear that this was \npurely guidance and could not set any precedents. \n5.19 Where the worker does not accept the informal, non-appealable written \nopinion of the Inland Revenue under the above procedure, the next step is to move to \n27\na formal procedure. The Inland Revenue will make a formal decision under section 8 \nof the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999 in relation \nto NICs. A formal appealable status decision on income taxation involves the issue of \na determination under Regulation 49 of the Income Tax (Employments) Regulations \n28 29\n1993 on the engager. As mentioned above, administrative arrangements are in place \nto require that all disputes involving NICs and income tax status are referred to a \nnominated Status Officer in the Tax Office before a formal decision or determination \n30\nis made, to ensure a co-ordinated approach to status disputes. \nChapter conclusions \n5.20 It can be seen that, despite the merger of the Inland Revenue and the \nContributions Agency, complete merger of status opinions has been difficult. There \nare some areas where the law is different, or slightly different questions are being \naddressed. An opinion of a court in one area does not officially bind in respect of the \nother. There is an awareness of these problems and it is hoped that they will be dealt \nwith administratively, though this needs to be monitored. \n                                                                                                                                            \n25\n HC 6 June 2000, cited in Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above, p. 120. \n26\n Redston, fn. 47 Chapter 3 above. \n27\n The procedure is set out in the Inland Revenue 41 Tax Bulletin June 1999. \n28\n SI 1993/744. \n29\n ESM 0121. \n30\n Tax Bulletin 41, fn. 27 above. \n 116 \n5.21 Given these problems within a merged organisation, a single status appeals \nbody across all areas, including employment law, does not seem to be a practical \noption. The variety of contexts in which the issue of status arises and the statutory \nvariations and additional tests to be applied in some cases would mean that even one \ntribunal might come to different decisions on similar facts. Delay would be created if \ncases had to be adjourned to a status tribunal before there could be a full hearing of \nthe issues. Guidance from the higher courts, as suggested in Chapter 3, seems a more \nrealistic option, but an objective of total consistency between different areas of law is \nillusory. \n5.22 The merger of the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency has brought \nsome important improvements and the Common Approach should now be easier to \nachieve. This is dependent, however, upon administrative guidelines since \ntheoretically conflicting decisions could be reached by different bodies of Tax \nCommissioners on tax and NICs. This seems unfortunate.  \n5.23 There is evidence in the new ESM and from the way in which personal service \nintermediary inquiries have been handled that the Inland Revenue is attempting to \ngive prompt and balanced advice. It is difficult to lay down formal deadlines for what \nis an informal administrative procedure, but a practice statement about time-limits for \nresponses would assist taxpayers in this area where time can be very important. It \nwould be regrettable if resources were put into dealing with high-profile personal \nservice intermediaries’ requests for opinions, but standard inquiries from those \nsupplying services direct and their engagers were not dealt with so promptly. \n5.24 Publication of statistics and examples of written opinions could do much to \ninstil confidence, provide guidance and facilitate monitoring of the Inland Revenue’s \nsystem of dealing with status issues. \n 117CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS, ISSUES FOR \nFURTHER CONSIDERATION, QUESTIONS AND WIDER \nISSUES FOR RESEARCH \nSummary of analysis \n6.1  A number of questions arise from this paper and some suggestions can be \nmade for further research and discussion. As made clear above, these questions and \nsuggestions do not represent TLRC proposals, but are intended to stimulate debate. \nComments are welcome on the paper and particularly on the points raised below. Any \nrd\ncomments should be sent to Judith Freedman, c/o The TLRC, IFS, 3 Floor, 7 \nRidgmount Street, London, WC1E 7AE. \n6.2  The central issue examined in this paper is worker classification. As discussed \nin the Introduction, reforms in this area alone cannot remove the difficulties created by \ntax and NICs differences in treatment between the employed and the self-employed. \nThis would require more radical change, which is considered briefly under ‘Wider \nissues for future research’ below. Some improvements could be made, however, by \nincreasing certainty of worker classification and making special statutory provision for \nparticular groups of workers. \n6.3  Chapter 1 describes the spectrum of workers and shows that, whilst at each \nend of the spectrum there are clear differences between the employed and self-\nemployed, so that different tax and NICs treatment may be appropriate, there are also \nworkers in the ‘grey area’ at the borderline of the classification divide. The proper \ntaxation and NICs treatment of these workers may be less clear. There are also \nworkers falling obviously on one side of the classification divide or the other for \nwhom the tax and NICs treatment applicable to that classification seems \ninappropriate, due to some special characteristic of that group of workers. \n6.4 Chapter 2 examines the evidence on changing work patterns and considers the \nimplications of this for the rules on tax classification. There are more non-standard \nworkers than previously. The majority of businesses in the UK are sole traders or \npartnerships without employees, a number of whom will be ‘grey area’ workers. \nGovernment wishes to encourage entrepreneurship, but the evidence on work patterns \nand businesses in existence shows how difficult it is for governments to target tax \nreliefs and incentives to benefit certain types of business it considers to be \n‘entrepreneurial’ to the exclusion of others. There are statutory attempts being \nintroduced to distinguish ‘genuine businesses’ from ‘false self-employment’ in many \njurisdictions, but this is a very difficult line to draw. Businesses may start small, with \nonly one client, and develop, or they may remain service only providers, which are \nmore properly described as ‘disguised wage-labourers’. It may be hard to draw a line \nbetween them at the outset, but discriminating between them for tax and NICs \npurposes may inhibit commercial development. Chapters 2 and 3 refer briefly to \nattempts in some other jurisdictions to deal with this problem. \n 118 \n6.5 The fast-growing group of homeworkers is examined. Traditional \nhomeworkers must be distinguished from teleworkers and others using new \ntechnology to work at home. Both groups may need special consideration in relation \nto tax and NICs policy (as they have had under employment law). Development of \npolicies for the new technology homeworker need to take taxation issues into account: \nsome special allowances and rules may be required to adapt taxation rules to this new \nway of working. \n6.6 Chapter 2 shows how the increase in all types of non-standard work puts \npressure on the case law system of classification of workers by increasing the number \nof workers on the border. Even where classification is not an issue, the rules \ndeveloped for standard workers may be less appropriate for the increasing number of \nnon-standard workers. Examples are cumulative PAYE and the expenses rules. \n6.7 Chapter 3 considers the UK case law on employment status and compares the \napproach of the courts in income tax, National Insurance, VAT and employment law \ncases. This examination suggests that a new statutory definition of employment or \nself-employment would be little improvement on the case law test. Most countries \nhave multi-factorial tests, as does the UK. A simple, objective test would be too rigid \nand arbitrary and open to manipulation. The case law has in the past shown the \nflexibility to meet changing conditions. The courts also have the scope to lay down a \nlegal framework, which could give a level of certainty in this area. On occasion, they \nhave been prepared to do this in the past, but a greater willingness to express points as \nmixed questions of law and fact, rather than claiming that the issues before them are \nones of pure fact, could be helpful. This could become even more important in the \ncontext of the pressure on the case law that results from the new personal service \nintermediaries legislation. \n6.8 Certainty could also be improved by the use of statutory devices, as has \noccurred in some other jurisdictions and, to some extent, the UK. Some statutory \napproaches are discussed in Chapter 4. These include treating workers as if they were \nemployees for some or all purposes (for example, agency workers, actors, persons \nsupplying services through personal service intermediaries), applying a special \nprocedure to certain workers, such as deduction at source within the construction \nindustry, and bypassing the concept of employee altogether by extending provisions to \n‘workers’. Chapter 4 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of special statutory \ntreatment for these and some other groups. It also shows that problems of \nclassification are not necessarily avoided by statutory provisions. New definitional \nissues, or old ones in a new form, may arise. It is difficult to escape the need for the \nconcepts of employee and of running one’s own business or enterprise. \n6.9 Chapters 3 and 5 discuss the problem of differences in the treatment of worker \nstatus in different areas of law. Alignment in all areas might not be possible or even \ndesirable, especially if different policy objectives are being pursued. Where the case \nlaw to be applied is supposedly identical, however, it is confusing and unfortunate if \nthe jurisprudence in different areas of law develops in different ways. Chapter 5 \nexamines decision-making mechanisms for the classification of workers for tax, \n 119National Insurance and employment law purposes. It welcomes the fact that status \ndecisions for tax and National Insurance are now heard by the same tribunal. It would \nseem impractical to extend this to all types of status decision, but courts need to be \nclear about the principles they are applying and the reasons for applying those \nprinciples. Statutory divergencies also need to be based on different policy objectives, \nrather than arising from chance or the failure of different government departments to \nprovide a co-ordinated approach. Chapter 5 also considers administrative guidance \nand decision-making on tax and NICs classification issues. \nIssues for further consideration and questions \nIncreased judicial guidance and willingness to lay down points of law \n6.10 Rigid judicial or statutory weightings of factors would not be possible, nor \ndesirable, due to the variety of fact situations and working patterns. In recent years, \nhowever, there have been some indications that courts are prepared to make \nstatements and findings, which have been valuable in providing subsequent guidance. \nThe treatment by the courts of employment status as a mixed question of law and fact, \nand not pure fact, is important for the development of consistency in this area. The \ncourts have the scope to create guidelines appropriate for modern conditions and there \nare some welcome indications that they are willing to do this. This development \nwould not necessitate the undermining of fact-finding tribunals nor the encouragement \nof large numbers of appeals from those tribunals, which would be administratively \nunwieldy. It is, rather, a call not to be over-ready to treat questions as pure questions \nof fact, but to be prepared to intervene in order to provide consistency in application \nof the factors relevant to worker status. \n[See Chapter 3 generally and especially paragraphs 3.2–3.6, 3.102–3.105 and \n3.119] \nComments are invited on whether development of more points of law in this area \nis seen as possible and helpful. \nUse of statutory extensions to cover particular groups \n6.11 The tax system could extend and tailor its definitions of employees and the \nself-employed, as has been done in employment protection legislation that extends \nprovisions to ‘workers’. In the area of taxation, agency workers are already treated as \nif they were employees. Actors are treated as employees for NICs purposes but self-\nemployed for tax purposes. This is a technique that could be considered in relation to \nother non-standard workers. \n6.12 It would be very difficult to provide in detail for all possible varieties of non-\nstandard workers through extended definitions, and such a multi-classification \napproach has to be balanced with administrative feasibility. The more classifications \nthere are, the more boundary lines there are. This could increase uncertainty. On the \n 120 \nother hand, multi-classifications may be necessary if the tax system is to deal fairly \nwith the complexities that exist as a matter of economic reality. \n6.13 Statutory definitions can be tailored to meet the special requirements of \nparticular groups, remove doubt and shift the burden of proof. For example, many \nhomeworkers who wish to be treated as employed for NICs purposes, in order to be \nentitled to benefits, and for employment law protection purposes have difficulty in \npersuading their clients/employers to treat them as such. Often they would be \nemployees on a proper application of the case law but are not treated as such due to \npractice in the industry. They may have little bargaining power or understanding of \nhow to challenge their treatment. A definition like that in the National Minimum \nWage Act 1998, making it clear that homeworkers satisfying certain conditions were \nintended to be treated as employees by tax and NICs legislation, would be helpful to \nthem. This technique has been used for some categories in the CATs Regulations for \nNICs purposes, but it could be further used and extended to cover taxation. An \nalternative would be to treat homeworkers as employees for NICs purposes and self-\nemployed for tax purposes, as in the case of actors, since they may have some \nexpenses which would be deductible under Schedule D and not Schedule E. \n[See paragraphs 4.27 et seq. (agency workers), 4.38 et seq. (homeworkers), 4.57 et \nseq. (entertainers and actors) and 4.72–4.75 (CATs Regulations)] \nComments are invited on whether further statutory extensions of the definition \nof employment in particular cases would be helpful and, if so, in what areas it \nmight assist and for which purposes. \n‘Safe harbours’ to carve out certain groups \n6.14 A related device to increase certainty is a ‘safe harbour’. An extra-statutory \nexample of this can be seen in the case of specified grades of staff in the film and \ntelevision industry who are listed by the Inland Revenue as self-employed. This \nincreases certainty for those covered, provided it is binding on the Inland Revenue. It \ndoes not alter the law, being only an application of the law as the Inland Revenue \nperceives it, but it can provide helpful guidance. It will be much easier to give \nindustry-specific ‘safe harbours’ of this kind than general ones, given the varieties of \nwork practices and facts that may exist. \n[See paragraphs 4.68–4.71] \n6.15 In practice, those using personal service companies had attempted to create \ntheir own ‘safe harbour’: a device that would make it unlikely that they would be \nargued to be employees of their clients. This has now been prevented by the new \npersonal service intermediaries legislation. Arguably, this ‘taxpayer-made safe \nharbour’ was too wide, but some modified version could be considered. The concerns \nfelt over the burden being placed on the case law test of employment status by the new \n 121legislation could be eased by the addition of some legislative or extra-statutory ‘safe \nharbours’. \n[See paragraphs 4.78 et seq.] \n6.16 The Australian personal services income legislation defines personal services \nbusiness, which is exempt from the operation of the legislation. The definition seems \ncomplex and possibly susceptible to manipulation, but its operation should be \nmonitored, alongside the operation of the UK personal services legislation, so that \ncomparisons can be made.  \n[See paragraphs 4.88 et seq.] \n6.17 Simple ‘safe harbours’ risk being manipulated, whilst more complex ones add \nto compliance and administrative costs and may not increase certainty since they bring \ntheir own definitional difficulties. At the same time, they may provide valuable \nguidance and assurance to taxpayers. A layered approach could be devised. This could \nbe based on the existing case law test to give flexibility but be overlaid with some \nmore objective guidance measures. For example, it could be provided that a worker \nwould not be caught by the personal service intermediary legislation if he received \nless than a certain percentage of relevant income from any one client. The percentage \ncould be set low, because anyone not satisfying this test would still be able to argue \nthat he was not caught by the legislation due to the operation of the normal case law \ntest. This would not alter the law, therefore, but it would clearly and definitely take \nout some obvious cases who would not need to consider the application of the case \nlaw test. \n6.18 It might be argued that this would add complexity for no real gain, since the \npersons protected would be self-employed under the case law tests in any event. The \nlevel of uncertainty and anxiety generated by the introduction of the new legislation \nmay settle down after a year or so of operation. To introduce new tests would only \nunsettle matters again. These are valid objections which might suggest that the \noperation of the legislation should be monitored. If the Inland Revenue is receiving \nlarge numbers of queries on particular sets of facts, it could be found helpful to create \n‘safe harbours’ to carve out some of these cases, leaving the general guidance \nprocedure to deal with only more equivocal cases. The ‘safe harbours’ could be \ncreated by legislation or, possibly, Inland Revenue practice statements. If ‘safe \nharbours’ are introduced, arguably they should apply to workers engaged directly by \nfirms as well as to those operating through intermediaries, to provide a level playing \nfield. \n6.19 In the past, the Institute of Directors has suggested that workers should be \n1\ngiven a choice as to their employment status for tax and NICs purposes. This would \nbe unacceptable on grounds of revenue loss and lack of equity, for the reasons \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n Discussed and rejected in the DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 Chapter 3 above. \n 122 \nexplained in this paper. Not only would those opting for self-employment generally \npay less tax and NICs than if they were employees, but they might have a greater \nopportunity to evade tax, since it would not be deducted at source. It is also \ninconceivable that an election would be acceptable in relation to employment law. For \npublic policy reasons, contracting out could not be permitted. In its latest report on \n2\nthis area, the Institute of Directors does not propose this election. \nComments are invited on whether safe harbours could be helpful to increase \ncertainty in relation to the personal service intermediaries legislation or any \nother area. If so, should they be statutory, as in Australia, or would extra-\nstatutory statements be adequate? \nRelationship between tax, National Insurance law and employment protection \nlegislation \n6.20 Tax law and employment law have very different objectives. Tax law concerns \nthe relationship of the taxpayer with the state and seeks to ensure that he pays a fair \nshare of taxation, in a way that is administratively practical and efficient. Employment \nlaw is generally about providing the worker with appropriate protection and \nsafeguards and his relationship with his employer/client. There may be good reasons \nfor different definitions of employee to be adopted in these different situations. This \ncan, however, cause compliance costs and confusion. For example, a worker may be \ndefined for tax purposes as Schedule E and have to pay Class 1 NICs, but be held not \nto be an employee for certain employment law purposes (perhaps because of the \nmutuality factor). If he is dismissed, he may be able to claim jobseeker’s allowance \n(based on his Class 1 contributions and subject to his contribution record) but be \nunable to claim unfair dismissal, because he is not an employee for this purpose, or at \nleast not one with sufficient continuous service.  \n[See paragraphs 3.81 et seq. and A28–A31] \n6.21 Variations in definition of who is to be covered by different pieces of \nlegislation may be statutory. They may also arise, however, as described in Chapter 3, \nbecause the courts sometimes purport to be applying case law tests derived from the \nsame authorities but, in practice, emphasise different factors. Employment tribunals in \nparticular may take a purposive approach to interpretation of legislation. It is not \npossible to be certain that an employment tribunal will reach the same conclusion on \nstatus as a tax tribunal, even if the test is apparently the same one in each case. On \nappeal, the higher courts may be reluctant to overturn a decision based largely on an \ninterpretation of the facts.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n2\n IOD paper 1998, fn. 17 Introduction above. This paper does propose what it calls a separate \nentity approach, which has some similarities to an election, as a way of escaping alignment \nproblems, but the idea is not worked through and is stated without much conviction. \n 1236.22 Two alternative developments could be helpful here. The House of Lords \ncould spell out that status decisions based on the same general case law without \nstatutory adaptation should not depend upon the circumstances. This would help to \nreduce emergent divergencies in the jurisprudence. Alternatively, it could make an \nexpress statement that different policy considerations may affect the outcome of a case \nand clearly delink the development of tax and employment law. The former approach \nwould have the advantage that policy differences would be left to the legislature to \nspell out, but the latter might be thought necessary to ensure that full effect is given to \nlegislation intended to be protective and to remove irrelevant considerations from both \nareas. Whichever route is taken, it needs to be transparent and clear to users. What is \ndifficult to accept is the position we have now, where there is lip-service paid to \ncommon principles but the application of them differs. \n6.23 These divergences in application in different areas of law  are masked by the \nemphasis of the courts on the role of fact in the worker classification cases. Greater \nwillingness to lay down points of law, as suggested above, would assist in this area. A \nwelcome development of this approach in the area of employment law can be seen in \nthe application of the Bottrill decision in the recent case of Smith, discussed in \nparagraphs 3.97–3.101 above. \n6.24 Where there are differences between taxation and employment law because \nspecial statutory provisions apply in one area but case law continues to apply in \nanother, the justifications for these distinctions need to be considered by government \nacross departments. If there are different objectives, then this needs to be discussed \nand clearly stated. If there is no good reason for the difference, then adoption of the \nspecial statutory provisions should be considered across all areas.  \n6.25 The new legislation on personal service intermediaries is an example of an \narea where action has been taken on taxation and NICs without full discussion of how \nit affects, or fails to affect, employment law. As a result it is possible that taxpayers \nwill pay tax and NICs as if they were employees of the client company, but not benefit \nfrom most forms of employment protection vis-à-vis that client. They will normally be \nemployees of the personal service company itself, but the weight that would be placed \non the existence of the company by an employment tribunal is unpredictable. The veil \nmight be lifted, as in Catamaran Cruisers, bringing employment law into line with \ntaxation, but this would depend upon the employment tribunal’s perception of the \nfacts, and it is not known what, if any, account it would take of the tax and NICs \nposition. If the personal service company became insolvent, an employment tribunal \ncould decide, on the facts, that the worker was not an employee of that company at all. \nIf he was also not an employee of the client, he would receive no redundancy pay. It is \nnot clear that there is a coherent policy at work here, and an interdepartmental strategy \nwould be desirable in the interests of clarity, certainty and justice. \n[See paragraphs 3.94–3.101, 3.116–3.127 and 4.92–4.95] \nComments are invited on the discrepancies between tax and National Insurance \nlaw on the one hand and employment law on the other. To what extent, if at all, \n 124 \nare practical problems and injustices created by any statutory and non-statutory \ndifferences? Is it agreed that the above steps, if taken by the courts and \ngovernment, would be helpful? \n6.26 Under the new arrangements for administration and appeals, tax and National \nInsurance will now normally be in line as a matter of case law, though this was not \nalways so in the past. There are areas of statutory difference, however, created by \ndifferences between the CATs Regulations and the equivalent taxation provisions \ncovering areas such as agency, for example. These discrepancies were considered by \nthe relevant government departments prior to merger and it was concluded that the \nproblems did not warrant action at that stage. Given that there has now been a merger \nof the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue, however, it may be an \nappropriate time to review the discrepancies again and bring the provisions into line. \nThere may be some areas where the difference between tax and NICs is maintained, as \nwith actors, but this should be a policy decision rather than a failure to act. There may \nbe groups of workers other than actors and divers who should be considered for this \nspecial treatment of being self-employed for tax purposes (so that they may deduct \nexpenses) and employees for NICs purposes (so that they may be eligible for \njobseeker’s allowance). \n[See paragraphs 4.63–4.64and 4.72] \nComments are invited on the question of alignment between tax and National \nInsurance and whether any practical problems are created by current \ndiscrepancies. \n6.27 The fact that NICs appeals will now be heard by the Tax Commissioners is \nwelcome, but the legislation should make it clear that a ruling by the tax tribunal is \nbinding for both tax and National Insurance purposes, whether or not both are \nexplicitly addressed at the hearing (unless there are statutory differences or the issue in \nquestion is a different one). At present, there remains a risk that different bodies of \nCommissioners will reach different decisions in tax and NICs appeals, although \nadministrative arrangements are in place to try to avoid this. \n[See paragraph 5.9] \nComments are invited on any practical experience of differences in approach by \nthe Inland Revenue to tax and NICs and on whether a legislative provision as \nsuggested would be practical and helpful. \nGuidance to be given by the Inland Revenue and other government bodies \n6.28 In view of the complexity of the case law and statute on classification of \nworkers, it is not surprising that the Inland Revenue has not found it easy to draw up \nsimple yet comprehensive guidance on the case law. The publication of the \nEmployment Status Manual (ESM) by the Inland Revenue on the internet is welcome, \n 125but a guidance booklet, more detailed than IR56 but less overwhelming than the ESM, \nwould be desirable. Examples, as found in the IR35 guidance, would be welcome. \nIdeally, this guidance should cover other areas of law as well as tax and NICs. The \ndrawing-up of such guidance should be a cross-departmental exercise and areas of \ndifference between the different types of classification should be explained as far as \npossible. Simply to state that there may be differences is to invite the view that the law \nis confused. \n6.29 Industry-based guidance on status of the type available to television and film \nworkers would be particularly helpful. This could build on the current project being \npiloted in the fashion industry, which involves eight government departments, and \ncould give advice on employment protection as well as tax and National Insurance. A \nbooklet to give guidance to groups that commonly have little access to advice, such as \nhomeworkers, would be particularly welcome.  \n[See paragraphs 3.39 et seq., 4.41 and 4.50] \nComments are invited on the type of written guidance that might be found useful \ngenerally. Suggestions for any groups or sectors that might require specially \ntailored guidance are also welcome. \n6.30 The formalisation and clarification of the operations of the Status Officers for \ntax and NICs purposes are welcome. A useful further development would be the \nsetting-down of a definite (though probably extra-statutory) time-frame for the giving \nof written opinions on employment status for general tax and NICs purposes, as has \nbeen done in relation to the personal service intermediaries legislation. Publication of \nmore statistics and examples of status opinions might also be helpful. \n[See paragraphs 4.105 and 5.13–5.18] \nComments are invited on the usefulness and practicality of the suggestion for a \ntime-limit for status opinion requests. Does experience suggest that unreasonable \ndelays are occurring in obtaining opinions either in relation to personal service \nintermediaries or more generally on worker status issues? Would publication of \nexample status opinions be considered a helpful way of monitoring the giving of \nstatus opinions and providing guidance to taxpayers? \nWider issues for future research \n6.31 There are inherent differences between the employed and self-employed at \neach end of the worker status spectrum. It would not be possible or desirable to \nsubject those at each end of this spectrum to identical rules for calculating, paying and \ncollecting taxation and NICs. The rules could theoretically be brought closer together \nin some respects, however, and the level of NICs for the employed and self-employed \ncould be more closely aligned. These questions have been alluded to, but not fully \nexamined, in this paper. \n 126 \nNational Insurance \n6.32 The problem of equity between the employed and self-employed raises \nfundamental issues about the National Insurance system, its contributory foundations \nand its move, in practice, towards being a pure tax. As noted in the Introduction, this \nis a topic now attracting a good deal of attention, and it requires further work in this \ncontext, as well as more widely.  \n[See paragraphs 0.13–0.17] \nCumulative PAYE and absence of universal tax returns \n6.33 The constraints imposed by the cumulative PAYE system and the fact that \nonly a minority of taxpayers complete a tax return are also topics of great importance \nthat require further research. Suggestions for alignment of rules on deductibility of \nexpenses, for example, are likely to be met with the response that allowing employees \nto make a large number of deductions would be impractical and inconsistent with a \nsystem of cumulative PAYE in which only a minority of employees complete a tax \n3\nreturn. Further work is needed on the desirability and practicality of the cumulative \nPAYE system for the future and on whether there would be benefits to be gained by \nincreasing the number of taxpayers required to make tax returns or even making this a \n4\nuniversal requirement, as in other jurisdictions. It must be noted, however, that \ncurrent government policy relies upon delivering credits through the pay-packet and \nthis policy objective would seem to be in conflict with a move away from cumulative \nPAYE and towards universal tax returns. \n[See paragraphs 0.18–0.20] \n                                                                                                                                            \n3\n For alternative approaches to dealing with the expenses problem, see Freedman and \nChamberlain 1997, fn. 2 Introduction above, at p. 112. \n4\n As the Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, noted in 1983, the UK is out of line with \nother countries in not having universal tax returns (though note that in some other \njurisdictions there is joint taxation of spouses so that not all individuals actually fill in a \nreturn). The report accepted that there were resource problems with moving to 100 per cent \ntax returns. There are also problems with the complexity of current UK tax returns. \nNevertheless, as self-assessment settles down, this could be the time to investigate the \npotential benefits of more widespread tax returns. Not least, there is an argument that \ntaxpayers should have more knowledge about their own tax affairs than they do now and the \nachievement of this aim would be assisted by requiring tax returns. See, generally, D. Hole, \n‘An annual tax return for all: problems and benefits’, (1998) in D. Hole and J. Millar, \nOptions for the UK Tax Return System, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, York. \n 127Non-cumulative deduction at source \n6.34 One linked issue that does arise rather more directly from this paper, though it \nis also related to the way in which tax collection is administered, is that of deduction \nat source from non-employees. The proposal of the Keith Committee in 1983 to \ndeduct tax at source from casual workers generally on a non-cumulative basis has \nbeen mentioned above. It has not met with enthusiasm in the UK, being rejected most \nrecently in Lord Grabiner’s report on The Informal Economy, as discussed in \nparagraphs 4.10–4.11 above. \n6.35 The UK does, however, have a complex system of deduction at source from \nnon-employees for the construction industry (the CIS). The industry has many \ncomplaints about the burdens imposed by this system and it seems unlikely that \ngovernment would wish to extend deduction at source from non-employees whilst the \nCIS is facing criticism. On the other hand, arguably, a broader system of deduction at \nsource could be more acceptable and less discriminatory than one targeted only on one \nindustry. The new Australian PAYG system requires withholding tax to be deducted \nfrom any supplier of goods and services not able to provide an Australian Business \nNumber (ABN) and so it is not industry-specific. \n6.36 The Australian scheme is similar to that proposed by the Keith Committee \nunder which tax would be withheld from every worker who could not produce a VAT \n5\nnumber. VAT registration would not be adequate for such a scheme to operate in the \nUK, since VAT registration has a high threshold. Various alternative registration \nschemes for the self-employed have been proposed but have not met with much \n6\nsupport in the past. Generally, requirements to register businesses have been reduced \n7\nin recent years as a deregulatory measure. Following the Grabiner Report, new \nbusinesses in the UK will now have to register their existence with the Inland \n8\nRevenue more promptly than previously and this will be enforced by penalties. But a \nsystem that required all persons receiving gross payments to provide a business \nnumber might not be politically acceptable and might be considered obtrusive and too \nheavy in compliance costs. On the other hand, once workers became used to such a \nrequirement, it might be found acceptable. It would be valuable to monitor the \nAustralian scheme and compare it with the UK CIS.  \n                                                                                                                                            \n5\n The Keith Report, fn. 19 Introduction above, at para. 6.3.4. The ABN is also used for goods \nand services tax purposes in Australia. \n6\n The National Federation of the Self-Employed proposed a scheme under which registration \nwould be conclusive of self-employment (referred to in Smith and Thomas 2000, fn. 91 \nChapter 3 above, at p. 13). \n7\n For example, the Business Names Register no longer exists and a Customs and Excise \nconsultation paper on public access to the VAT Register published in 1995 was not \nenthusiastically received. \n8\n Inland Revenue Press Release, Help for New Businesses Registering for the First Time, 17 \nOctober 2000, [2000] STI 1492. \n 128 \n6.37 A general requirement to deduct tax at source would, however, not avoid \nclassification problems. The ABN is available only to those carrying on an enterprise, \nwhich must be defined. As we have seen with the CIS, deduction at source from non-\nemployees does not remove the need to differentiate them from employees if the level \nof withholding tax is different, or if the employees and the non-employees pay \ndifferent rates of NICs. Employment status would also continue to be important for \nsome employment protection purposes. Deduction at source would be a measure \naimed largely at preventing tax evasion rather than removing classification problems. \nIt could be costly in terms of both administration and compliance. It would bring a \nmeasure of alignment but leave many problems unresolved. \n[See paragraphs 3.14 and 4.8–4.26] \nNeutrality between legal vehicles for business \n6.38 The use of personal service intermediaries and the legislation designed to \ncounteract this are just one consequence of the lack of tax and NICs neutrality as \nbetween different legal vehicles for business. This lack of neutrality has much wider \nimplications, which go far beyond the scope of the current paper. The problem may be \nincreased by the introduction of the Limited Liability Partnership, which combines the \ntax treatment of a partnership with the commercial advantage of a measure of limited \nliability. The fact that different business vehicles are taxed differently makes it \ninevitable that taxpayers will take taxation into account as a factor when considering \nwhich business medium to use. Giving reliefs and allowances to those trading through \none business form and not to others will increase the incentive to do this. Attempts by \ngovernment to provide incentives for some types of business, which it perceives to be \n‘genuine’, but not to others are likely to be very difficult to target. Attaching reliefs to \nparticular business forms, such as companies only, will increase the incentive for all \ntaxpayers to incorporate. Government may then try to counteract the use of \nincorporation by those it had not intended to benefit. Personal service intermediaries \nand the legislation designed to counteract them are an example of this somewhat \ncircular approach. A thorough review of the relationship between taxation of different \nlegal forms would go far wider than the personal service intermediaries problem but \nmight provide a result preferable to piecemeal and operationally difficult legislation \ndesigned to tackle only one outcome. \n[See paragraphs 2.11, 4.84, 4.101 and 4.102] \n6.39 These wider issues require further work and monitoring. In the mean time, the \nissue of classification of workers will continue to be one of importance and worthy of \nattention.\n 129APPENDIX: DIFFERENCES IN TREATMENT BETWEEN \nEMPLOYED AND SELF-EMPLOYED \nA1 This Appendix sets out some of the main differences in treatment between \nemployed and self-employed workers for tax, National Insurance and employment law \npurposes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive treatment of any of these areas, \nbut outlines some of the major differences so that the importance of classification of \n1\nworkers can be understood for the purposes of this paper. \n2\nTax \nComputing income \nA2 There are significant differences in the method of computing income as \nbetween the employed and self-employed. Employees are taxed on their ‘emoluments’ \n3\nunder Schedule E of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA), whilst \nself-employed traders and professionals are taxed on their ‘profits’ under Schedule D, \n4\nCases I and II. Emoluments and profits are conceptually different and there are \nfundamental differences in the method of calculating these two forms of income. A \ntaxpayer may be both employed and self-employed simultaneously in respect of \ndifferent sources of income. In such a case, taxation on the income from each source \n5\nwill be calculated entirely separately since the Schedules are mutually exclusive. \nA3 Emoluments are generally wages or salary and bonuses, with the addition of \nbenefits in kind, which were brought into charge initially by case law and thereafter by \n6\nlegislative provisions. Payments are usually received on a regular basis and the main \nissues revolve around special payments, such as signing-on and termination payments \n7\nand benefits. They are taxed when they are received or become due. Profits have to be \ncalculated from a starting-point of the accounting profits, so as to give a true and fair \nview, with some adjustments for tax purposes. The cash basis is no longer permitted \neven for professions, so an accruals basis is required for all (with the exception of \n8\nbarristers and advocates in the early years of practice). Clearly, calculation of such \n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n The differences are also discussed in Freedman and Chamberlain 1997, fn. 2 Introduction \nabove. \n2\n For more detail, see Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above.  \n3\n Section 19 ICTA 1988; Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, ch. 6. \n4\n Section 18 ICTA 1988; Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, ch. 7. \n5\n IRC v Brander and Cruickshank [1971] 1 All ER 36. \n6\n Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, at paras 6.39 to 6.117. \n7\n Sections 202A and 202B ICTA 1988. \n8\n Section 42 of the Finance Act 1998, qualified by section 43. The adjustments are those \n‘required or authorised by law in computing profits for those purposes’. It is clear that there \nare areas governed by statutes, such as depreciation, which is governed by the capital \n 130 \nprofits will need to be retrospective and take place at the end of some fixed period. \nOnly revenue expenses may be deducted from Schedule D and Schedule E income, \nexcept for those deductions permitted under the capital allowances regime. \nA4 Much discontent has focused on the differences in the rules on deductibility of \n9\nexpenses for the purposes of income tax. The expenses rules are generally considered \nto operate more harshly in relation to employees, who cannot deduct general expenses \nunless they are expended ‘wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of \n10\nthe employee’s duties’. This wording has been construed strictly and objectively by \n11\nthe courts and is also applied strictly by the Inland Revenue. For example, employees \nare often not permitted to make deductions for their own expenses of working at \n12\nhome, training courses and books to keep themselves updated. Travel expenses are \nrequired to be incurred necessarily in the performance of the employee’s duties or to \n13\nsatisfy statutory tests relating to travel to temporary workplaces. Employees’ capital \nallowances are similarly restricted to those for machinery and plant wholly, \n14\nexclusively and necessarily provided for use in the performance of the employment. \nA5 By contrast, the self-employed have fewer conditions for deduction, having \nonly to show that money was laid out or expended ‘wholly and exclusively for the \n15\npurposes of the trade or profession’. The words ‘wholly’ and ‘exclusively’ are found \nin both the Schedule E and Schedule D provisions and are strictly construed in both \n16\ncontexts. Nevertheless, the additional words in the Schedule E test have resulted in a \nstricter, more objective, test for employees. The difference in effect of these two \nprovisions may be greater in practical application than on paper. In particular, the \napproach to apportionment of certain types of expenses seems more relaxed in the \n17\ncase of the self-employed.  \n                                                                                                                                            \nallowances code. It is less clear whether and to what extent this provision is subject to case \nlaw principles: see Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, at pp. 317 et seq. \n9\n See the Codification Committee, Report of the Committee on Codification of Income Tax \nLaw, (1936) Cmd 5131, HMSO, London; Radcliffe Committee, fn. 17 Introduction above; \nInstitute of Taxation, Representations on the Form and Administration of the Taxation \nSystem, (1989) IOT, London. (For a recent proposal, see IOD paper 1998, fn. 17 Introduction \nabove.) \n10\n Section 198 ICTA 1988. \n11\n For example: Roskams v Bennett [1950] 32 TC 129; Brown v Bullock [1961] 3 All ER 129; \nSmith v Abbott [1994] 1 All ER 673. \n12\n This is a particular problem for employees whose work requires them to maintain or \nincrease specialist knowledge. In 1955, the Radcliffe Committee, fn. 17 Introduction above, \nch. 5 commented on the special problems of employees with professional status; this group \nhas now widened, as more workers need specialist knowledge and skills. \n13\n Section 198 (1A) ICTA 1988. \n14\n Section 27 of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 (cars and cycles are an exception). \n15\n Section 74 (1) (a) ICTA 1988. \n16\n Mallalieu v Drummond [1983] 2 AC 861. \n17\n Freedman 1996, fn. 52 Chapter 4 above. \n 131A6 There are some instances in which employees may be more leniently treated by \nthe tax regime than the self-employed – for example, under the rules for travel \n18\nexpenses. Some benefits in kind are also expressly provided to be tax-free on policy \n19 20\ngrounds – for example, use of workplace nurseries and sports facilities – and these \nadvantages are not available to the self-employed. For the most part, however, \nbenefits in kind are caught, and the tax payable on cars provided by the employer, for \nexample, has now increased to a level where employees often prefer to take a higher \nsalary rather than the car. A self-employed person may often make deductions in \nrelation to some or all of the costs of a car used in the business. It is sometimes stated \nthat rules on pension contributions are more generous to employees than to the self-\n21\nemployed, but the reverse can also be true, and some differences are inevitable, \ngiven the different types of pension provision, their complexity and the important \npolicy considerations related to them. Much depends on the type of provision an \nemployer is prepared to make, which is partly, but not entirely, influenced by tax \nrules, and on the pattern of the worker’s career. \nA7 It is important not to exaggerate the tax benefits of the self-employed. Some of \nthe perceived advantages may be the result of the self-employed making deductions \nthat are not permitted by law but that are not picked up by the Inland Revenue because \nnot all accounts of self-employed taxpayers can be scrutinised. Employees have their \ntax payments on benefits policed by their employers and claims for deduction of \nexpenses will be unusual and so carefully scrutinised. Even when the law is applied \nstrictly, though, there is greater flexibility in deduction of expenses for a self-\nemployed person and a sense of injustice amongst those employees who do incur non-\n22\ndeductible expenses. \nDifferences in income tax collection methods and timing  \nA8 The different nature of the tax base for employees and the self-employed in \npart dictates the method of collection and timing of taxation. The method of \ncollection, in its turn, influences the substantive rules. The strict rules on expenses for \n                                                                                                                                            \n18\n Introduced in Finance Act 1998. \n19\n Section 155A ICTA 1988. \n20\n Section 197G ICTA 1988. For other exceptions to the charge on benefits in kind, see \nsection 155 ICTA 1988 and Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, at para. 6.99. \n21\n IOD paper 1998, fn. 17 Introduction above. \n22\n A particular sense of injustice may also be felt by employees who have related Schedule D \nbusiness. They may find that they cannot deduct expenses under Schedule E for the reasons \ngiven above, but that they are also denied a deduction under Schedule D because they use the \nequipment on which the expenditure is incurred for the purposes of their employment as well \nas their Schedule D activity, so that it is not ‘wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their \ntrade’ (Mitchell and Edon v Ross [1962] A.C. 813). This is another consequence of the \nSchedules being mutually exclusive, as discussed in para. A2 above. \n 132 \nemployees, for example, are important in a system that attempts to collect tax from \nemployees without requiring a tax return from them, in the majority of cases. \nA9 In most systems, employees are taxed at source under a flat rate withholding \ntax. Under the UK pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, the employers administer a \ncumulative system, designed to collect the correct amount of tax on employment \n23\nincome as received on a current-year basis. Tax and National Insurance contributions \n(NICs) are deducted regularly from each pay-packet under a system governed by the \n24\nIncome Tax (Employments) Regulations 1993. An employer may be liable to interest \n25\nif he fails to apply PAYE correctly at the right time. Most employees do not fill in a \ntax return. In 1996–97, following the introduction of self-assessment, 9 million tax \n26\nreturns were issued, which cover around 25 per cent of the adult population. As has \nbeen noted in the Introduction, the burdens imposed by the PAYE system and the \n27\nregressive nature of those burdens are under current discussion. The system works \nbest in large firms and with a stable work-force. It is less well geared to casual \n28\nworkers with a number of employers in any one tax year, given its cumulative nature. \nA10 The self-employed, on the other hand, are taxed on the annual profits or gains \naccruing from their trade or profession under a self-assessment system, which requires \nthem to submit an annual tax return. This may be seen as a disadvantage of self-\nemployment by some individual taxpayers. The self-employed taxpayer may use an \naccounting year that does not coincide with the tax year. A current-year basis applies, \nbut payments are made only twice a year (31 January and 31 July, with a balancing \npayment on the following 31 January). Thus the self-employed can have a timing \nadvantage because they make only two payments and because they do not have to \nmake up their accounts for a period that is identical to the tax year.  \nA11 Employees personally have fewer administrative burdens than the self-\nemployed, but, as described above, since employers have heavy compliance burdens, \nthere is no overall saving of compliance costs by virtue of employment. Under PAYE, \nemployers are required to account for benefits in kind as well as salary and wages, and \nthis can add to the complexity and cost of the exercise. Employers argue that a further \n                                                                                                                                            \n23\n Section 203 ICTA 1988. \n24\n SI 1993/744. \n25\n There are only limited rights for the Inland Revenue to proceed directly against an \nemployee and for an employer to recover from an employee when tax has been paid to the \nInland Revenue but not deducted from the salary – see Whitehouse, fn. 42 Chapter 3 above, \nat paras 5.231–5.232. \n26\n L.

Government has announced its intention to extend the principle of \npayment of credits through the pay-packet with an integrated child credit and an \nemployment tax credit for people without children, so this is a burden set to increase \n30\nrather than diminish. The compliance costs of tax collection may be a factor in the \n31\ndecision of some firms to use free-lance workers rather than direct labour. \nOther direct tax differences \nA12 Other differences in the direct tax system as it relates to the employed and self-\nemployed are structurally inevitable. For example, tax reliefs for employee share \nschemes are designed to create an incentive for employees, but also, in effect, turn \nthose employees into entrepreneurs to an extent and will be utilised by entrepreneurs. \nBusiness capital tax reliefs are largely designed for those owning their own business. \nThe reliefs are extended to share-owning employees in some circumstances, though \nnot always to those owning shares in quoted businesses. Discussion of these reliefs \nand incentives is outside the scope of this paper, but they do highlight the blurring at \nthe edges between employees and the self-employed, given the legal vehicles available \nfor setting up in business. The existence of these reliefs may be a factor in deciding in \nwhat form to do business, where the taxpayer has that choice, though for many of the \n‘grey area’ people described above, these considerations will not be an issue since no \nlarge amounts of capital are involved.  \nValue added tax (VAT) \nA13 VAT is charged on taxable supplies of goods and services made in the UK by \n32\na taxable person in the course or furtherance of a business carried on by him. A \nperson carrying on a trade, profession or vocation is included in the definition of \n33\nbusiness (though it also goes wider than this). Thus self-employed persons must \n34\nregister for VAT purposes, subject to certain thresholds. VAT is not payable in \nrespect of the services provided by an employee to his employer. Again, there is a \n35\ncompliance cost issue here and efforts have been made to reduce the burden on \n                                                                                                                                            \n29\n Report of the Select Committee on the Treasury, fn. 28 above. \n30\n Inland Revenue Budget Press Release, Tax and NICs Reform for Working Families, March \n2000, [2000] STI 381; L.

Nevertheless, the compliance burden may provide an incentive to be \nemployed for those who have the choice.  \nA14 The VAT considerations in relation to self-employment as opposed to \nemployment are not straightforward. VAT registration can be an advantage where \nthere are VATable costs on which input tax can be recovered by a registered trader. \nFor the labour-only contractor over the threshold, working from home and with \nrelatively few VATable expenses, however, his output tax payable to Customs is \nlikely to be more significant than any input tax recoverable, and so VAT returns are \nlikely to be merely an administrative burden. If an outside contractor instead of an \nemployee provides services to an exempt business (for example, a bank), any VAT \ncharged by the outside contractor will not be recoverable. Thus VAT considerations \nmay sometimes pull against other tax considerations, by increasing the costs for an \nexempt business in using an outside contractor. In other trades, where the customer is \na private individual who cannot recover VAT paid, classification of service providers \nas self-employed may be preferred, as it will minimise VAT liability. An example of \nthis incentive in operation can be seen in the hairdressing trade. \n36\nA15 The current VAT registration threshold is £52,000 of taxable supplies. This is \n37\nto be increased in line with inflation and is at the highest level in Europe. For many \nof those borderline workers discussed in this paper, therefore, VAT registration will \nnot be an issue even if they are self-employed. Even for those above the threshold, \nthere are provisions that allow small traders to file VAT returns on an annual basis \nrather than the usual quarterly basis and under a cash accounting scheme. The \n38\nthreshold for these two schemes is to be increased substantially to £600,000. The \ngovernment intends to consult on further simplifications, including a flat-rate scheme \navoiding internal VAT accounting and paying VAT as a percentage of turnover, for \nsmall businesses with a turnover of under £100,000. \n39\nNational Insurance \nContributions \nA16 The tax distinctions between the employed and self-employed may be \nrelatively small compared with the differences in National Insurance contributions. \nThe NICs burden on the self-employed is generally lower than that on employees: \n                                                                                                                                            \n36\n Value Added Tax Act 1994 Schedule 1, para. 1 as amended by SI 2000/804. \n37\n Customs and Excise Pre-Budget Report Press Release, 1, 8 November 2000, [2000] STI \n1600. \n38\n Customs and Excise Pre-Budget Report Press Release, fn. 37 above. \n39\n For a detailed discussion of NICs, see Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, Part IX. \nThe information on benefits used here is taken from Child Poverty Action Group, Child \nPoverty Action Group Welfare Benefits Handbook 2000/2001, (2000) London and from C. \nEmmerson and A. Leicester, A Survey of the UK Benefit System, (2000) Briefing Note no. 13, \nInstitute for Fiscal Studies, London, www.ifs.org.uk/taxsystem/benefitsurvey.pdf. \n 135rates are lower and there is no equivalent to the employer’s contribution. The self-\nemployed are not entitled to all benefits, but, even allowing for this, they contribute \nless to the National Insurance Fund than employees. This gap is narrowing, due to \nstructural changes in the way NICs are being collected. At present, however, there are \nsufficient differences for classification as employed or self-employed to remain \nimportant for this purpose. The government estimate is that the cost of reduced \ncontributions for the self-employed not attributable to reduced benefit eligibility was \n40\n£3.3 billion in 1998–99. For 1999–2000 and 2000–01, this figure is estimated to be \n41\n£2.4 billion. \nA17 There are four main classes of NICs, as shown below.  \nNational Insurance contributions \nClass of contribution Payable by: Giving entitlement to: \nClass 1 Employed earners (primary) and All benefits with contribution \ntheir employers (secondary) conditions \n42\nClass 1A Employers of employed earners No benefits \nClass 2  Self-employed earners All benefits with contribution \nconditions except contribution-\nbased jobseeker’s allowance and \nState Earnings-Related Pension \nScheme (SERPS) \nClass 3 Voluntary contributors Widows’ benefits and retirement \npensions \nClass 4  Self-employed earners No benefits \n \n43\nA18 Class 1 contributions are subject to an earnings floor called the lower earnings \nlimit (LEL). Earning the LEL or more is important in order to qualify for certain \nbenefits. Employees only pay NICs if their weekly earnings exceed the primary \nthreshold (PT). Those earning above the PT pay a rate of 10 per cent on earnings \nbetween the PT and the upper earnings limit (UEL). For income above the UEL, no \n                                                                                                                                            \n40\n Tax Ready Reckoner and Tax Reliefs, (1999) HM Treasury, London, Table 7. \n41\n Tax Ready Reckoner and Tax Reliefs, (2000) HM Treasury, London, Table 7. \n42\n Class 1A NICs are payable by employers only, on most, but not all, taxable benefits in \nkind. They are payable at the same rate as that for secondary Class 1 contributions. For the \nsake of simplicity, they will not be discussed further here, although it is interesting to note \nthat attempts to align NICs on benefits in kind with tax treatment of benefits in kind remain \nincomplete – see S. Bradford, ‘Alignment, but not as we know it’, (2000) Tax Adviser, \nDecember, p. 25. \n43\n Text and table in this paragraph taken from IFS Briefing 9, fn. 26 above. \n 136 \nemployee contributions are paid. Employers also pay NICs for each employee who \nearns over the secondary threshold (ST). Above that level, they pay at a rate of 12.2 \nper cent on earnings above the ST. The table below summarises the structure for \n2000–01. The contracted-out rate is that paid where the employee is in a defined \nbenefit pension scheme instead of SERPS. Different rates apply where the employee \nis contracted out into a defined contribution pension scheme. \nClass 1 NICs rates, 2000–01 \nTotal weekly Employee’s NICs Employee’s NICs Employer’s NICs Employer’s NICs \nearnings (£) Standard rate Contracted-out Standard rate Contracted-out \nrate rate \nBelow 67 (LEL) 0 0 0 0 \n67–76 (PT) 0 0 0 0 \n76–84 (ST) 10 8.4 0 0 \n84–535 (UEL) 10 8.4 12.2 9.2 \nAbove UEL 0 0 12.2 9.2 \n \nA19 The 1998 and 1999 Budgets substantially improved and simplified the \nstructure of NICs to remove ‘steps’ that resulted in disincentives to earning. As part of \nthis planned change, from April 2001, the LEL will be raised to £72 a week. The PT \nwill be aligned with the ST and the income tax personal allowance at £87 a week, and \nno tax or NICs will be paid below that level. The UEL will be raised to £575 a week, \nresulting in a substantial rise, well above the rate of inflation, for higher-paid \n44\nemployees. The 12.2 per cent employer’s rate is to be reduced to 11.9 per cent, with \ncontracted-out rates reduced accordingly. \nA20 There have also been major changes for the self-employed, in the direction \n45\nrecommended by the Taylor Report. Class 2 contributions are paid at a flat rate, \nwhich has been reduced from £6.55 to £2 per week for 2000–02. This has removed \nthe entry fee into work, as was done for employees. Self-employed people with \nearnings below the annual small earnings exception – currently £3,825 p.a., to rise to \n£3,955 in April 2001 – can apply to be exempted from paying Class 2 contributions. \nA21 Class 4 contributions are payable by self-employed individuals whose profits \nexceed the lower profits limit (£4,385 p.a. in 2000–01, to rise to £4,535 in line with \nthe income tax personal allowance in April 2001). The NICs rate is 7 per cent for  \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n44\n Announced in the 1999 Budget and confirmed in the 2000 Pre-Budget Report. \n45\n The Taylor Report 1998, fn. 3 Introduction above. \n 13746\nTWO EXAMPLES \nHigher-paid worker \nAn employee with annual earnings of £50,000 in 2000–01 and his employer will pay NICs as follows (assuming he is not \ncontracted out of SERPS): \nPrimary Class 1 contributions on earnings between the PT (£3,952) and the UEL (£27,820) at 10%  £2,386.80 \nSecondary Class 1 contributions above the ST (£4,368) at 12.2%      £5,567.10 \nTotal          £7,953.90 \nA self-employed person with profit of the same level will pay NICs as follows: \nClass 2 contributions £2 × 52           £104.00 \nClass 4 contributions on profits between lower profits limit (£4,385) and upper profits limit (£27,820) at 7% £1,640.45 \nTotal          £1,744.45 \n    \nLower-paid worker \nAn employee with annual earnings of £10,000 in 2000–01 and his employer will pay NICs as follows (assuming he is not \ncontracted out of SERPS): \nPrimary Class 1 contributions on earnings above the PT (£3,952) at 10%       £604.80 \nSecondary Class 1 contributions above the ST (£4,368) at 12.2%         £687.10 \nTotal          £1,291.90 \nA self-employed person with profit of the same level will pay NICs as follows: \nClass 2 contributions £2 × 52           £104.00 \nClass 4 contributions on profits above lower profits limit (£4,385) at 7%       £393.05 \nTotal             £497.05 \n \nprofits above the lower profits limit and below the upper profits limit. This rate rose \nfrom the previous 6 per cent, but is still a lower rate than envisaged by the Taylor \n47\nReport. For 2000–01, the upper profits limit is £27,820 p.a., but this will rise in \nApril 2001 to £29,900. Above the upper profits limit, no further contributions are \npaid. The rise in the upper profits limit is in line with the rise in the UEL for Class 1 \ncontributions. There has been a marked rise in this limit since 1999 – in the \ngovernment’s words, ‘to ensure a fair base’ for contributions. This term is one that is \n                                                                                                                                            \n46\n First example adapted from Tiley and Collison, fn. 7 Chapter 3 above, at p. 1458. \n47\n The Chancellor made a point of this: see Budget Statement, 9 March 1999. \n 138 \nmore clearly associated with a tax than a contributory system. There is, nevertheless, a \nlong way to go before equality of contributions between employed and self-employed \nis achieved, as can be seen from these figures, particularly as there is no UEL for \nemployers. The combined rates for employees and employers remain significantly \nhigher than the rate for the self-employed, and the incentive to be self-employed \nincreases as income/profits rise. \nBenefits \nA22 Non-contributory benefits, funded from general taxation, are available to the \n48\nemployed and the self-employed equally. Some, but not all, of these are means-\ntested. In addition, as seen in the table at paragraph A17 above, Class 2 contributions \nbring with them entitlement to most contributory benefits. This does not include \nentitlement to SERPS, but many employees are contracted out of this scheme in any \n49\nevent. It does include the basic state pension, subject to contribution record. \nContribution-based jobseeker’s allowance is the other main benefit not available to \nthe self-employed. Class 4 contributions do not count towards any benefit entitlement \nbut are nevertheless income of the National Insurance Fund used for the payment of \nbenefits. \nA23 As mentioned, the self-employed are not entitled to contribution-based, non-\nmeans-tested jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). This is the main reason for actors \nwishing to pay Class 1 contributions, as discussed in Chapter 4 above. The same \nconsideration would apply to homeworkers and other lower-paid workers. They may \nbe below the PT for NICs, or only just above it, so that for a small NICs payment they \ncould obtain a benefit that could prove important to them if they were classified as \nemployees and their employers made the correct returns and payments. For some more \nhighly paid self-employed, however, loss of JSA is not a major concern. For them, the \nsaving in contributions far outweighs the potential loss of JSA. In any event, \ncontribution-based JSA is only payable for six months rather than a year, as was the \ncase with unemployment benefit. In 2000–01, an employee with a sufficient \ncontribution record will receive a maximum of £52.20 per week. Self-employed \nearners must rely on the non-contributory means-tested JSA. This can equal or exceed \nthe contribution-based JSA in some circumstances, since it reflects the needs of the \nclaimant’s family. On the other hand, because family income is taken into account, a \nself-employed person with an earning spouse will not normally be eligible for \ncontribution-based JSA, whereas an employee would receive non-means-tested JSA. \n                                                                                                                                            \n48\n Non-contributory benefits include the following (where asterisk denotes means-tested): \nCategory D retirement pension; child benefit; income-based jobseeker’s allowance*; invalid \ncare allowance; disability living allowance; industrial injuries benefit; attendance allowance; \nguardian’s allowance; Social Fund*; cold weather payments*; housing benefit*; council tax \nbenefit*; income support*; family credit*; disability working allowance*. \n49\n Current plans on pension reform also erode the importance of SERPS. \n 139A24 Employees over the LEL and satisfying various conditions about periods of \nemployment will be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) of £60.20 per week in 2000–\n01, for a maximum of 28 weeks. This is paid by the employer, but much of the cost is \nreclaimed from the government. A self-employed person does not receive SSP, but \nreceives incapacity benefit of £50.90 per week for 28 weeks instead if they have \nmade sufficient Class 2 contributions. Incapacity benefit is paid at a higher, taxable \nshort-term rate to employed and self-employed from weeks 29 to 52 and thereafter at a \nlong-term taxable rate. From April 2001, incapacity benefit entitlement will be \npartially means-tested for those with pension income. \nA25 The test for incapacity benefit can be tougher than that for SSP. The test for \nSSP is that the worker is ‘incapable of doing work which [he] could reasonably be \nexpected to do under the terms of [his] contract because [he] has a specific disease or \nbodily or mental disablement’ or treated as being incapable for work. For incapacity \nbenefit, the test is either the ‘own occupation test’, which is similar to the test for SSP, \nor the ‘personal capability assessment’. The latter test applies where the claimant does \nnot have a regular occupation when he falls ill and also for all claimants after 28 \nweeks. It is an objective test that will assess whether the person is capable of \nperforming prescribed activities, without reference to the person’s last job or usual \njob. \nA26 An employed earner is entitled to receive statutory maternity pay (SMP) \nfrom her employer subject to certain service requirements. To qualify, her earnings \nmust be above the LEL. SMP lasts for 18 weeks. For the first six weeks, it is paid at \n90 per cent of the claimant’s average weekly earnings (if higher than £60.20), and for \nthe remaining 12 weeks, it is paid at £60.20 a week. Since August 2000, maternity \nallowance (MA) has been relaxed substantially and is now more freely available to \nthe self-employed than previously. This was announced in the 1999 Budget as a quid \npro quo for increasing the self-employed NICs and should assist groups of workers \nsuch as homeworkers. It is payable to women unable to claim SMP and is non-\ncontributory, but it does require the claimant to have been employed or self-employed \n(not necessarily with the same employer or continuously) for at least 26 weeks in the \nperiod of 66 weeks up to and including the week before the baby is due. The earnings \ncondition requires that average earnings from all employment are at least £30 a week. \nMA is payable for up to 18 weeks. If average weekly earnings are at least equal to the \nLEL, the standard rate of £60.20 will be payable for the full 18 weeks. If average \nweekly earnings are less than the LEL but at least £30 a week, the claimant will \nreceive variable-rate MA (being 90 per cent of the claimant’s average weekly \nearnings) up to a maximum of the standard rate. \nA27 Entitlement to  widow’s payment, widowed mother’s allowance or widow’s \npension is dependent on adequate NICs having been paid, but these may be of Class \n1, 2 or 3. \nCompliance costs and merger \n 140 \nA28 As can be seen from this brief description, the issues surrounding collection of \nNICs and entitlement to benefits are very complex. The contributory principle \nsurvives and requires the collection and maintenance of detailed contribution records. \nAt the same time, the link between contributions (and particularly the level of those \ncontributions) and benefits is becoming less clear and the progressive rates of NICs \nmake them look more akin to taxation. The compliance cost on employers of \ncollecting both the correct amount of NICs and tax, applying similar, but not identical \nsystems, is high, and this has led to calls for a full merger of the tax and NICs systems \nand even for a review of the contributory principle. As discussed above, full \n50\nintegration in the near future seems unlikely, but the pressure is mounting. \n51\nEmployment rights and status \nA29 In the past, status as an employee has been crucial to those seeking access to \n52\nemployment protection. As seen in Chapter 4, recently certain types of employment \nprotection have been extended to a wider range of workers than those who would be \ndefined as employees under the case law discussed in Chapter 3 above. Other \nprotection remains confined to employees. \nA30 In addition to the status requirement, there is often a continuity of employment \nrequirement. This presents claimants with a difficulty in many cases and explains why \nsome casual workers seek to show the existence of an ‘umbrella’ employment \n53\ncontract, as in the Carmichael case. It has been pointed out that there is a degree of \nduplication between the mutuality test for employment, discussed in Chapter 3, and \n54\nthe statutory tests for continuity of employment. In effect, there is a double threshold. \nThe continuity requirement is now easier to satisfy than previously, however, since the \ngovernment was forced by decisions of the European Court of Justice to abolish the \nrequirement for employees to have worked at least 16 hours in a week for the service \n55\nto count towards this continuity requirement. There are also provisions in the \nEmployment Rights Act 1996 permitting the combination of short periods of \nemployment into a month of continuous employment, and certain weeks of absence \n56\ncount for continuity purposes under the statutory provisions. EU pressure has also \nresulted in the reduction in length of the qualifying period of continuous employment \n                                                                                                                                            \n50\n See Introduction above. \n51\n For up-to-date accounts of employment law, drawn upon for this section, see: Selwyn, fn. \n92 Chapter 3 above; B.

This may lead to the need for ‘umbrella’ contracts being \n57\nlessened. \nA31 Employees are entitled not to be dismissed without notice. Failure to provide \ndue notice can lead to a claim for wrongful dismissal. Under the Employment Rights \nAct 1996, employees are entitled to a minimum period of one week’s notice after one \nmonth’s continuous employment and of two weeks’ notice after two years’ continuous \nemployment, increasing by one week each year up to a maximum of 12 weeks after 12 \nyears’ continuous employment. There can be contractual rights over and above this.  \n58\nA32 Employment status is necessary for protection against unfair dismissal. A \ndismissal (whether with or without notice) will be unfair if no fair reason was given, if \nthe disciplinary process leading to dismissal does not conform to standards of fairness \nand natural justice, or if the decision to dismiss is not reasonable in all the \ncircumstances. The Employment Rights Act 1996 sets out in more detail what is \nrequired. It is possible to contract out of unfair dismissal protection in relation to \nfixed-term contracts in some circumstances. \nA33 Only one year of continuous service is needed to benefit from the general \n59\nprotection against unfair dismissal. The right not to be dismissed for an inadmissible \nreason (related to discrimination law) or on the grounds of pregnancy or childbirth \ndoes not depend upon length of service. If the continuous service requirement is not \nsatisfied, the only remedy, if any, may be for wrongful dismissal. \nA34 There are three remedies for unfair dismissal: reinstatement, re-engagement \nand compensation. Compensation consists of a basic award and a compensatory \naward. There may also be an additional award and a special award in limited \ncircumstances. The basic award takes account of a number of factors, including length \n60\nof continuous service. The compensatory award is more discretionary, but is subject \nto a limit, recently raised to £50,000 by the Employment Relations Act 1999.  \nA35 One reason for dismissal that may be fair under the unfair dismissal legislation \nis redundancy. Two years’ continuous employment is still necessary to be able to \n61\nclaim statutory redundancy pay. The payment is calculated according to a formula \nthat includes factors such as the employee’s age and length of service. Where an \nemployer is insolvent, redundancy payments may be claimed from the DTI. As we \nhave seen in Chapter 3, however, there have been attempts to deny this payment to \n                                                                                                                                            \n57\n Collins 2000, fn. 11 Chapter 1 above. \n58\n Section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. \n59\n Section 108 Employment Rights Act 1996 amended by the Unfair Dismissal and Statement \nof Reasons for Dismissal (Variation of Qualifying Period) Order 1999/1436. \n60\n Sections 113–124 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. \n61\n Section 155 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. \n 142 \nowner/directors of insolvent companies on the grounds that they are not employees for \n62\nthis purpose. \n63\nA36 Employment status  is also required for guaranteed pay, statutory sick pay, \n64\nmaternity leave and statutory maternity pay under the Social Security and \nContributions Act 1992. Continuous employment of varying lengths is required to \nbenefit from these rights. \nA37 Extended definitions of employment apply under sex, race and disability \ndiscrimination statutes, as we have seen in Chapter 4 above. Those under contract \npersonally to execute work or labour are included, but this definition does not cover \nall self-employed persons. \nA38 The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 sets out the procedures for enforcing a \nnational minimum wage for all workers as defined in paragraph 4.110 above, as \nextended for homeworkers and agency workers as explained in paragraph 4.116 \nabove. These extended interpretations continue to incorporate the issue of whether \nthere is a contract of employment and, though other workers are also included, there \nremain questions about definitions. Other statutes that refer to workers for at least \nsome purposes include the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Employment Rights \n(Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Part \nTime Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000. The last \nof these could be particularly helpful for some of the non-standard groups of workers \nreferred to throughout this paper, requiring them to be paid and receive benefits no \nless favourable than those paid to full-time workers, though on a pro-rata basis. The \nexpress extension in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 of workers to include \nhomeworkers has not been adopted in these Regulations. \nEuropean Community law \nA39 For the purpose of co-ordination of social security provisions for migrant \nworkers within European Community law, persons are identified as employed or self-\nemployed by reference to the categorisation applied to them by the national social \n65\nsecurity schemes of the Member States concerned. This therefore assumes the \nexistence of these categories in national law. It has been argued that any proposals to \ndepart from this distinction in UK law would make the EC Regulations unworkable, \n                                                                                                                                            \n62\n See paras 3.97–3.101 above. \n63\n Section 28 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (entitlement to pay even where there is \ninsufficient work). \n64\n Sections 71 and 75 of the ERA as amended by the Employment Relations Act 1999 and the \nMaternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999. \n65\n Regulation 1408/71 as amended. \n 143though presumably this could be dealt with by amendment, since each Member State \n66\nhas different provisions set out in the Annex to the Regulations. \nA40 More generally, Article 39 of the EC Treaty refers to freedom of movement for \nworkers and Article 43 (freedom of establishment) refers to self-employed persons. \nThese terms may not be defined by reference to the national laws of the Member \nStates but have a Community meaning, otherwise the purposes of the Treaty could be \n67\nfrustrated by the exclusion of categories of person. Both Articles are based on the \nsame principles, however, so that persons engaged in some sort of genuine economic \nactivity will normally be protected in one way or the other.  \nA41 In  Lawrie-Blum, the Court stated that the ‘essential feature of an employment \nrelationship is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and \nunder the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration’. \n68\nTherefore, in Asscher v Staatssecretaris, it was held that a company director and sole \nshareholder of a company was not an employee for EC law purposes since he was not \n69\nunder the direction of any other person or body that he did not himself control. It is \nfor the national court to decide whether there is such subordination in the light of the \nconsiderations of fact and law in each particular case. To date, there has been no \ninfluence from these EC cases on UK domestic law, but some future influence is \npossible if EC issues begin to arise in domestic courts and become part of the \nconsideration of law and fact that the judges must take into account in deciding \nworker status. \n                                                                                                                                            \n66\n The DSS 1994 report, fn. 80 Chapter 3 above. \n67\n Levin v Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1982] ECR 1035; Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-\nWurttemberg [1986] ECR 2121. \n68\n Case C-107/94 ECJ [1996] STC 1025. \n69\n Though he was taxed as an employee under the national law of the Netherlands. This did \ncomplicate the case: see J. Avery Jones, ‘Further thoughts on non-discrimination in Europe \nfollowing Asscher’, [1997] British Tax Review 75. \n 144\n",

The event provided the ODA with industry feedback on their contract packaging strategy. The process of selecting contractors begins next month.\n\nWelcoming industry guests this morning ODA Director of Infrastructure and Utilities Simon Wright said:\n\n\"The structures, roads and bridges will be integral in fitting the various parts of the Olympic Park jigsaw together. These essential pieces of infrastructure will play a vital role in helping create the best-connected Games ever and providing an open and accessible Park in legacy.\n\n\"Dialogue with the industry is very important as we move to the next stage of the project and this industry day provides a significant opportunity to explain and hear feedback on our approach.\"\n\nFollowing an introduction from Simon Wright, the industry day heard and discussed presentations from key ODA management and procurement staff.\n\nOJEU notices for the first phase of contract packages will be issued in March with a view to appointing by early 2008. Companies will be able to tender for contracts online when the procurement process begins and the contracts go live on the ODA’s eTendering website .\n\nMedia Enquiries\n\nContact the Olympic Delivery Authority Press Office on 020 3 2012 700\n\n\nRelated content\n\tOlympic Park\n\n\nNews\n\tPreferred bidder announced for energy centres10 October 2007\n\n\tNew recycling machine boosts clean-up of Park10 October 2007\n\n\tBroxbourne venue update8 October 2007\n\n\nBlog\n\tLife's never dullPosted by Vivienne Ramsey on 2 October 2007\n\n\tOpen House - behind the scenesPosted by 2012 Editor on 26 September 2007\n\n\tBeing part of something bigPosted by Charlotte, work experience on 3 August 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the top\n\tContact us\n\tWeb accessibility statement\n\tJobs\n\tPrivacy policy\n\tTerms of use\n\tAbout this site\n\tFreedom of information\n\tCopyright\n\nThe official site of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n\n",

The e-Government National Awards 2005 were presented on the evening of 25th January, at a high level dinner at the Savoy Hotel attended by 440 senior council and civil service leaders. \n  The awards are a yardstick for UK excellence in e-Government - and highlights the massive benefits to the UK of services like Directgov, online vehicle licensing, school pupil e-assessment at Key stage 3, and numerous council e-services improving lives in localities across the UK \n  Hampshire County Council was a joint winner in the Efficiency category with its Hantsnet service. The project transformed Hampshire County Council's computer services and network architecture, in support of the County's modernisation programme, and provided an efficient and effective platform for ICT based services which already generates savings of at least £4m annually. \n  Departments have access to a cost effective set of systems for supporting new/more efficient ways of working - helping with the delivery of better and more available services for citizens. With the last of the County's mainframes being switched off in April 2005 Hampshire County Council now has a highly efficient infrastructure to deliver effective high availability services. \n  The thin client technology employed has made supporting and upgrading applications on thousands of desktops in hundreds of locations far less expensive and time-consuming. \n  e-Government is a prime enabler for transformation of the way that central and local Government interact and communicate with UK Citizens and local authorities were 97% e-enabled by the start of the year. \n  Councils, central government departments, non-departmental public bodies and National e-Government Projects are all among the Finalists - showing a great diversity and spread of achievement in e-Government right across the UK. \n  Jim Murphy MP, Parliamentary Secretary at the Cabinet Office said: \n \"e-Government is one of the most important ways the Government can deliver public services reform. We are committed to developing Government IT systems and services that make real and tangible improvements to the lives of British people and businesses. The e-Government National Awards are our way to recognise the best attempts to deliver on this commitment.\" \n  Jim Fitzpatrick MP - Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the \n Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said: \n  \"I'm delighted to see so many councils entering the e-Government National Awards. Local e-government has made enormous progress over the last five years, and this is shown by the number and high quality of the bids. \" \n  Ian Watmore, Head of the Prime Minister's deliver Unit - and formerly Government CIO and head of e-Government at the Cabinet Office, said: \n  \"The Cabinet Office e-Government Unit is proud to support the e-Government National Awards\". \n  \"For many government organisations, technology has fundamentally changed their relationship with citizens and businesses. Beyond putting services online this is the future of technology in Government - using IT to enable a wider transformation of the way Government works. There are many innovative services being provided across the public sector which very often don't get the publicity and reward that they deserve. I hope that these awards can play a part in addressing that.\" \n  \"e-Government is a key tool in service transformation for central departments and local authorities - and will impact on the lives of all UK citizens\", says Christopher Histed, founder of the e-Government National Awards and its organiser PublicTechnology.net, the online news source for the e-Government & public sector IT community. \n  The Government recently published its IT strategy, 'Transformational Government' - which promises a wide-ranging plan to transform and improve UK public services via IT and e-Government. \n  The government IT strategy has three key points: \n  1) Services enabled by IT must be designed around the citizen or business, not the provider, and provided through modern, co-ordinated delivery channels. This will improve the customer experience, achieve better policy outcomes, reduce paperwork burdens and improve efficiency by reducing duplication and routine processing, leveraging delivery capacity and streamlining processes. \n  2) Government must move to a shared services culture - in the front-office, in the back-office, in information and in infrastructure - and release efficiencies by standardisation, simplification and sharing. \n  3) There must be broadening and deepening of government's professionalism in terms of the planning, delivery, management, skills and governance of IT enabled change. This will result in more successful outcomes; fewer costly delivery failures; and increased confidence by citizens and politicians in the delivery of change by the public services. \n  The Prime Minister commissioned the strategy to seize the opportunity provided by technology to transform the business of government. Technology has a major part to play in the solutions to each of three major challenges which globalisation is setting modern governments - economic productivity, social justice and public service reform. Only a strategic view will enable the United Kingdom to use technology decisively and effectively across government to meet its national objectives. \n  In particular, the strategy was directed to provide overall technology leadership in three key areas: \n * The transformation of public services for the benefit of citizens, businesses, taxpayers and front-line staff. \n * The efficiency of the corporate services and infrastructure of government organisations, thus freeing resources for the front-line. \n * The steps necessary to achieve the effective delivery of technology for government. \n  Notes to editors \n  1. The e-Government Unit (eGU) in the Cabinet Office has been tasked by the Prime Minister to 'ensure that IT supports the business transformation of Government itself so that we can provide better, more efficient, public services.' \n  2. The e-Government Unit (eGU) in the Cabinet Office are responsible for; \n a. formulating information technology (IT) strategy and policy \n b. developing common IT components for use across government \n c. promoting best practice across government \n d. delivering citizen-centred online services \n  Cabinet Office Press Office 70 Whitehall LONDON SW1A 2AS \n http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk \n  Client ref 01/06 \n  GNN ref 127902P \n  \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPrivacy policy\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tDisclaimer\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tPrinter-friendly version\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tAccessibilty\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDepartment news\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tNational news\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tRegional news\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tNDS\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHome\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tAbout GNN\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tLibrary\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tContacts\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tHelp\n\n\t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\tSite credits\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSearch \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAdvanced search\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNews and information tailored for you\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUsername:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPassword:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemember me:     \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tForgotten password\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign up\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload everything on this page (ZIP file)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet WinZip\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHAMPSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL A WINNER IN UK E-GOVERNMENT NATIONAL AWARDS\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdownload (34KB)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n",

Last Friday, Kim Howells and I put ourselves in the proverbial hotseat when we held a special “Children and Young People’s Advice Surgery” and invited local schools to send us clients. Three schools took up the invitation and our thanks to teachers at Cefn School in Glyncoch, Hawthorn and Coedylan for encouraging and accompanying our young clients. We were extremely impressed with the interest the young people showed in local and national issues. They wanted to ban hunting, were worried about student loans and wanted the redevelopment of Pontypridd to go ahead with a new swimming pool in the park. All age groups were worried about the rise of mindless vandalism, the amount of litter on our streets, and school buses. Teenagers in particular wanted “somewhere to go.” \n\nAs a result of doing this surgery, Kim and I are keen to put more young people’s surgeries into our regular advice surgery calendar. On the back of the good ideas expressed by the young people of Pontypridd, I wanted to let you know that the Assembly is currently asking for people’s opinions on what kind of services should be provided for young people generally – from youth services to careers advice to smart cards. A group of experts from outside the Assembly have written a report called “Extending Entitlement” and we are particularly keen to have young people’s views on it. I know that some school councils have already discussed it and if you have an interest in improving services for young people, get in touch with my office and we will make sure that you have a copy of the report. Comments have to be in by the end of March, so there is plenty of time.\n\nHappy birthday Pontypridd and District Housing Association (PDHA) - 21 years old this week. It’s not just a housing association providing houses for rent, but also helps older people who want to live at home with free confidential advice. It won a special award, Participation 2000, this year for working with homeless young people who helped build their own homes. Small, but beautiful! Congratulations to the staff and the management committee – particularly, the founder members.

The £1.7 million EPSRC SCRATCH project (Supply Chain Research Applied to Clean Hydrogen) will develop the potential applications further.\n\nProfessor Macaskie spent time working in industry as a result of Royal Society/EPSRC Industry Fellow. She says, “The industry fellowship has been very beneficial in setting up enduring links and in seeing how the other sector operates.”\n\t\n\tMore Information\n\t\nSchool of Biosciences at University of Birmingham\n\n\tSCRATCH project - EPSRC grant details\n\tIndustry Fellowships scheme\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLast modified 23 April 2007\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\n\t\t \n\t\tPrinter Friendly\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t \tHelp\n\t\t\t| Events | Feedback\n\t\t\t| Disclaimer | Logos\n\t\t\t| Accessibility\n\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

Gemara \n\nBL Add. MS 25717, ff. 72v-73\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCopyright © The British Library Board  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the Talmud?\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Talmud contains the Mishnah (oral law) and the Gemara ('Completion', written in Aramaic). The Mishnah was the first great creation of the rabbis, who were not clergy but came from all walks of life. It is a large collection of sayings, arguments and counter-arguments that touch on virtually all areas of life. \n\n\t\t\t\tOver the three centuries following the compilation of the Mishnah, the rabbis added enormously to it with the Gemara: what they called a 'sea' of learning, using stories about both biblical personalities and their own lives, sober legal arguments and fanciful imaginings of the world of old and the world to come. They wrote it all down in multiple volumes that go under the name Talmud, 'Teaching'. \n\n\t\t\t\tWhy is this a 'Babylonian'  Talmud?\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Talmud developed in two major centres of Jewish scholarship: Babylonia and Palestine. The Jerusalem or Palestinian Talmud was completed c.350, and the Babylonian Talmud (the more complete and authoritative) was written down c.500, but was further edited for another two centuries. The Talmud served as the basis for all codes of rabbinic law. \n\nFrom the Palestinian tradition of Jewish worship came the Ashkenazi rite used in Western and Eastern Europe and Russia. From the Babylonian tradition came the Sephardi rite followed in Spain, Portugal, North Africa, and the Middle East. Both rites, as well as some others, are still practised in Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide.\n \nIn genealogical discussions, people often use the term Ashkenazi and Sephardic to describe Jews who come from the respective regions. \n\nWhat is  the  significance of the Talmud?\n\nGetting to grips with a Talmudic text can be demanding. While it is possible to read a page of the Bible in a matter of minutes, depending on the difficulty, a page of Talmud may take an hour or considerably more to go through with understanding. Traditionally it is studied with a partner or 'friend' in order to recreate the internal arguments and make sure that the subject in question, whether marriage, business ethics, capital punishment, property law or dietary regulations, has been examined from every conceivable angle. This kind of study leads to sharpness of mind, but also creates an intense community of shared ideas and visions. \n\nAlong with its companion literature, the Midrash (multiple collections of interpretations of the Bible, much like the interpretations and sermons on their own Scriptures by Christians and Muslims), the Talmud ensured that male Jews, who engaged in this study their whole lives, and their womenfolk, who were taught the stories (but not the legal material) in more popular form, were armoured against an often unfriendly outside world by their own internal world of values.\n\nWhy is this manuscript so rare?\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the Talmud was the target of relentless condemnation, vilification and censorship by the Christian Church. Vicious hostility to its allegedly offensive and blasphemous contents led to frequent public burnings, the first in Paris in 1242. \n\nAs a result, very few complete manuscripts of the Talmud have survived, and the remaining fragmentary ones are also rather scarce. \n\nWhat do these pages show?\n\nThis manuscript (in square Ashkenazi hand) is an exceptionally rare specimen, which, fortunately, has not been censored or mutilated. \n\nIt shows the end of tractate Arakhin ('Valuations'), which deals with issues relating to the upkeep of the sanctuary, and the start of tractate Keritot ('Excisions'), which discusses sins that incur divine punishment. \n\n\n\n\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSearch the Online Gallery\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tExplore treasures of the world's great faiths\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tTurning the Pages\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tMore sacred texts\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tInteractive Map\n\n\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Disclaimer | Privacy | Copyright © The British Library Board\n\n\tCopyright © The British Library Board\n\n\n\n\n",

The conference brought together some 150 delegates from across Europe, the US and Asia, including publishers as well as funding bodies and research institutions. \n\n  A major theme of the conference appears to have been a concern, expressed by Sir John O’Reilly, the former Chief Executive of the EPSRC in the UK, that peer review systems tend to be conservative in assessing the quality of innovative research proposals; and there was much discussion about how to ensure that pioneering research is not jeopardised by such conservatism. There was also some interesting discussion about the need to adopt innovative approaches in the peer review process itself, including video-enhanced discussions and online discussions; but also about the need to minimise the burdens that the peer review system places on reviewers.\n\n   \n\n  The conclusion seems to have been that there is a need for “a strategic evaluation at a more conceptual level, not of a specific mechanism, but of the underlying principles and ideas………..Continuously monitoring the peer review system on which the quality of science so heavily depends will contribute to its improvement.” Who will take on the job of providing such an evaluation, and such a monitoring role, is an interesting question.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | peer review | publishing \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Research Data and Laboratory Notebooks\n\n    Posted by Michael Jubb, 04 May 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThere’s an interesting and rather strong editorial in Nature this week which complements the consultation draft we issued a few weeks ago of principles relating to the stewardship of research data.\n\nIt urges that research institutions and funders should show leadership by promoting the use of electronic laboratory notebooks, and provide the infrastructure support earmarked for the development and upkeep of notebook systems. The rationale is twofold: first to protect against error and fraud; and second, to allow the sharing and archiving of data, with each notebook allocated a unique identifier.\n\nAs Nature puts it, by providing support for such systems, concerns about the loss of data can be assuaged, and the rigour and transparency of publicly-funded research will be improved. It will be interesting to see how the funding agencies react to this proposal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | data | funding \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      E-research skills for librarians\n\n    Posted by Stephane Goldstein, 03 May 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tHere's a bit of news that nicely complements the recent publication of the RIN-CURL report on researchers' use of library services.  Under the auspices of the CURL / SCONUL taskforce on e-research, there will be a workshop on 14-15 June, in Edinburgh (hosted by the National e-Science Centre) on 'Support for e-research - Filling the library skills gap'.  This promises to be an interesting opportunity for university librarians or information professionals to hear, from expert practitioners, about developments in e-research and the developing infrastructure of support.\n\nThe event will explore current developments and their impact upon library support and services. How will services be re- engineered to interface seamlessly with researchers' changing work processes? Who are librarians' partners in developing support structures for e-Research? How can libraries assist with support for the use of distributed networks and the management of data generated by this research? Very timely issues indeed for a rapidly-changing environment.\n\nPlaces at the workshop are limited, so it's advisable to book as soon as possible.\n\nAnd if you haven't yet seen the RIN-CURL report referred to at the beginning - which has a thing or two to say about e-research - please don't hesitate to do so now!  It's already been downloaded over 2500 times, so it's obviously a good read...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | e-research | library | training \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Email Britain\n\n    Posted by Jackie Van Bueren, 03 May 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe British Library is asking people to send in an email during the month of May.

It's over. It's gone. Finito. \n\nThere'll be no tears, however, because it turns out few people were interested in using our plugoo chat widget. \n\nIt sat in the right-hand sidebar of this blog, and gave you the chance to have a quick and easy chat with me if I was at my desk. \n\nI'm going to maintain that it was a useful experiment, and it certainly displayed our commitment to communication. It was sincere - I was eagerly awaiting the chance to talk to any visitors, help with any problems they had, discuss something we'd written or done.\n\nDespite the significant number of readers this blog is delighted to have, few of you decided to use the plugin. So here's some ideas I have about why. \n\n\tYou didn't see it\n\tYou didn't know what it was\n\tYou weren't interested in using it\n\tYou didn't feel you had anything to say\n\tYou read the blog via our rss feed so never came across it\n\tYou didn't want to have your conversation in view of everyone else (it's actually a private 1-1, but this wasn't obvious)\n\tYou couldn't use it because your network/firewall wouldn't allow it\n\tYou had something to say, but there were more apprioate methods of saying it. \n\n\nOr was it something else? Let me know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | internet \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Putting the listserv out of its misery\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 26 Apr 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t2 comments\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tAt my university, anybody could set up an email listserv in about 45 seconds. And there were thousands of them. I spent a brief time as a list administrator for the college football team - it was meant to be used to organise fixture times and squad details, but banter and jokes dominated the content after only a couple of weeks.\n\n The relevant and the not-so-relevant were both useful features (think team-spirit etc), but a significant minority were frustrated with all the \"noise,\" and wanted out. It was a hassle taking off people individually (who would get quickly irate if you didn't), and then contacting them individually. It was impossible to remember everybody's individual preferences. In short, the system didn't work. \n\nBy using a blog search engine that Phil Bradley mentioned on his blog, I came across a \"libraries community\" in the blog-land that is livejournal. It has over 1,700 members. One thread that caught my attention was called \"Putting the liserv out of its misery.\" Here are some choice quotes:\n\nI am not implying that a subject discussion forum itself is a bad idea, or that the discussions aren't valuable.. but the listserv seems to be a community-facilitating technology that is well, just so last century.\n\n\n\nWouldn't it be easier to set up a space where subscribers could actually follow full threads and not be inundated by avalanches of emails?.\n\n\n\nIt seems like you should subscribe to the digest versions of these lists.\n\n\n\nHarnessing RSS feeds will be the swaying point, if anything, becuase now you can have the communication come to you.\n\n\n\nI use rules, filters, and search to sort out my email overload and go through the interesting ones when I have time. What's the problem?\n\n\n\nSeeing as email is still one of the preferred methods of receiving information - and that people have developed ways of coping with the deluge - I've added a new form in the left-hand column of this blog. If you so desire, you can subscribe to the RIN Team Blog by email update.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | rss \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Taxonomy, Folksonomy, Teamsonomy, Institutionomy!\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 23 Apr 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t2 comments\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tTwo things happening a week today: 1) plenty of time to register for our big event, and 2) the trial period for our plugoo chat plugin (in the right-hand sidebar) is ending, so do take the opportunity now to say hello! \n\nRight. I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that we all know what I mean by the word taxonomy. It's the practice or technique of classification. Right? So you could, for example, apply a classification to the pages on this website. This page has been classified with the tags \"data\" and \"internet.\"\n\n As I've mentioned previously, taxonomies online can be radically different to traditional cataloguing. The difference is in the vocabulary - catalogues use a controlled vocabulary like the Dewey Decimal System or the Library of Congress Subject Headings; whereas websites let the amateur choose the keywords. \n\nI'm sure you've also heard the term folksonomy, which is simply the process of letting the multitude choose the tags. For example, what if I gave you the chance to classify this very blog post. You'd probably choose some different tags to me. If hundreds of people added their own choice of tags to every page, we'd end up with a pretty unique cataloguing system for this website. You'd likely stumble across some pages you weren't bargaining for. \n\nFor the RIN website here, we use what I'd like to call a teamsonomy. I sat down and drew together 30 or so keywords, then my colleagues looked through it and made some suggestions. Then it was settled. A combination of the tax- and the folk-, I suppose. Each time you make a new page/blog post, you choose which tag to apply. But then when a new colleague joined: \"you don't have a \"research\" tag! - she pointed out.  \n\nSuddenly it dawned on me - we had nothing more than a controlled vocabulary. So I'm now working on a way to let my colleagues (every now and then) add new tags to our list on the fly. I think teamsonomy is a fair enough description.\n\nWhat would happen, however, if we had a much larger team? What if it was an entire institution? Who has control of the list, and who should...or shouldn't?!\n\n\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who's been thinking about it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | data | internet \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      OECD Recommendation on Access to Research Data Arising from Public Funding\n\n    Posted by Michael Jubb, 19 Apr 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWe have just learned that the OECD Council agreed in December last a recommendation to Member Countries on access to research data arising from public funding (which is taken to mean data obtained through research conducted by government agencies or departments, or conducted using public funds provided by any level of government).\n\n The Council’s decision essentially gives the status of a formal recommendation to the guidelines produced by a working group that was established following an earlier Ministerial Declaration on access to research data in 2004. The guidelines are based around the principles set out in that declaration: openness, transparency, legal conformity, protection of intellectual property, formal responsibility, professionalism, interoperability, quality and security, efficiency, and accountability. \n\nWe have taken these guidelines into account in the consultation draft statement of principles and guidelines on the stewardship of research data that we issued earlier this month. It seems a little odd that the OECD has not given any publicity to the Council recommendation: we could not find any reference to it on the webpages of the Science and Technology Directorate. But the formal terms of the recommendation are that member countries should\n\ntake into consideration the Principles and Guidelines on Access to Research Data from Public Funding ………… as appropriate for each Member country, [and] develop policies and good practices related to the accessibility, use and management of research data\n\n\n\nThis adds force to the need to address the kinds of issues that we set out in our recent paper, and we shall be interested to see reactions and responses to it in this light.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | access | data | digital | government \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      BBC Archives Online?\n\n    Posted by Michael Jubb, 17 Apr 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t0 comment\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tI see that according to today’s Daily Telegraph, the BBC will announce later this week a trial of a scheme to make significant portions of its archive material available over the web. The service will start on a small scale, but according to the Telegraph, it is planned to launch a national service in a year’s time. The service will be free of charge to licence payers in the UK, but there will be charges for overseas users.\n\n   \n\n  The BBC is a member of the Strategic E-Content Alliance, whose aim is to “build a common information environment where users of publicly funded e-content can gain best value from the investment that has been made by reducing the barriers that currently inhibit access, use and re-use of e-content”. A service of this kind fits well with those aims, and could bring real benefits to researchers in many areas of the arts, humanities and social sciences. There will, no doubt, be many kinds of intellectual property issues to sort out, but we look forward to learning more about this initiative.\n\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | digital | intellectual property | online \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      Why you shouldn't dismiss \"3.0\" just yet\n\n    Posted by James Brown, 12 Apr 2007\n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\t2 comments\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAdd your views\n\t\t\n\t\t  \t\t\n \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tThe Read/Write Web blog recently ran a competition for tickets to a big web conference. The challenge: define \"web 3.0.\" \n\nAs you read this you might be rolling your eyes either in despair, confusion or exhaustion. But bear with me, because it's worth glimpsing the not-too-distant future. And as I'll explain, the tools that might use this technology are even nearer . So -  the winners were as follows:\n\n\tThe Humorous definition winner: \"Web 3.0 will complete my sentences.\"\n\tThe Serious definition winner: \"Web 3.0 – a decentralized asynchronous me.\"\n\tThe Editor's Choice winner: \"Warning: This comment is BETA.\"\n\n\n\n\n Laura Cohen, at her blog Library 2.0: An Academic's Perspective gives a run down of what might happen to libraries and academics if each of them came true. For example, being able to complete my sentences would make writing academic papers (and blog entries!) an awful lot easier.\n\nWhat Laura really got me thinking about, though, was the serious definition. How far away is it? One tool that she suggests could harness the concept would be a sophisticated RSS reader:\n\nWith good metadata on the source end, and sophisticated customization and learning on the agent end, I might ultimately get the filtered RSS content that I want.\n\n\n\nWell perhaps this is actually much nearer than we realise. My desktop reader lets me create smart feeds by pre-searching for specific words, phrases, tags and authors; flagging up relevant content for me. I haven't tried to use it to exclude content, but it would be a relatively easy tweak to use it as a filter rather than as a highlighter.\n\nI realise the software isn't making any attempt to understand the content, so it's rather crude and not very 3.0! But perhaps the next step is for it to analyse attention data, like which articles I delete and which I click through; then apply some clever filters appropriately. It looks like Google is on the way to doing this.\n\n And then there's tools like Particls. Formerly called Touchstone, this is a \"personalised news and alert service\" which monitors the internet, your feeds and other information like your calendar and emails, learns which are important to you, and alerts you in different ways according to their importance. And I can't go 5 minutes without mentioning Yahoo Pipes these days. \n\nMaybe we're closer than we realise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: RIN Team Blog | internet | semantic web \n \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n« first‹ previous123456next ›last »\n \n     \n\t\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  Tag Cloud\n\n\n  publishing \nlibrary \nEvent \ndata \nscholarly communications \ndigital \ngovernment \ninternet \nsearch & discovery \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \tWhat do these Tags do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n  \n\n    \n     \n\n  Bookmark this page\n\n\n  \t\n\n- With Del.icio.us\n\t\n\n- With Connotea\n\n\n\t\n\nHow & why to use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Who's online\n\n\n  There are currently 0 users and 20 guests online.\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n  RIN.ac.uk | 2007     sitemap.     contact.     accessibility notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\tclose   [x]\n\t\n\t\tUsername\n\n\t\tPassword\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nyour browser is not enabled to support javascript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",
