They are based in Washington DC partner the Tax Justice Network on out ‘Mapping the Faultlines’ project funded by the Ford Foundation which looks at secrecy jurisdictions the world over.\n\nThey also partner us in the Task Force for Financial Integrity and Economic Development. This is backed by the governments of Norway, Germany, France and other states.\n\nWe have a new publication out there, summarising our objectives. It has the same title as this blog and is available here. \n\nThe summary says:\n\nWe may be at a rare moment when the interests of rich and poor countries are synonymous.\n\nAt the heart of the current worldwide economic crisis is a lack of transparency in the global financial system. This is the end product of a half century of creating and expanding a shadow financial structure comprising tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions, disguised corporations, anonymous trust accounts, and fake foundations. Also included in this system are trade mispricing mechanisms, money laundering techniques, and gaps left in western laws that facilitate the movement of corrupt, criminal, and commercially tax evading money across borders. Some estimates suggest that as much as half of global trade and capital     \nmovements pass through this shadow financial system.\n\nThe consequences of this murky structure and the money it moves are now clear:\n\n• In developed countries, credit has dried up in large part due to the difficulty of appraising the quality of assets held by financial institutions that operate partially or wholly within this opaque system. This includes almost all major U.S. and European banks.\n\n• In developing countries, an estimated $1 trillion a year of illicitly generated money is shifted abroad through this system, constituting the most damaging economic condition hurting the poor, undermining poverty alleviation and delaying sustainable growth.\n\nThe Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic Development urges the G-20 to focus on substantially improving transparency in the global financial system. Thus far in discussions and commentaries, greater emphasis has been given to strengthening regulation within the existing structure. While some regulatory     \nimprovements are certainly needed, we believe this emphasis is misguided. Far greater benefit can arise by significantly curtailing the shadow financial system that is clearly at the root of the economic crisis all nations are facing.\n\n\n\nOur recommendations focus on five issues:\n\nPriority 1: Curtailing Trade Mispricing      \nPriority 2: Country-by-Country Reporting       \nPriority 3: Confirmation of Beneficial Ownership       \nPriority 4: Automatic Exchange of Tax Information       \nPriority 5: Harmonization of Predicate Offenses\n\n\n\nI’ll feature each of them over the next few days. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRichard Murphy\t\t\t\tAccounting,  Secrecy jurisidictions,  Tax Havens,  Tax Justice Network,  Transfer Pricing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tComments (0)\n\t\tTrackbacks (0)\n\t\t\t\tLeave a comment\n\t\t\t\tTrackback\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNo comments yet.\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo trackbacks yet.\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tName (required)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tE-Mail (will not be published) (required)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWebsite\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSubscribe to comments feed\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tNotify me of followup comments via e-mail\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\tThe UK tax amnesty 2007\n\tG20 Tax haven sanctions\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRSS feed\n\t\t\t\t\tGoogle\n\tYoudao\n\tXian Guo\n\tZhua Xia\n\tMy Yahoo!\n\tnewsgator\n\tBloglines\n\tiNezha\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Murphy\n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecent Posts\n\t\t\t\tWhat tax havens do - 1 - They handle stolen property \n\tWhat tax havens do \n\tToxic assets are hidden assets \n\tPirates of the Caribbean \n\tI am to be reported for professional misconduct \n\tOf course banks use tax havens for innocent purposes \n\tSwiss secrecy laws had nothing to do with the Nazis \n\tPrint it \n\tFiscal stimulus: Does Government debt really rule it out?

It is important it is kept on farm and not sent back to the Rural Payments Agency. Inspectors visiting farmers to undertake cross compliance checks may ask to see the review document.\n\n“Anyone who fails to complete their review risks potentially severe penalties – perhaps as much as 15 per cent of their single payment scheme claim - as it could be considered an intentional breach of cross compliance.”\n\n\n\nTo help them meet the deadline, West Midlands farmers are being invited to attend a series of workshops aimed at helping them complete the review and deal with issues thrown up by new waste management regulations.\n\nThe workshops are being organised by the West Midlands Rural Hub network under the Green Futures banner with the support of the NFU, CLA, the Environment Agency, the Rural Development Service and Momenta.\n\nEach workshop has an afternoon session at 2pm and an evening session at 7pm.\n\n\n\nThere will also be an NVZ drop in session before each presentation, starting at 1pm and 6pm respectively. These will give farmers the opportunity to discuss individual NVZ issues and gain a clearer understanding of their NVZ records.\n\nThere will also be an opportunity for farmers to get their slurry tested so they can assess the available nitrogen it contains.\n\n\n\nThis information will help farmers with their nutrient management planning, NVZ records, costs and help them to understand the financial value of their muck.\n\n\n\nDates and venues are as follows:\n\nJuly 11: Ewyas Harold Memorial Hall, Herefordshire; \nJuly 12: Rudyard Hotel, near Leek; \nJuly 13: Ludlow Football Club; \nJuly 20: Stratford Cattle Market; \nJuly 25: Hadnall Village Hall, near Shrewsbury.\n\nFarmers can book their place on the workshops by calling the CLA Training Co-ordinator on 01785 284722.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \nMore of the latest Pig Industry News\n\t  Farming Groups Welcome Clean Energy Bill\n\t  First Phase of Green Pig Project Completed\n\t  Aristocrat Speaks out on Intensive Farming on TV\n\t  OIE/FAO FMD Conference Seeks Global Control\n\t  Super-Heated Steam Improves Drying of DDGS\n\t  Report Published on Meat, Fish Retailing in Australia\n\t  Fighting for British Pork Label\n\t  Finance Dept Considers Duty on Feed Wheat\n\t  H1N1 Has Hit Pig Farmers Hard\n\t  Some Spot Buyers Went into Reverse\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\nLogin/Free Registration\n\n» Login \n» Register\n\n\n\nOnline Shop\n \n» Pharmacy (coming soon) \n» Book Shop\n» Equipment\n» Animal Prints\n\n\n\nFree Weekly Newsletter\n » Subscribe » View Past Issues\n\n\n\nNews & Articles by Topic\n » H1N1 Flu  » Company/Products  » Markets and Economics  » WholeHog: Market Trends  » Government & Regulatory  » Pig Health  » Pig Welfare  » Biosecurity & Hygiene  » Artificial Insemination  » Breeding & Reproduction  » Genetics  » Feed & Nutrition  » Drinkers & Water  » Housing Systems  » Heating & Ventilation  » Production Management  » Environmental Management  » Biodigestion & Biofuels  » Waste Management  » Odour Control  » Transportation  » Pig Meat Quality  » Food Safety  » Processing  » Labelling & Traceability  » Marketing Pork  » Training & Development  » Conferences & Events  \n\n\n\nKnowledge Centre\n \n» Pig Industry Videos\n» Pig Industry Downloads\n» Artificial-Insemination\n» Managing Pig Health \n» Pig Diseases\n» Treatment Options \n» Stockmanship Standards \n» Disease Problem Solver \n» Reproduction Problem Solver \n» Swine Bibliography \n» A Focus on Ileitis \n» PCVAD and PMWS \n» Breeds of Swine \n» Links to Pig Organisations\n\n\n  \t  \nProducts & Services\n » Product Showcase Listings   » AI, Reproduction Equipment  » Animal Health Products  » Biosecurity and Hygiene  » Breeding and Genetics  » Feed and Ingredients  » Housing and Equipment  » IT, Software, Internet  \n\n\nDiscussion Forums\n  » Vets and Producers  » General Pig Health  » PMWS and PDNS  » Pig Tales and Stories  » Market Place  » Employment  » \"Off Your Chest\"  \n\n \nBusiness Directory\n  » North America  » UK / Ireland  » Scandinavia  » Mainland Europe  » Latin America  » Asia Pacific  » Rest of the World  » Australia / N.Z.  \n\n    \n\n\t    \n      Our Main Sponsors\n\n      \n        \n\t\t    \t\n\t\t\n\n         \n\n      \n\n      Supporting Partners\n\n      \n\t\t\n      \n\n    \n\n\t    \n\t\t\n\tOur Web Sites\n\t\tThePigSite\n\t\tThePoultrySite\n\t\tTheFishSite\n\t\tTheCattleSite\n\t\tTheBeefSite\n\t\tTheDairySite\n\t\tTheMeatSite\n\t\tTheBioenergySite\n\t\n\t\tThePigSite.cn\n\t\tThePoultrySite.cn\n\t\tTheFishSite.cn\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  © 5M Enterprises Ltd.\n\n    2000 - 2009\n\n    No part of this site may be\n\n    reproduced without permission\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n\n\t\t\n    Learn how to\n\n      market your\n\n      products here\n\n  \n\n  5M Enterprises Ltd., 4 Haywood House, Hydra Business Park, Nether Lane, Sheffield, S35 9ZX, England.\n    Contact ThePigSite | Terms and Conditions | Privacy Policy | Disclaimer\nTelephone: +44 (0) 1234 81 81 80\n\n  \n\n  Co.

We also take matters further by explaining what to do if your complaint is not settled to your satisfaction.\n\n\t\tHave a look at the following topics which summarise as simply as possible how the complaints procedure works:\n\t\t\t\n\t\tHow to complain  \n\n\t\tMaking amends \n\n\t\tPaying tax whilst you complaint is being looked at \n\n\t\tProfessional tax advisers \n\n\t\tContacting the Adjudicator or the Ombudsman\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tHow to complain\n\n\t\t\nHMRC do produce a factsheet - Complaints and putting things right. It is not at all comprehensive but you can download it by using the link and you can also see the LITRG article commenting on the omissions in the factsheet here.\n\t\t\t\n\tIt is relatively simple to complain and you can do it by letter, by telephone or fax. Unfortunately HMRC (unlike some other government departments) cannot currently accept complaints by e mail. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTo get help quickly your tax office will need to know your full name, your national insurance number, your address and the last reference number that they used when contacting you. A telephone number where and when they might contact you would also be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWe know that a lot of people find it hard to complain so there is a basic procedure for you to follow.\n\n\n\t\tThe initial complaint\n\n\t\t\tWrite or telephone or fax the HMRC office that is involved with the problem. Tell them that you are unhappy and wish to complain (if writing, put complaint at the top of the letter). Most problems can be dealt with in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThey should respond very quickly but sometimes their service is not what it should be. If you do not hear from HMRC within two weeks,then chase them. Delays on their part may give you a claim for compensation later. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIf it is not possible to give a full reply within a reasonable time HMRC should provide an interim response with information on the action being taken and when a full response may be expected.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTheir full reply should include details of who may be contacted if it is felt a complaint is not dealt with in a proper manner. \n\n\n\nIf you prefer not to deal with the same people in the office you have been dealing with before, or have tried that and you are still unhappy, then contact, in writing or by telephone, the Customer Service Manager in the office concerned and tell them of your problem.\nTaking it further\n\n\t\t\t If you are unhappy with the response to your initial complaint, you can escalate your problem by once again addressing your letter as a complaint, but asking for the letter to be passed to a senior officer and for them to review the complaint again.\n\n\n\t You should expect a very prompt response at this point. However do not try and bypass the initial complaint step above as a more senior person is unlikely to get involved until you have exhausted the first stages as set out in the initial complaint. \n\n\n\tThe Adjudicator & the Ombudsman\n\n\t\t\tIf you are still unhappy after receiving a response from a senior HMRC officer then you can ask the Adjudicator to look into your complaint. The Adjudicator is independent of HMRC and tries to find solutions by mediation or by making formal recommendations. However bear in mind that they are not entirely unbiaised in their decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe Adjudicator publishes a leaflet that we suggest you read called: AO1 The Adjudicator's Office for complaints about\nHM Revenue & Customs and the Valuation Office Agency\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAlternatively you may contact the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Ombudsman investigates cases where bad administration by any Government department has led to an injustice that has not been remedied. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIf it serves your case better you can contact the Parliamentary Ombudsman at any stage in the procedure for a review of your complaint. You can go straight to the Ombudsman or alternatively you can go to the Adjudicator first and then the Ombudsman.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou cannot contact the Ombudsman directly in the first instance but your MP will do this for you. The Ombudsman is entirely independent and can also consider complaints about the Adjudicators Office.You can find the address of your MP using this link. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDetails on how to contact either the Adjudicator or the Ombudsman are to be found click here \n\n\n\t\t\nBack to the top\n\n\n\t\tMaking amends\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhen things go wrong HMRC say they will:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSay sorry and put things right\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExplain what went wrong\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsider refunding your reasonable costs directly caused by their mistakes or unreasonable delays.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\tDo not be shy in\n        asking for reimbursement of your expenses (e.g. postage & phone calls or professional fees) and for compensation if it is\n        not offered to you. It is very distressing when HMRC make a\n        mistake, especially when it is compounded by delay in responding to\n        you. For example, if you are a tax credits claimant and the payment was\n        delayed or too low and through this you picked up bank charges then ask\n        for these to be reimbursed.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\tIf HMRC have been at fault in not using information they had in their possession and are therefore late in asking you for money that is owed, they will not always seek the full amount that is due. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFor example, if you told them that you were now receiving a State pension but they did not take any action to collect the tax due for two years. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThis will only apply if you could reasonably have believed that you did not owe HMRC any more money. If you think this might apply to you then contact your tax office. If you have any doubts, ask them for a copy of Extra Statutory Concession A19 which covers the position in more detail or you can find this in Extra Statutory Concessions\n\n\n\t\tPaying tax whilst your complaint is being looked at\n\n\t\t\tWhilst HMRC are looking into your complaint we would suggest you pay the correct amount of tax you consider is due. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIf this then proves to be less than the amount you will actually need to pay, you may be charged interest on the excess and similarly if they find that you are due a repayment they will pay you interest on the overpaid tax.\n\n\n\t\tProfessional tax advisers\n\n\t\t\tIf you employ a tax adviser you should take advice on your courses of action. The costs of a tax adviser may be reimbursed in appropriate circumstances. You might also be able to get some help from your local Citizens Advice Bureau .\n\n\n\t\tContacting the Adjudicator or the Ombudsman\n\n\n\t\tBy Letter\n\n\t\tThe Adjudicator's Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t8th Floor\n\n\t\tEuston Tower\n286 Euston Road\n\n\t\tLondon NW1 3US \t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration\n\n\t\tMillbank Tower\n\t\n\t\tMillbank\n\t\n\t\tLondon  SW1P 4QP\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tBy Phone\n \n\t\t\tAdjudicator\t\t0300 057 1111 or 020 7667 1832\n\t(typetalk facilities are available)\n\n\n\t\tBy Fax\n\n\t\t\tAdjudicator\t\t0300 057 1212 or 020 7667 1830\n\t\n\tOmbudsman\t\t020 7217 4160\t\n\n\n\t\tBy e-mail\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\tOmbudsman: opca-enqu@ombudsman.org.uk\n  \n\t\t(Website http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/)\n \n\t\t\n\nBack to the top\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tSearch the site | Sitemap | Print Page\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tCopyright © 2003 - 2009 LITRG | Legal | Design and technology by Reading Room\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n",

This amounts to £295m based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2006. At the date of the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t8 Earnings per share\n\n\tBasic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Group's employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on conversion into ordinary shares of rights held under the employee share  schemes.\n\n\n\t(In £'s million) \t2006\t2005\n\tEarnings: basic and diluted \t851 \t784 \n\t \n\t(Numbers in millions) \t \t \n\tWeighted average number of shares: \t \t \n\tShares for basic earnings per share \t696.3 \t721.6 \n\tPotentially dilutive share options \t3.3 \t3.4 \n\tShares for diluted earnings per share\t699.6\t725.0\n\t \n\t(In pence)\t \t \n\tBasic earnings per share \t122.2 \t108.6 \n\tDiluted earnings per share \t121.6 \t108.1 \n\n\n\n\n\tAs described in note 1 above, management believes that reporting adjusted measures, including adjusted earnings per share, provides a better comparison of business performance for the year and reflects the way in which the business is controlled.

A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, presented at CGU level is shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(In £'s million) \t2006\t2005\n\tGoodwill\tIntangible assets with indefinite lives \tGoodwill\tIntangible assets with indefinite lives \n\tUK \t42\t– \t40 \t– \n\tGermany \t1,164 \t28 \t1,093 \t– \n\tRest of Western Europe \t345 \t47 \t377 \t– \n\tRest of the World \t1,549 \t293 \t1,592 \t– \n\tManufacturing \t346 \t– \t347 \t– \n\t \t3,446 \t368 \t3,449 \t– \n\n\n\n\n\tThe goodwill in Germany and the Rest of the World arose principally on the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.\n\n\tThe Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates and the long term growth rates. The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, while growth rates are based on management's experience and expectations and do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the area in which the CGU operates. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates. The weighted average growth rates are consistent with forecasts and the discount rates are pre-tax.\n\n\tNo impairment charges were recognised in 2006 (2005: £nil).\n\n\n\n\n\t \tGrowth rate1\tDiscount rate2\n\t\tWeighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.\n\tPre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.\n\n\n\tUK \t3.4% \t9.3% \n\tGermany \t3.5% \t9.3% \n\tRest of Western Europe \t5.1% \t9.3% \n\tRest of the World \t7.2% \t9.3%\n\n\n\n\n\tAcquisition of Davidoff cigarette trademark\n\n\tOn 5 September 2006, the Group acquired the worldwide Davidoff cigarette trademark for a cash consideration of £368m. The Group had been the long term licensee of the trademark following the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002. Given the global growth potential of the brand, the Directors consider that the Davidoff cigarette trademark has an indefinite life and it is therefore not subject to amortisation. It is, however, subject to an annual impairment review under the requirements of IAS 36.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t10 Property, plant and equipment\n\n\n\n\t2006\tProperty \tPlant and equipment \tFixtures and motor vehicles \tTotal \n\t(In £'s million) \n\tCost \t \n\tAs at 1 October 2005 \t166 \t776 \t151 \t1,093 \n\tExchange movements \t(2) \t(14) \t(1) \t(17) \n\tReclassifications \t– \t(2) \t2 \t– \n\tAcquisitions (note 24) \t– \t1 \t1 \t2 \n\tAdditions \t2 \t52 \t21 \t75 \n\tDisposals \t(9) \t(33) \t(15) \t(57) \n\tAs at 30 September 2006 \t157\t780\t159\t1,096\n\t \n\tAccumulated depreciation \t \n\tAs at 1 October 2005 \t3 \t370 \t78 \t451 \n\tExchange movements \t– \t(5) \t(1) \t(6) \n\tCharge for the year \t6 \t67 \t21 \t94 \n\tImpairment \t6 \t10 \t1 \t17 \n\tDisposals \t(3) \t(27) \t(10) \t(40) \n\tAs at 30 September 2006 \t12\t415\t89\t516\n\t \n\tNet book value\t \n\tAs at 30 September 2006\t145\t365\t70\t580\n\tAs at 1 October 2005\t163\t406\t73\t642\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2005\tProperty \tPlant and equipment \tFixtures and motor vehicles \tTotal \n\t(In £'s million) \n\tCost \t \t \t \t \n\tAs at 1 October 2004 \t189 \t751 \t129 \t1,069 \n\tExchange movements \t4 \t12 \t2 \t18 \n\tReclassifications \t6 \t(8) \t2 \t– \n\tAdditions \t2 \t69 \t21 \t92 \n\tDisposals \t(35) \t(48) \t(3) \t(86) \n\t As at 30 September 2005 \t166\t776\t151\t1,093\n\t \n\tAccumulated depreciation\t \t \t \t \n\tAs at 1 October 2004 \t7 \t337 \t60 \t404 \n\tExchange movements \t1 \t6 \t1 \t8 \n\tReclassifications \t– \t(1) \t1 \t– \n\tCharge for the year \t7 \t59 \t16 \t82 \n\tImpairment \t– \t13 \t– \t13 \n\tDisposals \t(12) \t(44) \t– \t(56) \n\tAs at 30 September 2005 \t3\t370\t78\t451\n\t \n\tNet book value\t \n\tAs at 30 September 2005\t163\t406\t73\t642\n\tAs at 1 October 2004\t182\t414\t69\t665\n\n\n\nLand and buildings at net book value:\t(In £'s million) \t2006 \t2005 \n\tFreehold \t133 \t151 \n\tLong leasehold \t12 \t12 \n\t \t145 \t163\n\n\n\n\tAssets with a net book value of £1m (2005: £1m) are pledged as security for liabilities.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t11 Investments in associates\n\n\n\t(In £'s million) \t2006 \t2005 \n\tAs at 1 October \t5 \t7 \n\tImpairments \t– \t(2) \n\tAs at 30 September\t5 \t5 \n\n\n\n\tNone of the associates is considered to be significant to the Group.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t12 Inventories\n\n\n\t(In £'s million) \t2006 \t2005 \n\tRaw materials \t259 \t301 \n\tWork in progress \t14 \t16 \n\tFinished inventories \t410 \t407 \n\tOther inventories \t106 \t133 \n\t \t789 \t857\n\n\n\n\n\tOther inventories comprise mainly duty-paid tax stamps.\n\n\tIt is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.

The All Party Parliamentary Group on Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction (APPGITA) was asked to assist in the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Misuse (APPDMG) inquiry into ?physical dependence and addiction to prescription and over the counter medicine.?? As a result seven people attended an evidence session to give oral evidence on Tranquilliser addition and 40 people submitted written evidence.\n\n\n\n??? The oral evidence session was very successful.? Professor Heather Ashton (Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychopharmacology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), an expert on Benzodiazepine addiction gave evidence; Pam Armstrong of the Council on Information on Tranquiliser and Anti-Depressants (CITA) and Una Corbett of Battle against Tranquillisers (BAT) who both run charitable organisations providing Tranquilliser withdrawal services gave evidence; and also ex-Involuntary Tranquilliser Addicts Barry Haslam and Michael Behan.\n\n\n\n??? However, upon reading a draft of the report we decided to disassociate ourselves from it and prepare this alternative version on Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, in order to provide a critique of the APPDMG report and make alternative recommendations.? We were disappointed to see that those writing the report had misunderstood the Tranquilliser issue.? They had ignored much of the evidence put before them and substituted their own ideas.? These ideas correspond very closely to the Department of Health misconceptions on Tranquillisers which have led to the present situation described by one witness to the enquiry, Milly Kieve of the Charity APRIL as a ?Public Health Emergency.?\n\n\n\n?? We felt that the official report did not reflect the contributions on Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction and that more detail of the evidence presented was required together with more specific recommendations.? The aim of the All Party Group on Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction is to focus the Department of Health on the 1.5 million people who have had their lives and careers ruined by addiction to prescribed medication..\n\n\n\n??????? We are also concerned with the effect Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction is having upon the workforce.? Tranquilliser side effects, withdrawal symptoms and post withdrawal syndrome can render a person unfit for work and as a result they are on long term incapacity benefits.? This is an unnecessary cost to the economy which we have asked the Department of Works and Pensions to consider. \n\n\n\nInvoluntary Tranquilliser Addiction\n\n\n\n??? The APPDMG report?s definition of involuntary addiction is wrong as far as Tranquilliser addiction is concerned:\n\n\n\n??? ?The term involuntary addiction has been coined by some experts and patient groups to describe the type of drug dependence which has occurred through medication taken initially to treat a medical condition (and often under medical supervision) but to which the patient has subsequently become dependent.? (p.9)1\n\n\n\n??? Firstly, for involuntary Tranquilliser addiction in the U.K., addiction is always under the supervision of the doctors who prescribe the medication.? Secondly, doctors do not always give Tranquillisers to treat a medical condition. They also give them for a variety of other inappropriate reasons, e.g. bereavement; toothache; divorce.? Thirdly, and most importantly, the Tranquilliser is given without the patient?s informed consent as the dangers associated with the Tranquilliser have not been explained by the prescriber to the patient.? \n\n\n\nContext\n\n\n\n??? The report claims to be ?setting the context? and ?defining the problem? but fails to do either.\n\n\n\n??? Defining the problem properly and accurately is essential if correct solutions are ever to be introduced by government.\n\n\n\n1)????? ?The report does not mention the bizarre, intense and painful side effects that people experience whilst on Tranquillisers.? Over 200 have been listed, and addicts often suffer 30 or 40 of them.4\n\n\n\n2)????? The report does not mention the Tranquilliser post-withdrawal syndrome3 in which painful symptoms persist for many years and are sometimes permanent.? Side-effects and post-withdrawal syndrome are common amongst Tranquilliser addicts and extremely debilitating to the extent that ex-addicts are unable to work.? Both Barry Haslam and Michael Behan gave verbal evidence to the enquiry on this point and many others have produced written evidence e.g. Colin Downes-Grainger4.? The two Tranquilliser case studies paraphrased by the report contain no mention of side-effects or post-withdrawal; the Department of Health also refuses to acknowledge post withdrawal or permanent damage.\n\n\n\n3)????? The report makes no mention of Tranquilliser deaths.? Professor Ashton has calculated, from Home Office yearly figures 2 that 17,000 Tranquilliser deaths have occurred during the last 50 years, including road traffic accidents and overdoses.? The Department of Health have refused to acknowledge this figure. \n\n\n\n4)????? The report acknowledges the withdrawal syndrome but does not mention the prolonged withdrawal period.? The addiction created by Tranquillisers is so strong that safe and successful withdrawal can take from six months to two years.? Again the Department of Health does not acknowledge safe withdrawal time frames.\n\n\n\n5)????? The impression given by the report is that the first warning of a problem with Tranquillisers was on the Esther Rantzen Show, in 1985 but in fact there were danger signals with Benzodiazepine from when Librium was first introduced in the United States in 1961, only the Department of Health and their licensing authority did not see them.\n\nThe original clinical trials5 for Benzodiazepine conducted by Roche show the addictiveness and toxicity of these drugs.? Valium, Librium and Serax adverts in United States? medical journals carried serious warnings throughout the 60s and 70s. Data sheets for Benzodiazepines in Canada, the United States, Australia, and Scandinavia also contained high level warnings.\nIn 1964 the W.H.O. Expert Committee on Dependence Producing Drugs6 identified the first Benzodiazepine (Librium) as capable of producing ?dependence of the barbiturate type.?\n\nNevertheless when the drug licensing system was introduced in the U.K. in 1972 the Benzodiazepines were awarded ?Licences of Right? with no assessment of safety or efficacy. \n\nIn 1972 the U.K. Monopolies Commission7 investigated Roche Products for profiteering on the sale of Benzodiazepine to the NHS.? This resulted in the repayment of several million pounds.? In 1979 the U.S.A. Senate Sub-Committee on Health8 conducted an enquiry into Benzodiazepine use and misuse.\n\nFrom 1986-1995 the Benzodiazepine litigation was the largest class action ever in the English legal system with. Over 17,000 litigants claimed damages against the manufacturers, only to be defeated by 10 years of procedural motions and delaying tactics by the defendants.? This is the context of the Tranquilliser problem, not the Esther Rantzen Show in 1985.\n\n\n\n6)????? The report claims to be in agreement with the report by the Parliament of the State of Victoria in Australia but the Australian report enquired into voluntary addiction only and made no investigation or recommendations on I.T.A.\n\n\n\n7)????? The report claims on Page 19 that ?prescription rates of benzodiazepine are beginning to fall gradually?, but fails to mention that total Tranquilliser prescriptions have increased due to the introduction of the ?Zed? drugs such as Zopiclone, which have a similar action to the Benzodiazepines, and are even more toxic and addictive.? The latest Diazepam figures from the Department of Health show an increase in prescriptions.11\n\n\n\n8)????? The report casts doubt upon Professor Ashton?s tapering withdrawal method from Benzodiazepines.9? This has been used successfully worldwide for many years and is based on an understanding of the highly addictive properties of Tranquillisers.? Abrupt withdrawal (cold turkey) from Tranquillisers is a common mistake made by badly informed doctors.? It is a result of Doctors thinking the Tranquillisers are not particularly addictive and that the patient?s supposed ?addictive personality? must be the problem.? Abrupt withdrawal is likely to be unsuccessful, is extremely painful for the patient, can cause fits, convulsions, and psychosis, and can result in permanent damage.\n\nThe report does not give any evidence to support its opinion on tapered withdrawal.\n\n\n\n9)????? The report discusses what it calls the issue of ?prenatal exposure? to Benzodiazepines and toxicity or withdrawal effects in the baby.? The authors cast doubt upon this without providing any evidence to support their opinions.? They refrain from even using the term ?Benzo Baby? or discussing the real issue which is damage to the unborn child caused by Tranquillisers.? The authors provide as a reference for their opinions (No. 32) the BENZACT website of Susan Tuke.? Susan Tuke is an experienced and well-known Tranquilliser campaigner and has compiled the overwhelming scientific evidence of Tranquilliser damage to the unborn and placed it on her BENZACT website. It is inappropriate for the report to use her website as a reference for their opposite point of view.\n\nDamaged babies were common knowledge in the early 1990?s, with an entry in the second edition (1981) of Davies?s Textbook of Adverse Drug Reactions.14\n\nThe report is well in step with the Department of Health on this issue.? The Department of Health have consistently refused to accept the damage to the unborn caused by Tranquillisers.? Most famously John Hutton M.P., then Minister for Health, told a debate in 1999 in Westminster Hall on ?The Benzodiazepines? that: ?I understand and am currently advised that there is no proven link between Benzodiazepine use and damage to developing foetuses?10 ? but did not provide any evidence.\n\nAccording to Professor Ashton in her withdrawal manual, Benzodiazepines ?cross the placenta, and if taken regularly by the mother in late pregnancy, even in therapeutic doses, can cause neonatal complications.? The foetus and neonate metabolise benzodiazepines very slowly, and appreciable concentrations may persist in the infant up to two weeks after birth, resulting in the ?floppy infant syndrome? of lax muscles, oversedation, and failure to suckle. Withdrawal symptoms may develop after about two weeks with hyperexcitability, high pitched crying and feeding difficulties.\n\n?Benzodiazepines in therapeutic doses appear to carry little risk of causing major congenital malformations.? However, chronic maternal use may impair foetal intrauterine growth and retard brain development.? There is increasing concern that such children in later life may be prone to attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity, learning difficulties, and a spectrum of autistic disorders.?9\n\n\n\n10)? Professor Ashton is an expert on Tranquillisers and Tranquilliser withdrawal.? She appeared before the enquiry and gave oral evidence. The authors of the report made reference to three different aspects (24, 29, 36) of her work ?diversion of Benzodiazepines to illegal users; withdrawal protocol; and a number of illicit Benzodiazepine users mixing alcohol and Benzodiazepines.? However, they completely ignore the substance of her work and evidence on involuntary Tranquilliser addiction.\n\nProfessor Ashton?s work explains that Benzodiazepines are highly addictive and powerful drugs which are misunderstood by the Department of Health and the medical profession.? They have numerous (200+) severe side effects and are extensively misused by the medical profession in the U.K. and elsewhere.? A population of involuntary addicts has existed since the 1960?s which has never been treated by the NHS; Tranquilliser Withdrawal is a complex and difficult process which requires expert help and support.\n\nThe report claims, without citing any evidence, that many Benzodiazepine patients have ?co-existing mental health problems? (p.21), although this is the opposite of Professor Ashton?s view. ?Her work shows that Benzodiazepines interfere with the chemistry of the mind and produce mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, agoraphobia and aggression, as side effects and withdrawal symptoms.? The report gives no other reference for their mental health claim.? Again the report follows the Department of Health on this point.? The Department of Health regularly stigmatizes Tranquilliser addicts in this way.\n\nProfessor Ashton has read our alternative report and endorses our version.\n\n\n\n11)? The report makes no mention of the planned and deliberate causes of the Tranquilliser problem.? The origin of the Benzodiazepine Tranquilliser problem was the unprecedented marketing campaign by manufacturers Roche Products throughout the 60?s and 70?s.? Roche organised on one hand a disease mongering campaign which redefined the emotion of anxiety as a medical condition and on the other hand presented their Benzodiazepine as the new wonder drug, safe and effective, for anxiety and almost any other medical condition.? Valium became the highest value drug blockbuster in history.? The original Benzodiazepine clinical trials conducted by Roche in the 1950s show they knew from the beginning of the problems associated with the use of these drugs.\n\nThe explanation of the overuse offered by the APPDMG report is: ?because benzodiazepines were very favourably received by most patients.?1 (p. 7) This claim is unreferenced and it is a stigmatisation of involuntary Tranquilliser addicts.? The Department of Health also regularly blames Tranquilliser patients for their own addiction by referring to them as drug misusers.\n\nBenzodiazepines became almost overnight the ?most widely prescribed of all prescription medicines,? not because they were favourably received by most patients as the report states, but because they were so highly addictive that patients needed to maintain their addictions.\n\n\n\n50 Years of Tranquillisers\n\n\n\n\n\n??? With the number of deaths, the limited efficacy, the ruined lives and the cost of these to the economy, why does the government and the Department of Health in particular refuse to accept the magnitude of the problem and refuse to provide treatment and rehabilitation to those who have been made drug addicts??? We believe the relevant question to ask and which should have been asked by the enquiry is:\n\n?Why has the Tranquilliser scandal been allowed to continue for nearly 50 years?\n\n\n\n??? We believe that the explanations lie within government, not within faults and weaknesses attributed to patients. The Tranquilliser problem is not just a medical problem it is a political problem as well.? We believe that large-scale ITA continues.? because of ?the influence on Department of Health policy by the Pharmaceutical Companies and ?fear of the financial cost of possible compensation for those damaged.\n\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\n\n?? Many victims believe they are entitled to compensation, so too did the Health Minister Dawn Primarolo M.P. when she asked for the introduction of a compensation scheme in 1989.13\n\n??? Only one person has managed to obtain compensation from the Pharmaceutical Companies for Tranquilliser addiction.? Iain Caldwell in Scotland received a no liability settlement of over ?100,000 for alleged addiction to Roche Product?s ?Mogadon (Nitrazepam) after a 13 year legal battle.\n\n??? We would like to suggest a solution to the compensation issue; a no-fault compensation scheme such as the one in New Zealand in which many Tranquilliser victims have been compensated.? This should be funded by the pharmaceutical companies.? The gambling industry pays a levy into a fund to help people damaged by gambling, the alcohol industry pays a similar levy.? The same levy system should also apply to the pharmaceutical industry, to fund a compensation scheme.\n\n? We believe the APPDMG report was a wasted opportunity.? The Tranquilliser problem has to be properly described in order to produce a solution.? People had their expectations raised by the enquiry, spent time and effort writing submissions and travelling to London to give evidence.? The APPDMG report has ignored this evidence and instead provided us with a mixture of the authors? personal opinions and the Department of Health?s existing policy.\n\n??? We have compiled a list of alternative recommendations based on the evidence to the enquiry.\n\n\n\nAlternative Recommendations arising from the APPDMG Inquiry \n\n\n\nTreatment:\n\n\n\n1)????? In the treatment section of Recommendations the report suggests ?Help from GP?s? (5.1) and ?appropriate treatment by PCT. (5.2)? The Department of Health claims these services are already provided, so the report is really recommending the status quo as far as tranquiliser withdrawal is concerned.\n\nThe recommendation for ?specialist advice clinics? (5.2) is new but is not specific enough.? Firstly, any services should be on an outreach basis.? Doctors should examine their records to identify all patients prescribed outside the guidelines.? These patients should be sent full information? on their tranquiliser medication, offered an appointment to discuss the issue and the option to be referred for withdrawal.\n\nThe term ?appropriate treatment? (5.2.) used in the recommendations is not helpful and could be taken to mean ?maintenance treatment? or transfer to other drugs rather than withdrawal.\n\nSecondly, the Department of Health needs to develop a best practice on withdrawal and shall draw on the experience and expertise of the successful charitable organisations, CITA, BAT and others.? Also the Department of Health needs advice from them on staff training, rehabilitation, and other aspects of providing these services.\n\nThirdly, local clinics are needed in each area, because of the large number of people involved. Introducing tranquiliser withdrawal services would be an enormous logistical exercises involving the processing and de-toxification of large groups of people.? Regional residential clinics are needed for more difficult cases.\n\n2)????? NHS funded local support groups.? Experience has shown that these are extremely useful to support withdrawal from Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction.? Internet sites are not useful for Tranquilliser Withdrawal.\n\n3)????? NHS funded 24-hour national Tranquilliser helpline.? CITA has experience in this field.\n\n4)????? Regional residential clinics for severe addiction.? Withdrawal from Tranquillisers can be extremely difficult with severe and multiple physical and mental withdrawal symptoms.\n\n5)????? Training courses for specialised Tranquilliser withdrawal counsellors.? Ex-addicts are good candidates as counsellors.? The voluntary groups have experience of providing training.\n\n\n\nMedical Research:\n\n\n\nMedical Research sponsored by the Department of Health into the mechanism of how the drugs cause damage.? There is no known treatment for the damage to addicts from Tranquillisers.\n\n\n\nQuantification of the Tranquilliser Problem:\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health should compile official statistics on aspects of the problem, such as:\n\na)????? The number of addicts\n\nb)????? The duration of addiction and withdrawal\n\nc)????? The number of ex-addicts\n\nd)????? The proportion of ex-addicts permanently damaged.\n\ne)????? The correlation of involuntary Tranquilliser addiction with incapacity benefit.\n\nf)???????

The OC and PCB compounds are highly soluble in the solvents we use and are extracted from the tissue into the liquid solvent. \n\n\t  This extraction process also removes other compounds such as fat from the tissue therefore we have to clean up the resulting sample. We use open column chromatography to separate the OCs and PCBs from the interfering fat. The extract containing the OCs and PCBs is collected and analysed by gas chromatography with Electron Capture Detection (GC-ECD). This provides us with a chromatogram for each sample. To identify the various OC and PCB compounds in a sample we first analyse a calibration standard containing each of the compounds we are interested in. We can then compare the standard chromatogram with those obtained from our samples. \n\n\t  \n\n\t  \n\n\t  Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARS) \n\n\t  As with the OC and PCB method the tissue sample is homogenised and extracted using a mixture containing chloroform and acetone. These organic solvents are chosen because they are ones in which the rodenticide compounds are most soluble in. The resulting solution is cleaned up to remove any fats which may affect the analysis; this is done using solid phase extraction. The cleaned sample is then analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using fluorescence detection. By comparing the sample chromatogram with one obtained from analysing a calibration standard we can confirm the occurrence of any rodenticides in the sample and calculate the amount present.\n\n\t  \n\n\t  Mercury \n\n\t  Concentrated nitric acid is added to the sample; this is heated to 120oC to breakdown the tissue and release any mercury into solution. The acid solution is subsequently diluted with de-ionised water and the resulting solution is analysed using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). To calculate the amount of mercury present in a sample we compare the sample results with those obtained by analysing calibration standards. \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t  \n\t    « Which species are analysed?\n\n\t  \n\n\t  Why are we interested in these chemicals? »\n\n\t  \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Home\n\n      News\n\n      Birds and Eggs \n\n      Sending samples \n\n      Results & Publications \n\n      Links\n\n      Contacts  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\t  \n\n\t  This site was developed by the Biological Records Centre, CEH © 2006\n\n  \n\n   \n\n",

Since then over £400,000 has been raised from over 250 donors, ranging from large corporate charities to private individuals and local-history groups.\n From 1998 to 2004 the Trust funded two team researchers in Oxfordshire. It is currently funding a 0.8fte research post, as well as contributing to Oxfordshire's EPE projects. The Trust also helps to raise the VCH's profile through events and lectures, in particular hosting an annual Christmas lecture and reception for local supporters.\n \nLink: Oxfordshire VCH Trust \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2007 England's Past for Everyone, Victoria County History \n\nDisclaimer\n\t\t| Site map\n\t\t| Contact Us\n\nPage most recently updated on 25 April, 2007\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t",

The doorways, constructed of painted brick referencing the older parts of the Bluecoat’s architecture. Natural light filters into the large galley through french windows in the cloister which open onto our celebrated garden.\nThe third gallery on the ground floor at the rear of the wing looks out onto Church Lane through three large floor-to-ceiling windows and a glass door. Significantly, this gallery is the most visible and public space of the arts wing.\nThe final gallery, located on the first floor at the rear of the wing, accessible by stairs and lift, is a truly special space. With three sizable box windows projecting about a metre out into Church Lane, the space also receives natural light from a lofty skylight that runs the entire length of the arts wing. The skylight tops a pitched ceiling that emphasizes the verticality of the space and adds a sense of drama to the room. The tall window wall features painted brick construction, and there are three dedicated display walls.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t...Go Back\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGallery Mode\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright of the Bluecoat | Design and Development by Musgrave and Nonconform\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But Green voters are doing more than registering their dislike of Lab/Con policies; they are registering their approval of Green policies and hoping the Green candidate wins. \n\nTwo main threads have run through the political commentator’s minds in the run-up to Thursday. One is that we should vote, civic duty and so on. \n\nThe other is Bunting’s point (most often made with regard to the BNP) that voters are alienated and lashing out at the biggest parties. The result is that we are told indirectly that sensible folk will vote and vote establishment (the Guardian, daringly, going for the semi-establishment Lib Dem). \n\nBut this is a horribly self-fulfilling argument with no basis in reality.  Now, for once we have democracy, red in tooth and claw. For once voters are not forced to choose between the bland rhetorical differences of the major parties but are freed by their anger to vote with their beliefs. The narrow oligopoly has a chance of being broken with the Greens, UKIP and the BNP, among others, all more hopeful than they will have been for years. \n\nFor commentators to dismiss votes for these parties as an irrelevant protest, good only for shaking up the proper parties, is condescending and counter-productive. In the last parliament we saw two ostensibly liberal parties vote so illiberally that Liberty became the most talked about pressure group. \n\nMaybe a smattering of Green, UKIP and even BNP MPs would reinvigorate our parliament in a way no amount of Red/Blue/Yellow musical chairs could (this is not to say that the Lib Dems have failed like the other two big parties, simply that more diversity is needed, rather yellow replacing red). \n\nWe know that on Thursday all the smaller parties should do well and that the BNP might gain a European seat, and thus European funding. Perhaps this is why Guardian commentators are now attempting to push us to the Lib Dems. Perhaps Bunting made a tactical decision to knock the Greens in an attempt to consolidate the Guardian vote for the Lib Dems.\n\nAnother symptom of this dismissiveness is seen in the abusive disdain to which the BNP is subjected. Racist though it clearly is, many BNP supporters do not consider themselves or the party to be racist. Once they have reconciled themselves with the media’s (in their opinion erroneous) portrayal of them as racist there is no more criticism of the party’s ideas. They are left in peace to conflate each other’s opinions, their ‘racist’ label easily shrugged off. \n\nWith PR in place for the European elections many parties will gain seats and so all should be scrutinised. It is disappointing after all the vitriol spat at MPs over expenses that the best that the free thinking Guardian could do is back the Lib Dems and mock the Greens.\n\n————\n\nDavid Birchall is an unemployed, newly qualified journalist who is starting to think he picked the wrong time for a career change.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t· About the author: This is a guest post.\n\n\n\t\n· Other posts by Guest\n\n\n\n· About this article:\n\n\n\t   |  \n\tTrackback link   |   \n\tTrack comments   |   \n\tsend to del.icio.us   |  \n\tto Facebook\n\t\nFiled under: Blog , Green party , Media , Westminster\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n13 Comments in response   ||    Add your own\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 2:31 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t1.  comment by \n      Tinter\n\n\tWell, I don’t have time to take on the post as a whole since its the day before an election. I will just say that yes, many people do vote green because they support the greens. Many people also vote Green as a protest vote. People do and will vote for smaller parties just to express anger at the larger parties. The “semi-establishment” Lib Dems thrive on this so its not like its some kind of belittiling attack, its just how some people vote.\n\nAlso, this is D’Hondt, not pure PR! A Green vote in, say, the North East or Wales is as useful as a Green vote there in parliamentary elections- which is to say not very. Of course, its fine to just go out and vote for the party you believe in- if everyone just did that we would probably have a better government. But from a tactical perspective, there will only be a few parties in your region with a chance of winning, Euro Elections don’t free you from these pressures.\n\nAlso, you keep assigning motives to people for not endorsing the greens. Maybe they just prefer the Lib Dems? Even you exempted or diminished much of your criticism of them, and when some of you science policy was slammed in the guardian your own deputy leader appeared to comment it was moronic and we should just ignore it as their MEP’s will. There doesn’t need to be a conspiracy for people not to pick your party to support.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 3:07 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t2.  comment by \n      James\n\n\tCitation for the deputy leader “moronic’ comment please?\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 3:32 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t3.  comment by \n      Shatterface\n\n\tMost Green votes will by people who would rather stab Brown in the eye with their pen but find voting against him the closest they can get: same with BNP voters. \n\nAny argument the Greens make about the Euros showing that the UK is turning Eco can also be used by the BNP to demonstrate we hate Johnny Foreigner. \n\nStill, a protest vote’s still a vote and I’d rather it went to hippies than fascists. \n\nLabour is going to get butt-fucked because of their unpopularity, not because Left or Right-wing parties have won the argument.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 4:10 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t4.  comment by \n      Strategist\n\n\tI totally disagree with Shatterface@3.  \n\nFirst Past the Post elections require people to vote tactically, and they most certainly do that in vast numbers.  And so they provide no reliable baseline evidence of the real level of “first choice” rather than “best available in the circumstances” support for the parties.  \n\nOur closed list PR elections (albeit highly imperfect, Tinter’s point @1 is well taken) offer a more reliable sense of where people’s real first preferences lie.  In London (don’t know about Scotland & Wales) the Assembly top-up ballot showed relatively little divergence between the Euro results and the Assembly results.  It may be true that in both elections support for the minor parties was boosted by the perception that both London Assembly and Euro parliament ultimately have little power and are therefore “safe” for a protest vote.  But I would bet my bottom bippy that the extent to which this overstates minor party support is dwarfed by the extent to which FPTP hides the real level of support for alternatives.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 6:22 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t5.  comment by \n      Tinter\n\n\tMy apologies for the comment on the Green Party Deputy Leader, which would be Adrian Ramsay. That comment was made, but my Adam Ramsay, a Scottish Green Party Euro Candidate. Obviously I am very sorry I did not check things out properly before posting, the confusion is probably understandable but not acceptable when making an attack.\n\nNonetheless, the place I took it from was http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/06/political-science-be-careful-what-you-vote-for.html\n\nIn the comments below both Adam and the Scottish Green Parties deputy leader lay into some England and Wales Green Party policies. Obviously they are members of another party- but they are also greens and I think it does show that you can support Green issues and still have problems with many, many things contained in MFSS and other Green Party policy documents. And I’m not refering just to the points made in the linked article. GPEW is for example much less supportive of Europe, markets and disagrees with most continental Green Parties on a lot of issues.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 7:54 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t6.  comment by \n      David Birchall\n\n\tTinter, my point was that commentators belittle small parties too readily, enforcing the idea that it’s either a Tory or a Labour government. Were they to treat all parties on their merits rather than their current size politics would be livelier and more accessible to those who views are not well represented.\n\nI never made a comment as to which party I support, mentioned tactical voting or criticised the Lib Dems because that is all completely irrelevant to the article.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 8:07 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t7.  comment by \n      Trofim\n\n\tStrategist: In London (don’t know about Scotland & Wales) . . .\n\nStrategist, if you are in London and walk far enough in any direction, you come to a place called England. Hardly anybody lives there, though.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 8:42 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t8.  comment by \n      James\n\n\tTinter, you’re wrong again. \n\nAdam Ramsay, assuming it’s the same Adam Ramsay, is a Scottish party member, but he’s not a candidate. Our election candidates are Elaine Morrison, Chas Booth, Kirsten Robb, Alastair Whitelaw Ruth Dawkins & Peter McColl.\n\nThere has been some debate about the science/health aspects of policy, and I personally don’t believe in homeopathy, but to go from that to imply broad disagreements in the party/parties is a real stretch.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 8:46 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t9.  comment by \n      Tinter\n\n\tDavid- You took a view of protest voting in your article- all of my comments were related to that. Its a real phenomenon, and is related to things like tactical voting. All of my discussion was aimed at issues around protest voting and votes for small parties, which takes up a lot of you article, so I don’t think it was unrelated.\n\nAs for media coverage- I don’t think thats the case. Simply managing to stand candidates does not make a group of equal importance or weight to the public. Do the Jury Team and No2EU, heading for desultory votes and with almost no active supporters, deserve equal coverage? I don’t see why the public should be interested in them because they don’t matter.\n\nParties with ~5,000 members and some elected representatives deserve more, yes. But they are unlikely to even be involved in running local councils, never mind the government. So how can they be of as much interest?\n\nThe largest decisions lie with Labour and the Convervatives. The membership bases of both (labour less so nowdays but nonetheless…) have several times more members. The actions of these parties are clearly of more interest to the public than the lib dems, greens, UKIP or anyone else. Its not at all unreasonable for media coverage to reflect that fact.\n\nAs to the lib dems, you felt the need to invent motivations for the Guardian to endorse the Lib Dems. And invent absurd lines of reasoning for Bunting to… call for a vote for the Greens in language you feel didn’t make adequate pretense of them being competitors in more than 2 parliamentary seats? I think thats enough for a paragraph response.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 9:57 pm on June 3, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t10.  comment by \n      Andy Gilmour\n\n\tSurely the fact that the original article was by MADELEINE BUNTING should have been sufficient warning to approach with extreme caution?\n\nEven if she hits upon something that appears sensible, it’s only ever by accident.\n\nHo hum.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 1:59 am on June 4, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t11.  comment by \n      Strategist\n\n\t@ 7 Trofim: “if you are in London and walk far enough in any direction, you come to a place called England. Hardly anybody lives there, though.”\n\n…and nobody whatsoever there gets to vote in a PR election outside of the quinquennial Euro elections.  So there’s not much chance of comparing people’s behaviour in terms of protest voting in local-vs-Euro PR elections, which was the subject of my post, if you’d bothered to read it, rather than getting the hump about an imagined slight to your provincial sensibilties.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 5:59 pm on June 4, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t12.  comment by \n      Nina\n\n\tGreen voters are doing more than registering their dislike of Lab/Con policies; they are registering their approval of Green policies and hoping the Green candidate wins.\n\n\nThe party political system means that for most of us our vote is a compromise. I may vote Green but that certainly doesn’t mean I approve of all of their policies, rather that I would prefer to have them in the European parliament than members of the other parties. It’s foolish to ignore that because you might start to believe that people condone everything a party does when they vote for them and that simply isn’t accurate. I don’t approve of some of the Green party science policy but I vote in spite of this because the compromise is more practical from my point of view.  Could I do so in a general election in light of the statements made on embryonic stem cell policy by a Green Party spokesperson this week? Probably not.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tat 9:21 pm on June 4, 2009\n- direct link -   \n\n\t13.  comment by \n      Charlieman\n\n\tTo follow on from Nina’s point. Quality and longevity of human life has improved enormously since the industrial revolution. Or whenever. Science and engineering have allowed us to increase human numbers, to feed them adequately and to provide lifestyles beyond past imagination. Liberal lefties acknowledge inequality and wish to correct it, similarly seeking to identify technologies that optimally benefit all human kind. By contrast, the manifesto of the Green Party undermines medicine, and precludes nuclear energy and GM crops. I’m dubious about both of the latter but I expect a serious evaluation.\n\nHumans may, or may not, be the cause of global warming. For the people who will die or lose their homes when their islands are swallowed by the ocean, the cause is unimportant. The Green Party talks all the time about reducing carbon emissions and country targets, which aren’t going to be achieved anyway, and even if they are achieved they may not prevent the rise of sea levels. So what are the Greens going to say? I am sorry that your land disappeared but I did switch off my mobile phone charger every night.\n\nI have had a go at the Greens, but the same question can be asked of greens in all parties. Given that oceans will rise, what are you going to do about the South Sea islanders? After the homes of Gaugin and Robert Louis Stevenson have been preserved at heritage sites, are you planning anything else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a comment using the form below\n\n\n\n\t\tWe have a tight comments policy aimed at fostering constructive debate.\n\tWe believe in free speech but not your right to abuse our space. \n\tAbusive, sarcastic or silly comments may be deleted.\n\tMisogynist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments will be deleted.\n\tPlease familiarise yourself with our comments policy.\n\n\n\n\n Name (required)\n\n\n Mail (will not be published) (required)\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tNotify me of followup comments via e-mail\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\tFeatured blogs \n\n\n\n\tConor Foley\n\n\t\nWhy listen to Nick Cohen?\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\tSunny Hundal\n\n\t\nBlogging and sleaze\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tExclusive\n\n\t\nPolicy Exchange sorry!\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\tRecently popular\n\n\t\t  I'm taking a test tonight\n (154 replies)\n\n  Melanie Phillips: the thick or nasty dilemma\n (112 replies)\n\n  Open borders, not just amnesty, for migrants\n (111 replies)\n\n  What Dale didn't mention\n (90 replies)\n\n  Dr George Tiller murdered by 'pro life' terrorists\n (83 replies)\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLatest comments\n\n\t\t » Tinter posted on The good side to resignations\n\n » Tinter posted on The good side to resignations\n\n » Lee Griffin posted on The good side to resignations\n\n » Unity posted on The case against First Past the Post\n\n » Left Outside posted on The case against First Past the Post\n\n » Lee Griffin posted on The case against First Past the Post\n\n » Lee Griffin posted on The case against First Past the Post\n\n » BenSix posted on Obama's secret plan to convert America revealed!\n\n » Shamit posted on The good side to resignations\n\n » Left Outside posted on Why I’ll be voting Green on June 4\n\n » Why Universities need a say… « Left Outside posted on The case against First Past the Post\n\n » Tinter posted on Their shameless hunger for power\n\n » just visiting posted on Obama's secret plan to convert America revealed!\n\n » just visiting posted on Moderate Muslims fight back\n\n » Shatterface posted on Their shameless hunger for power\n\n\t\t  Last 50 // Comments feed\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLiberal Conspiracy is a joint effort. © Copyright 2007 - 2009.

Drivers need to be fit, relaxed and rested for the demands of safe travel. Good driving requires a responsible attitude to other road users as well as a high level of concentration, observation and anticipation. The reality is, however, that everyone makes mistakes. \n\n        Our attitude as drivers, how we deal with our own mistakes and our reaction to those made by other people, will influence our own safety and well-being and that of other road users around us.\n\n        Aggressive, selfish or impatient attitudes influence the way we drive. This can develop into a tendency to take irresponsible risks, such as tailgating, exceeding speed limits, undertaking, or jumping red lights. \n\n        Our emotional mood also influences our behaviour; drivers commonly express how they feel in the way they drive. Traffic delays and congestion can also influence our frame of mind. Life stresses such as relationship anxieties, financial or employment problems, domestic or workplace arguments (to highlight only a few) influence our mood and can affect our attitude to driving and safety behind the wheel.\n\n        Many drivers find different ways to keep calm but here are some suggestions on dealing with, and avoiding, potential conflict, “road rage” or red mist.\n\n        Before You Set Off\n\n          \n\n        \n\n        \tWhen we are emotionally upset or psychologically caught up in something else, we are not able to give the road our full attention and so, do not drive safely. Try to ensure you are in a calm, good mood before driving. \n\n\n        \tPlan time into journeys in case you are delayed by traffic; this can help to alleviate the pressure you feel if you’re running late. \n\n            \n\n\n        \n\n          During Your Journey\n\n        \tWhilst driving do not over-react to, or panic about, another driver’s error, bad driving or poor attitude. They may be unaware of their actions. Try to stay away from them and concentrate on driving well and within the law. \n\n\n        \tAvoid getting into conflict with another driver. There will be some bad drivers who are looking for a reaction or conflict. “Competing” with another driver could lead to the incident becoming serious. Keep your mind focused on your driving.\n\n\n        \tStay calm and think logically – when confronted by an irate driver don’t engage in gestures, headlight flashing or sounding the horn as this will serve no purpose and may exacerbate the situation. It will also distract you. Concentrate on driving responsibly.\n\n\n        \tRefrain from eye contact with an angry or aggressive driver as this has the potential to make the situation worse.\n\n            \n\n\n\tIf you find you are being followed by an impatient driver (tailgated) – do not allow yourself to be “pushed” along, intimidated or made to increase your speed. Without actually pulling over or stopping – find a safe opportunity to allow that driver to pass. Circumnavigating a roundabout to enable a tailgater to get past you will add little time to your journey but can make a significant difference to stress levels\n\n\n        \tIf you find that you are being persistently followed by an aggressive driver – try to make your way to a public place, police station or busy street and if necessary call the police. Do not allow an aggressive driver to follow you home.\n\n\n        \tUnder no circumstances should you endanger your safety or wellbeing by getting out of the car to deal with an angry or aggressive driver. If confronted with a road rage situation remain in the car with the windows closed and door locked. If necessary, call for help on a mobile phone (not while driving).\n\n\n        \tIf you accidentally cause another driver to become angry – hold up your whole hand as a friendly acknowledgement of your mistake – this can diffuse the situation.\n\n\n        \tIf your mood is affected by an incident during your journey, once you have moved away from any danger, find an opportunity to stop and take time out.\n\n\n        \tFocus on the present and your driving rather than the destination or purpose of the journey.\n\n\n        \n\n        After Your Journey\n\n        \tIf you are able to recognise when you’re becoming stressed, angry or impatient while driving, you will be better equipped to deal with these emotions. Try to find time occasionally to reflect on your driving and think about how mood or stress has effected your actions.\n\n          \n\n\n        \n\n        \n        \nFeedback l Accessibility l Help l Copyright & Disclaimer l ©RoSPA 1998-2009\n\n\n    \t\n        RoSPA is a registered charity: Registered Charity No: 207823\n\n        Patron: Her Majesty the Queen\n        \n        RoSPA Head Office: Edgbaston Park, 353 Bristol Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B5 7ST, UK\n\n          Telephone: 0121 248 2000 Fax: 0121 248 2001 Email: help@rospa.com\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A miner who was conscripted into the pits as a Bevin Boy, he worked underground for thirty nine years. His paintings of mining life are often in bright and vivid colours. In this exhibition the Museum has combined an art exhibition curated by coal mining art authors Gillian Wales and Robert McManners with coal mining artefacts from the collections, chosen to show a little more of the reality of a miner’s life.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tan inphinet creationCopyright | Terms of Access | Privacy Policy\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\tHome\n\n\t\t\t| Visitor Zone\n\t\n\t\t\t| Museum and Library Zone\n\t\n\t\t\t| Learning Zone\n\t\n\t\t\t| Corporate Zone\n\t\n\t\t\t| About Us\n\t\n\t\t\t| Careers at the Museum\n\t\n\t\t\t| Support Us\n\t\n\t\t\t| Contact Us\n\t\n\t\t\t| Keep in Touch\n\t\n\t\t\t| What's On\n\t\n\t\t\t| Latest News\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFull Corporate Name:\nNational Coal Mining Museum for England Trust Ltd\n\n\t\t\t\tCompany Registration Number: 1702426\n\n\t\t\t\tCharity Registration Number: 517325\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRegistrar of Companies\nVAT Number: 457 5483 14 Data Controller: Dr Margaret Lindsay Faull\n\n\t\t\t\tSupervisory Authorities:\nEntrust, HM Inspectorate of Mines\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMLA: Museums, Libraries and Archives Council Regulatory Authorities:Charity Commission for England and Wales\n\n\t\t\t\t© 2008 National Coal Mining Museum for England.

There have been so many songs here in which they're the main subject of attention, and even though that attention is mostly good - warm memories of love, care and sound teaching - the two of them are downright sick of being sung about, whether in good ways or bad. It's their turn to sing about the kids, and it looks as if they're being brutally honest. Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn with 'You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly':\nC: You're the reason I'm a-ridin around on recapped tyres.\n\nL: And you're the reason I'm hangin our clothes outside on wires.\n\nC&L: And you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darlin.\n\nAh, but looks ain't everything,\n\nAnd money ain't everything.\n\nBut I love you just the same.\n\nC: You're the reason I've changed to beer from soda pop.\n\nL: And you're the reason I never get to go to the beauty shop.\n\nC&L: You're the reason our kids are ugly, little darlin.\n\nAh, but looks ain't everything,\n\nAnd money ain't everything.\n\nBut I love you just the same.\n\n\nI guess that we won't ever have everything we need.\n\nCause when we get ahead, it's got another mouth to feed.\n\n\nL: And that's the reason my good looks and my figure is gone.\n\nC: And that's the reason that I ain't got no hair to comb.\n\nC&L: And you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darlin.\n\nAh, but looks ain't everything,\n\nAnd money ain't everything.\n\nBut I love you just the same.\n\n\nL: Conway, why in the devil don't you go and shave and put on a clean pair of pants?\n\nC: Loretta, look at yourself. I wish you'd take them curlers out of your hair and go put on a little make-up. And get out of that housecoat before supper.\n\nL: Huh! Well let me tell you somethin, Conway. Considerin everything I went through today, I look like a movie star.\n\nC: Yeah, Ruth Buzzi.\n\nL: Thank you.\n\nC: Besides that, all of our kids took after your part of the family anyway.\n\nL: Oh they did, huh? What about the one that's bald?\n\nC: [Laughing] Well, I guess you might say they took after me.\n\nThose of you who find yourselves distressed by this song, feeling that it disrupts the ethos of the Momma 'n' Daddy series, please don't be. There's a tongue-in-cheek element to it. Mom and Dad here, I'm entirely confident, love their kids to bits and are only using their ugliness as a weapon of argument.\n\n[The Momma 'n' Daddy Archive, containing all the details of the series, is here.]\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Norm at 12:54 PM | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tMay 12, 2006\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDarfur after Abuja\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEric Reeves on the Abuja 'peace agreement' (free registration):\nIn essence, the victims of genocide are being asked to trust that the perpetrators of genocide will disarm and restrain themselves.\n(Via Jeff Weintraub - who reproduces the full text.) See also the CiF post by Catherine Jameson, and this interview with Jan Egeland, UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs:We can keep people alive but we cannot protect them. We are unarmed humanitarian workers; we can provide food, health care, water, sanitation. But we cannot keep people from being killed, or from being displaced for the second or the third or the fourth time. We are plaster on the wound. We need to heal the wound, but the wound can only be healed by massive political pressure and security action.\n\nBut I should also hasten to say that I think we are now on the wrong track. Everybody now discusses the optimal kind of U.N. mission - for next year, for nine months from now. This whole thing could unravel in nine days or nine weeks because we have no money to continue lifesaving humanitarian work.\n\nAnd 'Images' in the the panel on the right here.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Norm at 05:32 PM | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Hicks 1941-2006\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tI saw John Hicks, who has died at the age of 64, playing in the 'piano room' at the North Sea Jazz Festival three or four years back.\n\n\nListening now to John Hicks.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Norm at 04:13 PM | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWord for word\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBen Macintyre offers a list of literary euphemisms:\nEdgy Any author under the age of 30, being reviewed by someone over 30, is likely to be described as edgy.

The 1990s disintegrate into dangerous sexual liaisons between students and teachers and unpleasant confrontations with personal inadequacy, as in the case of Coetzee's David Lurie, Philip Roth's Coleman Silk and Franzen's Chip Lambert. It is, however, in the twenty-first century where Showalter is most homiletic. Indeed, what she has to say is far from jovial and is aptly expressed by her final chapter heading: 'Into the Twenty-First Century: Tragic Towers.'\n\nAt one point the reviewer is prompted by his subject matter to write:[T]he picture of academic life that emerges is far from happy. In fact, those privileged to attend university share a feeling of unhappiness... [W]e ponder why hardly any academics are happy where they are, no matter how apt the students, how generous the salary or perks, how beautiful the setting, how light the teaching load, how lavish the research budget. I don't know if it's academia itself that attracts misfits and malcontents or if the overwhelming hypocrisy of that world would have turned even the von Trapp family sullen.\nThat seems rather strong to me: the extent of the assumed unhappiness, 'misfits and malcontents', and 'overwhelming hypocrisy of that world'. Is there an overwhelming hypocrisy about it, greater than in other spheres of life? Are there more misfits and malcontents here than elsewhere? Yet it has often struck me that academics ought to be more contented than a lot of them seem to be. Much about the lives they - or, rather, we - lead is rewarding and indeed enviable, and the degree of dissatisfaction seems out of tune with this. But then again, I'm only gauging things from my own experience, and since all of my professional life has been as an academic, I'm not well placed to know whether the level of unhappiness in universities is particular to the milieu or merely the expression of a more general human tendency.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Norm at 02:23 PM | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntimations of utopia\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhenever it's sunny I feel outraged that we're not allowed to go outside and sit under a tree.\nJah Jah Dub dixit.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPosted by Norm at 12:34 PM | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe normblog profile 138: Jonathan Edelstein\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJonathan Edelstein is a 34-year-old lawyer who was born in Flushing NY and currently lives within five miles of his birthplace. In the course of his misspent life, he has been a freelance reporter, taught at a Hasidic day school, served as a United States Army reservist, pumped gas, stacked wood, driven a taxi and published 15 scholarly articles in law journals nobody reads. He is married to Naomi Rabinowitz and, although they anticipate children eventually, they've thus far stuck with cats. Jonathan blogs at The Head Heeb.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you blog? > In order to generate a community of mutual interest. (I say 'generate' rather than 'create' because it's the readers and commenters who really create it.) I have certain interests that aren't widely shared among my immediate circle - democratization and rule of law in developing countries, comparative diasporas and minorities, international law and legal history - and it's exciting to be able to discuss those things with an educated audience from around the world.\n\n\nWhat has been your best blogging experience? > The online Old Bailey Session Paper symposium that I hosted in February, which included some genuinely ground-breaking historical work. Who'd have guessed, for instance, that there was a Tahitian diaspora in London as early as 1827?\n\n\nWhat are your favourite blogs? > Lisa Goldman's On the Face, Marc Lynch's Abu Aardvark, and Crooked Timber. As you may gather, I don't live in an echo chamber.\n\n\nWho are your intellectual heroes? > Spinoza (with whose life I once took some liberties), Theodor Herzl and Emmanuel Levinas.\n\n\nWhat are you reading at the moment? > Islam and the Soviet Union by Yaacov Ro'i. \n\n\nWho are your cultural heroes? > Chinua Achebe, Bob Marley and Fela Kuti.\n\n\nWhat is the best novel you've ever read? > Chinua Achebe's No Longer at Ease.\n\n\nCan you name a major moral, political or intellectual issue on which you've ever changed your mind? > Hmmm, how many of them? Zionism, several times. International courts. Cloning. But the prize would have to go to affirmative action. I was once adamantly opposed to it on the ground that legislation can't change attitudes, but then I worked in an AA workplace and found that being around people of different backgrounds really does make a difference. Legislation may not change attitudes right away, but it can change behaviour, and behaviour eventually becomes habit.\n\n\nWhat philosophical thesis do you think it most important to disseminate? > The intrinsic worth of human beings.\n\n\nWhat philosophical thesis do you think it most important to combat? > The ideology of victimhood, which is seductive and easy to fall into but profoundly destructive to both the putative victims and their neighbours.\n\n\nCan you name a work of non-fiction which has had a major and lasting influence on how you think about the world? > Emmanuel Levinas's works on Zionism. Levinas's Talmudic foundations don't always resonate with a near-atheist like me, but his work opened my eyes to the possibility of a Zionism based on affirmation of values rather than purely ethnic nationalism or theology of possession. To a great extent, his conception of ethics rather than ethnicity as the fundamental basis of a Jewish state was what made it possible for me to be a Zionist.\n\n\nWho are your political heroes? > Yitzhak Rabin, Nelson Mandela and Chief Justice Aharon Barak. The former two should need no introduction; the latter's genius lies in his insistence upon and maintenance of the rule of law under very difficult circumstances.\n\n\nWhat is your favourite piece of political wisdom? > 'No political theory ever survives contact with reality.'\n\n\nIf you could effect one major policy change in the governing of your country, what would it be? > I'd like to see the United States adopt a modified form of the Israeli judicial selection system, with judges chosen by a panel composed of judicial, political and civil society representatives rather than being purely political appointees.\n\n\nIf you could choose anyone, from any walk of life, to be Prime Minister or President, who would you choose? > Well, you didn't say what country, so I'll nominate Nadia Hilou for prime minister of Israel. There could be nothing better for unifying Israeli society than to have an Arab prime minister who genuinely considers herself a citizen of the state and can guide majority and minority toward reconciliation.\n\n\nWhat would you do with the UN? > Make it responsible to a democratically elected body and give it some genuine dispute resolution authority.\n\n\nWhat do you consider to be the main threat to the future peace and security of the world? > Unwillingness to adapt ideology to reality.\n\n\nDo you think the world (human civilization) has already passed its best point, or is that yet to come? > If we don't destroy ourselves in the next half-century, the best is definitely yet to come. We're on the verge of overcoming many of the current constraints of scarcity, provided that we can survive long enough to implement them and then deal with the social stresses they cause. \n\n\nWhat would be your most important piece of advice about life? > Never leave yourself in a position where you can't change plans.\n\n\nWhat do you consider the most important personal quality? > Tolerance.\n\n\nWhat personal fault do you most dislike? > Pettiness.\n\n\nWhat is your favourite proverb? > 'Who is wise? He who learns from all.' (Ben Zoma, Pirkei Avot 4:1)\n\n\nWhat, if anything, do you worry about? > Insularity and demonization of the other.\n\n\nIf you were to relive your life to this point, is there anything you'd do differently? > I'd join the coast guard rather than the army. Over time, I've come to appreciate the idea of a service dedicated to saving lives - and, well, I've always wanted to do search and rescues.\n\n\nWhere would you most like to live (other than where you do)? > Montreal.\n\n\nWhat would your ideal holiday be? > I have a certain bias toward the one I made up: Arrival Day, a secular celebration of American Jews as an ethnic group rather than a religion.\n\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession? > Intellectual curiosity.\n\n\nWhat talent would you most like to have? > The ability to learn languages quickly.\n\n\nWhat would be your ideal choice of alternative profession or job? > I'd like some day to go back to journalism, preferably on a topic relating to international law.\n\n\nIf you could have one (more or less realistic) wish come true, what would you wish for? > Does a return to Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations count as more or less realistic? Barring that, I'd like to see Hamas and the Israeli rabbinate take a few more steps down the path that Rabbi Ovadia Yosef began in the 1990s and recognize peace and preservation of human life as higher theological imperatives than possession.\n\n\n\n\n[The normblog profile is a weekly Friday morning feature.

          "Jubilee Debt Campaign UK : Drop the debt! : Drop the debt!\n\n\n\nDrop the debt!\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpayable and unjust poor country debt must be cancelled fully, quickly and without conditions, through a fair and open process, if we are to see a permanent end to the scandal of debt repayments killing people in poor countries.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\tFull cancellation: there must be irreversible 100% cancellation of unpayable and unjust debts. 'Unpayable' debts are those that a country cannot afford to pay whilst meeting its own people's basic needs. 'Unjust' debts are those that are not legitimate claims, such as 'odious' debts on loans knowingly given to dictators, or those from loans given on unfair terms, or for failed projects based on lenders' advice.\n\tCancellation now: cancellation needs to happen quickly. The current situation is an injustice and a crisis, whilst the benefits of debt cancellation are well-established.\n\tAn end to harmful conditions: international institutions such as the World Bank and IMF must stop attaching harmful strings to debt relief. Poor countries should no longer have to privatise basic services or cut public spending as a condition for receiving desperately needed debt relief.\n\tNew money: the rich world must fund this cancellation not by using money already pledged as aid, but by digging into their pockets and providing new money. \n\tA fair, open process: in the long term, we need a transparent, impartial and comprehensive international insolvency process to resolve debt crises, to judge what debt is unpayable or unjust, and to ensure that human needs take priority over debt repayments.\n\tGrants not loans: to avoid another debt crisis like the current one, poor countries should be given more grants, rather than have their debt burden piled higher with yet more loans.\n\tTransparency and accountability: creditors and debtors must be fully transparent about the extent of debts, the terms of any debt relief, and the amounts and terms of new loans - this is the only way that the parliaments, media and citizens of poor countries can hold their governments accountable. At the moment, too much is negotiated behind closed doors, with governments being accountable to other, rich, governments or institutions like the World Bank and IMF, rather than their own people.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battle plans for the war on poverty are drawn and certified correct.

Make two or three slashes in the skin on each side of the fish, then grill for 15-20 minutes, depending on size, turning once, until tender. \n\nPurée the gooseberries and sieve to remove the pips. Pour the purée into a clean pan, beat in the egg, then reheat gently, stirring. Place the mackerel on warmed serving plates and spoon the sauce beside the fish.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nTop of pagePrevious page\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n© The British Food Trust\n\nWebsite built and maintained by Ennovation Solutions Ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n",

This causes a \"swaying\" motion.\nHowever, if it is forced to close it will prove a real headache for the club ? its season-opener is already a 45,000 seat sell-out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    Source URL: http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/138993/soccer-club-stand-safety-worry-after-wobble\n\n    \n\n  ",

          "DRAFTNATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES  \n \nREPORT FROM THE FINANCE COMMITTEE  \n \n \nOperation of the Budget Process \n \nSummary \n \n 1. Standing Order 14.2 permits the Finance Committee to “consider and, where it \nsees fit, report on:  \n  \n (i) financial information in explanatory memoranda accompanying proposed  \nAssembly Measures; \n   \n (ii) the timetable for the consideration of budget proposals and budget motions \nand on the handling of financial business; and  \n  \n (iii) any other matter relating to or affecting the expenditure of the government or \nother expenditure out of the Welsh Consolidated Fund.” \n  \n \n2. The Assembly recently approved the annual budget motion which authorised \nthe use of resources for Ministers and others for 2008-09. This was the \nculmination of a process which started soon after the Summer Recess with the \npublication of draft budgets for the Assembly Commission, Auditor General and \nPublic Services Ombudsman. The Finance Minister published the draft budget \nfor the Government on 5 November 2007 and this was examined in detail by the \nFinance Committee during that month. The Finance Committee’s detailed report \nwas tabled on 3 December and this was followed by a plenary debate on the \ndraft budget on 11 December. The final budget motion was laid on 15 January \n2008 and was approved in plenary on 22 January. \n \n3. This report takes an initial look at how the budget process as designed under \nPart 5 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 and Standing Order 27 has \noperated in practice and makes a number of recommendations for improvement \nwhich the Finance Committee hopes will be helpful to the Assembly and the \nGovernment. \n \n4. The Finance Committee and the Finance Minister have agreed to develop a \nprotocol on the handling of business. This would cover matters that were too \ndetailed or otherwise not appropriate for inclusion in the Standing Orders. The \nagreement to establish such a protocol provides an opportunity to consider \nwhether the Standing Orders should be amended in the light of recent \nexperience with a view to ensuring that, together, they provide a framework that \nis appropriate and acceptable to all concerned. \n \nThe budget scrutiny process was a considerable improvement on that undertaken \nin previous years despite the timing constraints \n 5. The budget process in the 1999-2003 and 2003-2007 Assemblies was \ndesigned to enable plenary to “adopt” the budgets proposed by the Finance \nMinister for what was then a corporate body. There was no Finance Committee \nand the process took the form of subject committees giving views on spending \npriorities plus plenary debates on the draft and final budgets. \n \n6. The 2006 Act has changed the process from one of budget “adoption” to one \nin which Ministers request the Assembly’s ”authority for the use of resources”. \nThis authorisation process takes the form of a budget motion of the Assembly, \nwhich is introduced by Ministers. The requirement on the Assembly to consider \nrequests for resources made by Ministers gives added emphasis to the need for \nadequate scrutiny of budget proposals before the formal budget motion is \nconsidered in plenary. The establishment of the Finance Committee to scrutinise \nbudgets is thus an important development in assisting the Assembly with its \nimportant function of considering and authorising resources. \n \n7.  The Finance Committee took detailed evidence from the Finance Minister on \ntwo occasions and also from representatives of local government and NHS \nWales during the scrutiny of the Government’s draft budget. Other scrutiny \ncommittees considered the detail of department elements of that budget and took \nevidence from various Ministers. The Finance Committee also took further \nevidence from the Finance Minister after the final budget was published. In \naddition the Finance Committee also took evidence from the Assembly \nCommission and the Public Services Ombudsman on their respective budgets. \n \n8. All those giving evidence to the Finance Committee welcomed the opportunity \nto explain their budgets or give their points of view. The Finance Minister, in \nopening the plenary debate on the Government’s draft budget, welcomed the \nFinance Committee’s report and recognised its crucial role in the scrutiny \nprocess.  \n \n9. Without doubt, therefore, the new framework under the 2006 Act and the new \nStanding Orders has resulted in a considerable improvement to the scrutiny \nprocess compared with previous years. However, the process was complicated \nand constrained by the fact that the Treasury undertook a Comprehensive \nSpending Review during 2007 which was late in reporting. The Assembly \namended the Standing Orders to accommodate the unavoidable delay in the \npublication of the Government’s draft budget and ensured that the planned \nwindow for scrutiny was not shortened. Despite this, it soon became apparent \nthat the time prescribed by the Standing Orders was tight and the laid down \nprocedure was somewhat inflexible. In a year where the budget had to follow a \nspending review as well as an election and the establishment of a coalition \ngovernment with new spending priorities, this shortage of time was particularly \nacute. \n \nThe scrutiny of the Government’s draft budget would be aided by a written \nexplanation of its main features and a better linking of the spending plans to \npolicy objectives \n \n10. The Government’s draft budget took the form of a draft budget motion for \n2008-09 which was extended to provide indicative figures for 2009-10 and 2010-11. In essence this document showed the total resources required to be \nauthorised for each Ministerial portfolio (plus central services and some “Match \nFunding”) and resource to cash and other reconciliations required by the \nStanding Orders.  \n \n11. The draft budget document was supplemented by a breakdown of the budget \nfor each Main Expenditure Group (MEG). The MEG totals differed from the \namounts to be authorised for each portfolio as the former included items that are \nnot part the Government’s accounts and do not therefore form part of the \nresources to be authorised for use by Ministers (e.g. local authority supported \nborrowing and capital charges for NHS and other public bodies). It was therefore \ndifficult to relate one document to another. \n \n12. The budget documents contained very little by way of written explanation of \nhow the amounts allocated to each portfolio and the amounts to be held in the \ncontingency reserve had been derived. Furthermore it was not possible to clearly \nlink the Government’s spending plans to its policy objectives. \n \n13. The Finance Committee considers that the draft of the formal budget motion \nneeds to be supplemented by: \n \n• An explanation of the resources being made available by the Treasury in \nspending review years and any in-year changes in non-spending review \nyears including any proposed used of resources accrued under the \nTreasury’s End of Year Flexibility regime; \n• A commentary on the Finance Minister’s resource allocation to portfolios \nand contingency reserve; \n• A commentary and appropriate breakdown on the spending plans for \neach portfolio; and \n• A clear link between the spending plans and the Government’s policy \nobjectives. \n \n14. In respect of the latter, the Financial Reporting Manual requires the \nGovernment’s annual accounts to show the resources used for each objective \nand it would be appropriate for the budget information to be produced on a \ncomparable basis. However, a necessary prerequisite would be to produce \nmeaningful objectives to which resources can be attributed.  \n \nTime available for overall scrutiny of the Government’s draft budget \n \n15. Standing Order 27.4 requires the Finance Committee to report on the \nGovernment’s budget within four weeks of it being tabled. Other scrutiny \ncommittees may consider the budget and make recommendations to the Finance \nCommittee within two weeks of it being tabled. \n \n16. In order to comply with the Standing Orders, the Finance Committee \nincreased the usual frequency of its meetings from fortnightly to weekly for the \nfour weeks after the Government’s draft budget was tabled on 5 November 2007. \nThese meetings were used to take evidence from the Finance Minister (twice) \nand from representatives of local government and NHS Wales, and to consider submissions from other committees and the Finance Committee’s own report. \nThe complexity of the budget and the evidence received resulted in the Finance \nCommittee having a further meeting to agree the report.  \n \n17. Standing Order 27.1 provides that the Government’s draft budget must be \ntabled by 7 October but the Finance Committee’s four week deadline starts from \nthe date the draft budget is tabled. Owing to the delay in publishing the outcome \nof the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, the 7 October deadline was \nextended to 5 November on a one-off basis. The uncertainty of the date on which \nthe draft budget would be published added to the difficulty in scheduling \nmeetings and calling witnesses – not just for the Finance Committee but also for \nthe other scrutiny committees. \n \n18. The Finance Committee understands the difficulties caused by the late \nreporting of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review. Notwithstanding these \nparticular difficulties, the Committee would like to explore with the Finance \nMinister the possibility of introducing a separate stage in the budget process in \nSpending Review Years to enable scrutiny of the settlement and the Welsh \nGovernment’s spending priorities for the Review period.  \n \n19. The Finance Committee also recommends that, for non-spending review \nyears, the Standing Orders should provide for the Committee to report by a fixed \ndate and for the Government to table the draft budget by four weeks before that \ndate. This would enable the Committee to plan and schedule its meetings \n(including possible requests to the Business Committee for additional meetings) \nat an earlier stage (and give better notice to witnesses) than would be the case \nwith a start time that depended on when the Government tabled its draft budget.  \nAlternatively, Standing Orders could provide for the Government to make an \nearly announcement of the date on which it will table the draft budget (e.g. by the \nend of May).  \n \nOther scrutiny committees have a critical role to play in the scrutiny of \ndepartmental finances but this should not be an annual event  \n \n20. The time available for scrutiny was also an issue for other committees. \nStanding Orders currently require them to provide their views to the Finance \nCommittee within two weeks of the draft budget being laid. Most of the other \ncommittees commented that the two-week window available for their scrutiny of \nportfolio budgets was inadequate. As with the Finance Committee, the delayed \nComprehensive Spending Review and uncertain start date made it difficult to \nschedule meetings and call witnesses (mainly the appropriate Minister). \n \n21. The Finance Committee considers that an additional stage to the budget \nprocess in Spending Review Years (see paragraph 18 above) together with a \ndate for the tabling of the draft budget that was known well in advance (see \nparagraph 19 above) would go some way towards addressing their concerns.  \n \n22. The Finance Committee also considers that financial scrutiny should be an \nongoing process and not an annual event. The other scrutiny committees have a \nvital role to play in giving their views on spending priorities, examining the \ndetailed budgets for individual portfolios and also looking at how resources are used during the year. Ideally this would involve quarterly in-year monitoring of \nhow Ministers and officials have used the allocated resources to meet policy \nobjectives and discharge their statutory functions. This in turn should help \nprovide information for considering spending priorities for future years. The \nFinance Committee would welcome comments on budgetary matters from other \nscrutiny committees at anytime during the year. \n \nThe protocol could usefully include arrangements for the giving of evidence and \nthe production of information by the Finance Minister \n \n23. The Finance Minister gave evidence to the Finance Committee twice during \nits consideration of the draft budget and again after the final budget was \npublished. Members acknowledge that this was a considerable time commitment \non the part of the Minister. For the future, the Finance Committee considers that \nthe protocol should include suitable arrangements for the taking of evidence from \nthe Finance Minister but with suitable flexibility to enable variations from the norm \nif the need arises. \n \n24. After the first evidence session, the Minister agreed to provide the Finance \nCommittee with supplementary information in answer to questions raised. Not all \nof the information was provided in sufficient time to be of use in subsequent \nsessions. The Finance Committee is not seeking to criticise or attribute any \nblame for this – particularly in what was a difficult year – but considers that a \ntimescale for provision of agreed written information could be governed by the \nprotocol. \n \nStanding Order 27 is not fully in line with the rationale underlying Section 125 of \nthe 2006 Act  \n \n25. Section 125 of the 2006 Act provides the high level framework for the annual \nbudget approval process. As is the case in most parliamentary democracies, \nresponsibility for preparing the budget rests with Government and it is for the \nAssembly to give statutory approval to the use of resources. This is done by way \nof a budget motion introduced into the Assembly by Ministers. This arrangement \nreflects the fact that government functions (powers and duties) are now conferred \ndirectly on Ministers. It is for Ministers to decide on the level of resources needed \nto exercise those functions and to seek authorisation from the Assembly to use \nthose resources.  \n \n26. Section 125(a) specifies that the annual budget motion has the effect of \nauthorising the amount of resources for the services and purposes specified in \nthe motion. In effect, the motion sets a “ceiling” or upper limit on the amount of \nresources that can be used for each service or purpose specified in the motion. \nAny expenditure incurred that is in excess of those ceilings would be irregular. \n \n27. The Act does not define the “services or purposes” to be specified in the \nbudget motion. That is a matter for the Government to decide having regard to \nhow it wishes to present its budget and account for its spending. In practice, \nservices and purposes have been defined by specifying detailed “ambits” that \ncover each Ministerial portfolio plus additional ambits for “central administration”, \n“other Ministerial services” and “match funding”.  Therefore, the Assembly is being asked to authorise a ceiling on the use of resources for each portfolio. Any \nin-year changes to these portfolio ceilings would need to be authorised by a \nsupplementary budget motion whilst changes within portfolios is a matter for \ninternal Government procedures. The Finance Committee accepts this approach \non the assumption that the ambits will be amended as necessary each time there \nis a change to Ministerial portfolios. \n \n28. The concept of the budget motion setting “ceilings” requested by the \nGovernment for each portfolio is important to the understanding of the process.  \nEven if it were possible for the Assembly to increase the amounts requested \n(which it is not) it would be of little consequence because there is no mechanism \nby which the Assembly is able to direct Ministers to spend the additional amount. \nIn the post May 2007 world the Assembly cannot instruct the Government in this \nway – only hold it to account. \n \n29. Standing Orders 27.17 to 27.20 make further provision concerning the annual \nbudget motion. In particular SO 27.20 reflects the rationale set out above by \nprohibiting the tabling of any amendments. The Finance Committee accepts this \nprovision and would also argue that, given its importance, an outright rejection of \nthe budget motion by the Assembly would be tantamount to a vote of no \nconfidence. \n \n30. Standing Order 27.1 to 27.6 provide for the consideration of the \nGovernment’s draft budget. In particular, SO 27.5 provides that the Finance \nCommittee may recommend changes to the budget provided that the net effect \nwould not increase or decrease the aggregate amount of resources or cash \nproposed by the Government. It seems this provision was intended to give some \ncredence to the rationale set out above whilst also allowing some greater \nflexibility to suggest amendments at this earlier stage in the process. The \nPresiding Officer, in ruling on a point of order, took the view that paragraph 35 of \nthe Finance Committee’s report of 3 December 2007 on the Government’s draft \nbudget breached SO 27.5. This was because it recommended that the Finance \nMinster reconsidered the Government’s stance on disabled children’s services \nwith a view to making at least £21 million available over the next three years \nwithout proposing any offsetting savings form other budget headings.  \n \n31. After careful consideration, the Finance Committee considers that SO 27.5 \ndoes not adequately reflect the rationale for the budget process as set out above. \nFirst, resource ceilings are authorised by the Assembly at portfolio level and \ntherefore any restrictions on proposing changes to the draft budgets should be \nspecified at that level. Allocations within individual portfolios are a matter for \nMinisters, they do not fall to be authorised by the Assembly and, in the view of \nthe Finance Committee, need not be regulated by Standing Orders.  \n \n32. More importantly, the Finance Committee considers that it should be able to \ndraw the Assembly's attention to any reasonable concerns that it wishes to make. \nThese will include concerns as to whether enough resource is being made \navailable to provide core services and to meet the Government’s strategic \nobjectives and spending pledges. However, the Finance Committee also takes \nthe view that, realistically, it would not be possible to propose changes to a draft \nbudget (at portfolio level) if it was required to specify which portfolios should be reduced and by how much if others are increased. Only the Government has the \nwherewithal or inside knowledge to do so. The proper process should be for the \nCommittee and the Assembly more widely to express its views, and for the \nGovernment to explain how it has addressed those views when it presents its \nfinal budget. \n \n33. Taking account of the above considerations, and to prevent future confusion, \nthe Finance Committee suggests that the simplest solution would be for SO 27.5 \nto be deleted. If this is accepted the Committee would be agreeable to including \na provision within the protocol so that its reports on the Government’s draft \nbudgets would not propose specific monetary amendments at portfolio level.  \n \nConsideration should be given to having a draft budget debate in plenary on an \nunamendable motion to take note of the Finance Committee’s report \n \n34. The first plenary debate on the Government's budget is governed by \nStanding Order 27.6. The debate takes place on a motion tabled by \nMinisters to \"take note of the draft budget for the Government\". In effect, \nthis debate is a forerunner to the debate on the final budget motion and \nthe outcome is, in any event, not binding on Ministers.    The Finance \nCommittee considers that it might enhance the Assembly’s scrutiny and “holding \nto account” if the Minister were to make a statement in plenary at the time the \ndraft budget is laid, and for the later debate to be based on a motion to take note \nof the Committee’s report on the draft budget.  \n \nThe protocol should provide for information to be given to the Finance Committee \non in-year reallocations of resources within departments, outturn against budgets \nand proposals to enter into significant contingent liabilities \n \n35. As stated above (paragraph 27), the Assembly authorises resources at \nportfolio level. Budget changes within portfolios are a matter for the \nGovernment’s internal procedures. However, in order to enhance transparency \nand accountability, it would be appropriate for the Finance Minister to inform the \nAssembly of movements within departmental budgets to the extent that they \naffect the detail given in the documents supporting the original budget. As a \nminimum this should be done each time the Government tables a supplementary \nbudget motion or every three months if sooner. The Finance Committee \nrecommends that provision for this should be included in the protocol. \n \n36. The Finance Minister has agreed to provide the Finance Committee with \nperiodic statements of outturn against budget. The arrangements for this could \nalso be included in the protocol. \n \n37. The 2006 Act effectively transferred the function of entering into contingent \nliabilities (e.g. giving indemnities or guarantees) from the Assembly to Ministers. \nProvisions relating to these are therefore no longer in the Standing Orders. \nHowever, it would be appropriate for the Assembly to have some oversight and \nscrutiny of any such significant (e.g. in excess of £1 million) contingent liabilities \nbefore they are finalised. This is because they have the effect of binding the \nAssembly into authorising the resources in the event of indemnities maturing or guarantees being called. The Finance Committee considers that provision for this \nshould also be included in the protocol. \n \nThe arrangements for considering the budgets of the Assembly Commission, \nAuditor General and Ombudsman are acceptable given the current legislative \nframework \n \n38. Standing Order 27.8 provides for the Finance Committee’s consideration of \nthe draft budget of the Assembly Commission. The issues considered above in \nrespect of the Finance Committee’s consideration of the Government’s draft \nbudget on flexibility (paragraph 19) and the ability to propose changes to the draft \nbudget (paragraphs 30 to 32) apply also to its consideration of the Commission’s \nbudget. \n \n39. Standing Orders 27.9 to 27.12 provide for the approval of the Commission’s \nbudget by the Assembly. Under Standing Order 27.17, the Government must \nthen incorporate that approved budget within the annual budget motion which it \ntables under Section 125 of the 2006 Act. These provisions were designed to \nrespect the Commonwealth Principles on the three Branches of Government (the \nLatimer House Principles) – specifically that the “parliament’s budget should not \nbe capable of amendment by the executive”. The Finance Committee is content \nwith these provisions. \n \n40. The Finance Committee is also content with the provisions for the \nconsideration of the budgets of the Auditor General and Ombudsman who, like \nthe Commission, are independent of Government. \n \n41. The Finance Committee notes that further independent offices are likely to be \ncreated in the near future.  Legislation is currently being drafted to put the office \nof Standards Commissioner for Wales on a statutory basis and the Government \nhas indicated that it wishes to replace the Welsh Language Board with a Welsh \nLanguage Commissioner. As is currently the case with the Auditor General and \nthe Ombudsman, these new offices are likely to be established as “corporation \nsoles” with no governing board. \n \n42. Whilst the Finance Committee is able to examine the budgets of these office \nholders (excluding the Auditor General whose budget is a matter for the Audit \nCommittee under the 2006 Act), no formal mechanism exists for appointing the \noffice holders and for examining their corporate plans and governance \narrangements. The Finance Committee considers that there may be an \nincreasing need for greater accountability of such officers in future particularly in \nthe light of the recent review of the governance arrangements for the National \n1\nAudit OfficeTP F FPT. One such model (but there are others) is the New Zealand \n“Officers of Parliament Committee” which performs such a role for the officers \n2\nthat are independent of governmentTP F FPT. Any revised arrangements would need to \n                                            \n1 th\nTP PT Review of the National Audit Office's Corporate Governance HC 328 14P P Report of the Public \nAccounts Commission \n \n2\nTP PT Currently these consist of the Controller and Auditor General, Ombudsman and Environment \nCommissioner. respect the operational independence of the officers and, in the case of the \nAuditor General, the statutory relationship with the Audit Committee. \n \nRecommendations \n \n43. The Finance Committee considers that the proposed protocol should include, \namongst other things: \n \n (i) A list of the minimum documentation that the Government will \nprovide in support of the draft budget motion (paragraph 13 and 14); \n \n (ii) Arrangements for the taking of evidence from the Finance Minister \non the budget (paragraphs 23 and 24);  \n \n (iii) Provision of information in-year reallocations of resources within \ndepartments, outturn against budgets and proposals to enter into significant \ncontingent liabilities (paragraphs 36 to 38); and \n \n(iv) An additional stage to the budget process in Spending Review \nYears (paragraph 18). \n \n44. The Finance Committee recommends that consideration be given to \namending the Standing Orders as follows: \n \n (i) SOs 27.1 and 27.8 to provide for the Finance Committee to report \nby a fixed date rather than an elapsed time following the tabling of draft budgets. \nAlternatively, the Government should be committed to announcing the date on \nwhich it will table the budget by the end of May (paragraphs 19 and 39); \n \n (ii) SOs 27.5, 27.24 and the final sentence of SO 27.8 to be deleted \n(paragraphs 30 to 33 and 39); and \n \n (iv) SO 27.6 to be amended so that the plenary debate is based on a \nmotion in respect of the Finance Committee’s report on the draft budget \n(paragraphs 34). \n \n45. The Finance Committee encourages other scrutiny committees to look at the \nuse of resources by the spending departments within their purview regularly \nthroughout the year and not just as a one-off annual event. The Finance \nCommittee would welcome comments on budgetary matters from other scrutiny \ncommittees at anytime during the year (paragraph 22). \n \n46. Longer term, the Assembly may wish to give further consideration to the \narrangements for the appointment, oversight and governance arrangements for \ncorporations’ sole that are independent of Government, particularly if forthcoming \nlegislation increases the number of such offices (paragraph 43). \n",

I have to get to the bottom of the much demonised Common Fisheries Policy - and so this week took me to Brussels to talk about fish. \n\n    I was asked by Struan Stevenson, our fisheries spokesman in the European Parliament, to join him for lunch with the Fisheries Commissioner, Joe Borg. Also at lunch was the star of the BBC series \"Trawlermen\", Jimmy Buchan. As well as being the much loved skipper of the Amity II which fishes the stormy waters of the North Sea from Peterhead, Jimmy is also our candidate for the local seat of Banff and Buchan. \n\n    The Commissioner was good company and open about his plans to reform the CFP. Having an hour and a half with someone as influential to the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen was an opportunity not to be missed. We discussed the future of quotas and the impact the reduction in days at sea was having on fishing communities. \n\n    We also tackled the thorny issue of discards. The staggering statistic that over half the fish caught by UK fisherman are never landed but are thrown back dead, makes this one of my top priorities. I was pleased to learn that our plans to end discards do not fall foul of European rules.\n\n    I was also pleased that we are at last getting somewhere with the daft proposal to include the \"recreational catch\" in national quotas. This idea has outraged Britain's 1.1 million sea anglers. The Commissioner has rowed back on this measure so that fewer anglers will be affected but more needs to be done. To me it is simple; if you catch a few fish for the pot you are indulging in a recreation. A hobby, if you like. If you sell the fish you catch you are a commercial fisherman.??\n\n    The idea that a few friends going out to fish over a wreck for a day have to be registered, pay a fee and report all they land is absurd. I pointed out to the Commissioner that for many seaside resorts sea angling was the only tourist activity for the winter months. I am really hopeful that we can finally see off a measure that would have put many small boat owners and hoteliers out of business.\n\n    Jimmy and I also attended a meeting of the EU Fisheries Committee and saw Struan succeed in getting an amendment passed that would allow national Governments to take decisions regarding the recreational catch.\n\n    It is noticeable that for all their blather UKIP are next to useless in standing up for British interests. Despite much talk they had not submitted one amendment on this measure. \n\n    I have been to the European Parliament a few times and I am always struck by the stupidity of having the Parliament in two places. In order to appease the French, plenary sessions of the Parliament are held in Strasbourg. This means that every few weeks the whole vast Euro-caravan packs up its offices and makes for its other home. There cannot be a more wasteful exercise on this earth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t( 0 comments )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tComment on this blog\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGo to The Blue Blog\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPrint\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSend to a friend\n\tDel.icio.us\n\tDigg\n\tStumbleUpon\n\tFacebook\n\treddit\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tComment\n \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou must Login or Register to add a comment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\nTop 20 blog roll\n\tBoulton and Co\n\tBuzzMachine\n\tCoffee House\n\tComment Central\n\tComment is Free\n\tConservativeHome\n\tDizzy Thinks\n\tGuido Fawkes\n\tIain Dale's Diary\n\tMumsnet\n\tNick Robinson\n\tOpen House\n\tPinkNews\n\tPolitical Betting\n\tPoliticsHome\n\tRed Box\n\tThe Register\n\tTechCrunch\n\ttechPresident\n\tThree Line Whip\n\n\n\t\t\t\tView all blogs\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tContact us\n\tLogin\n\tPress Releases\n\tTerms of use\n\tSite map\n\tAccessibility\n\tPrivacy\n\tRSS feeds\n\tPodcasts\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPromoted by Alan Mabbutt on behalf of the Conservative Party, both at 30 Millbank, London, SW1P 4DP\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

and for connected purposes. \nThis Measure, passed by the National Assembly for Wales on [ ] and approved by Her \nMajesty in Council on [ ], enacts the following provisions:- \nMPM-02-S1  3-1-08 Proposed Healthy Eating in Schools (Wales) Measure  2 \nT1T TDuties in relation to the promotion of healthy eating in schoolsT  \n(1) Every authority referred to in subsection (2) must exercise its functions so as to \npromote healthy eating by registered pupils of schools maintained by local education \nauthorities in Wales whilst those pupils are at school or whilst they are engaging in \n5 any activity which is incidental to their education and which is organised by or on \nbehalf of the head teacher of that school or by the local education authority.  \n(2) The authorities referred to in subsection (1) are��� \n(a) the Welsh Ministers;

An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, ?Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.?\n\nSuddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,\n\n?Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favour rests.?\n\nWhen the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ?Let?s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.?\n\nSo they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.\n\nBut Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.\n\nThe shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.\n\nLuke 2:8-20\n\n\n\n\nBack to the top\n\nBookmark this page: \n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch rejesus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\nAbout this module\n\nWhat is the original story behind Christmas?

We would like to plant 200,000 trees to create a large tract of new woodland that will reconnect the few surviving fragments of ancient woods, providing a valuable haven for species such as the bullfinch and water vole.\n\nA fantastic location for woodland creation, the planting design will include shrubby edges full of low growing, nectar rich flowers for insects, which will be left to set seed to allow buntings and finches to forage. Water voles will been encouraged to use the stream edges.\n\nUrgent appeal\n\nTogether, these three acquisitions are an unmissable opportunity to plant up to a million trees, a transformation which will safeguard almost 1,500 acres for wildlife and future generations. \n\nWith land in England becoming increasingly difficult to acquire, we must act now. We have a total project cost of Â£12 million for these three projects and we desperately need your support. This urgent appeal is a major step towards making our vision for woodland creation in England become reality.\nPlease give generously. \n\n\nFind out more about woodland creation.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t        \n\n\n\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n    \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\n\t\t\t\t\t            \n\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t\t\t       \t\t\n\t\t\t\t        \n\n\t\t\t\t        \n\t\n\t\t\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n                \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t        \n\t\n\n\t\t        \n                \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n\n\n\n\t\t                    \n\t\n\t    \n\t\t    \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t        \n\n\t              \n\n\t           \n\n\t        \n\n          \t\n          \t\t\n          \t\t\t\n          \t\t\t\tThe Woodland Trust is the UK's leading woodland conservation charity.\n          \t\t\t\n\n          \t\t\t\n          \t\t\t\tThe Woodland Trust is a charity registered in England and Wales (No. 294344) and in Scotland (No. SC038885).\nA non-profit making company limited by guarantee.

In the event, there wasn’t quite as much sociology as I expected, but the discussion provided lots of insights into varied practices regarding the management and sharing of data, and the cultural factors that  underpin this. \n\n   \n\n  In this vein, the meeting explored the relationship between research culture and technology. It was attended by about 25 participants from various perspectives:\nbiomedical researchers (biologists, geneticists and proteomicists especially), sociologists, bioinformaticians, research funders… There were presentations highlighting data sharing practices in genetics and proteomics, citing examples from the RNAi Global Consortium and the European Bioinformatics Institute. I was particularly interested in a talk from Sabina Leonelli, from the London School of Economics, who pointed to the tensions that make the effective sharing of data so challenging; for instance, behavioural tensions between protectionism and the need to share resources with regard to dissemination, and the different sorts of tensions between the stability of classiﬁcation categories and the dynamism/diversity of research practices.\n \n  It was also keen to take part in the session that covered the issue of rewards and incentives for researchers who create and disseminate data (a key issue, incidentally, in the RIN’s recent report on publication and quality assurance of research data outputs). There was an understandable consensus that data are an important research output in their own right, but that conventional methods of reward and recognition do not properly address data creation. There was less agreement, however, about the best means of incentivising researchers: carrot or stick? One way or the other, the role of research funders is crucial.\n \n  The workshop reﬂected a signiﬁcant level of activity in this area. In addition to our own aforementioned report, there is - to name but a few initiatives - the nearly-completed, JISC-commissioned study on the skills, role and career structure of data scientists and curators, the recent JISC report on the costs to HEIs of data preservation, the work of the new Research Data Management Forum, and more localised initiatives such as another workshop that I took part in recently at the University of Oxford on research data management. Lots going on then, so it’s important to ensure that there is a degree of co-ordination between such valuable activities.\n\n   \n    \n\n    \n        \n\t    \n  \n\t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \t            \n\t               \n\n\t\t          \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\n  In this section\n\n\n  \tTeam Blog\n\tGuest Blogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Related to this\n\n\n  \tOpen science case studies\n\tBenefits of research data centres\n\tTo share or not to share: research data outputs\n\tStewardship of digital research data – principles and guidelines\n\tTo share or not to share: Publishing research data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Feeds\n\n\n  \tRIN Feed\n\tBlog Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n            \t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tShare this\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t     \n\n\t\t\t      \n\n\t\t        \n\n                            \n\n                      \n  \n                     \n                 \n          \n\n        \n        \n\n                \n        \n      \n\n      \n\t\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n          \n      \n        \n        \n\n  Our Tweets\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n      \n      \n    \t  \n  \n                Google publishes Stanford dissertations online http://tiny.cc/VuYVK\n  \n  \n  \n                12 hours 48 min ago\n  \n\n\t  \n  \n                Is an e-book a book? http://tiny.cc/XbG43\n  \n  \n  \n                12 hours 51 min ago\n  \n\n\t  \n  \n                Efficiency and quality of research is being damaged by lack of access, says new RIN report http://tiny.cc/o1ddp\n  \n  \n  \n                3 days 8 hours ago\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  RIN Networks\n\n\n  \tOur Facebook group\n\tFollow us on Twitter\n\tView our Delicioius links\n\tSee our events on Upcoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  RIN in your inbox\n\n\n  You are subscribed to our newsletter.

Please try to avoid the temptation of assuming that the ranges are not being used until at least mid-afternoon.\n\n\n\nOn days when climbers have priority, the shooters can use the sites if climbers are not present when they arrive. However, if climbers arrive, shooting must cease. Please allow them a reasonable time to clear up.\n\n\n\nIf, the shooters are using Wilton 2, but are not in Wilton 3, climbers can still use Wilton 3, provided that they do not climb the routes on Orange Wall (i.e. routes between Twin Cracks and Orange Corner inclusive). Climbers must then not pass the fence on the ridge between Wilton 2 and 3 or descend past it.\n\n\n\nThe normal access routes into the quarries are as follows:\n\n\n\nWilton 2 & 4: Enter via a stile at the left side of Wilton 4 when facing the quarry. The stile is located above the bend on Scout Road - opposite the PRoW along the top of Wilton 1. \n\nFor Wilton 2, walk to the obvious ridge separating Wilton 2 & Wilton 4, and then descend steps into the quarry. This approach must not be used to reach Wilton 3 on shooting days.\n\n\n\nWilton 3: A diagonal track leads into the quarry from Scout Rd. (approx. 30m below the entrance to Wilton 2).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tOn Open Access land.\n\nSee map here; http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk/things_to_do/open_access/open_access_maps\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLast updated:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12/10/2009\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n                \n\n            \n            \n                \n                    The BMC (British Mountaineering Council) is the representative body that exists \n                    to protect the freedoms and promote the interests of climbers, hill walkers and \n                    mountaineers, including ski-mountaineers.

The Trust Board has fully supported this approach and empowered a working group to deliver on key policy objectives. A range of important initiatives have been developed within this over-arching strategy that have included: -\n\n\tThe implementation of a number of utility saving and waste management projects has enabled the Trust to reduce its carbon footprint and save, on a recurring basis;  \n\tInvolvement on the second phase of the Carbon’s Trust Carbon Management programme to develop a Implementation Plan that will provide a structured 5-year plan to reduce our carbon footprint; \n\n\nShould you wish to discuss our progress further, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nRegards\nMark Lewis\nDeputy Head of Estates\n\nCarmarthenshire NHS Trust\nUpdate Report on Utilities, Waste and Environmental Management\n\nBackground\n\nThis document sets out a brief overview of the Trust’s activities in achieving improvements to a range of sustainable issues including energy, waste and environmental management within the organisation.  The Trust is progressing well with a range of initiatives which are already delivering real improvements to carbon reduction, waste management and financial savings.\n\nA more detailed briefing on the application of such issues within the organisation is available as a separate document should it be required.\n\n1. Management Actions\n\nThe Carmarthenshire Trust has embraced all aspects of environmental management and sustainability as key objectives within its strategic and operational plans.\n\nThe Trust Board has fully supported this approach and empowered the Waste, Energy and Environmental Management Group to deliver on these policy objectives.\n\nA range of important management initiatives have been developed within this over-arching strategy which include:\n\n\tAn active Energy Awareness Campaign\n\tAppointment of local energy representatives (currently circa. 25 representatives appointed).\n\tOn-going Departmental Energy Audits to identify specific improvements on a local basis.\n\tExecutive Director representative on the NHS Carbon Management Programme (in partnership with the Carbon Trust).\n\tRegular facilitated workshops undertaken to identify energy saving measures from general staff employed within the organisation.\n\tThe appointment of two senior individuals within the Trust to deliver on energy and environmental management objectives.\n\tThe appointment of the Deputy Chief Executive in the role of Champion of energy and environmental waste management issues.\n\tFormal sign off by the Trust Board of the energy and carbon management policy, environment policy statement and waste policy statement.\n\tFinal work being concluded on the Green Dragon Accreditation process to ensure a quality based approach.\n\n\nExternal accreditation of management systems\n\nA number of independent audits have been undertaken on energy management within the organisation which have resulted in the Trust being identified as having significant assurance in demonstrating best practice standard of energy monitoring.\n\n2. Energy Management\n\nIn the previous financial year, the Trust expended circa. £1.72 million on utilities, excluding water supply.\n\nThe implementation of a number of specific initiatives has enabled the Trust to save, on a recurring basis, circa £183k on the above figure.  This is circa 10% of the overall budget.  The Trust continues to make excellent progress towards the Government target of 15% reduction in Primary Energy by 2010 from the baseline year of 1999/2000.  The Trust is currently less than 1% from this target and is confident this will be achieved well in advance of this deadline.\n\nIn addition to the above, the approved Trust policy dictates that any new project developed will achieve an excellent NEAT rating.  \n\nFuture investment plans include a major engineering infrastructure development prioritised programme valued at circa £7 million which will deliver further reductions in carbon produced and utility costs in addition to those noted above.  Work is on-going on these schemes to validate exact savings which can be realised.\n\nThe Trust is also prioritising sustainability improvement schemes within its discretionary capital investment programme on an annual basis.\n\n3. Carbon Reduction Programme\n\nIn the previous financial year, the Trust produced 7,475 tonnes of carbon emissions.  Following a range of on-going initiatives, the Trust is delighted to have already exceeded the Government target of reducing carbon emissions by 15% by 2010 from a base year of 1999/2000.  \n\nThe actual performance of the organisation is a reduction of 36%.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Trust has been successful in being accepted onto the second phase of the Carbon Management Programme, administered by the Carbon Trust, which is intended to deliver further efficiencies in both energy cost and CO2 emissions by applying best practice procedures.\n\n4. Water Management\n\nIn the previous financial year the Trust expended circa £280k in water supply.\n\nSignificant initiatives on-going within the Trust have identified a number of relatively small investments with a short payback period.  The Trust will save circa. £20k per annum on a recurring basis via these initiatives (this is circa 7% of the overall budget.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Trust has developed proactive water management procedures to promptly identify any issues such as leaks together with a number of significant investments in our infrastructure to avoid such future problems.\n\n5. Waste Management\n\nThe Trust produces circa. 1200 tonnes of waste per year.  This is made up of approximately 60% landfill to 40% clinical waste.  \n\nThe Trust fully appreciates the impact of these significant waste disposal figures and has taken proactive action in terms of management initiatives to deliver improvements.\n\nThe main initiatives include:\n\n\tDevelopment of a sustainable waste policy statement and strategy.\n\tA successful bid to WAG for grant aid assistance to purchase cardboard baling machines for both acute sites.  The Trust is now diverting cardboard waste from landfill to cardboard bales as recyclable materials.  The Trust receives an income for such waste.\n\tThe implementation of waste streaming for non-confidential paper has been successfully delivered.  The Trust has again been successful in a grant application to the WAG for funding of the purchase of specialist bins for this use.  This waste is diverted away from the landfill waste tonnage which again improves sustainability and financial management.\n\tIn terms of future action, the Trust is now implementing a managed approach to waste management.  This will include such initiatives as:\n\tWaste manuals to identify staff actions required in terms of waste segregation.\n\tInnovative procurement contracts which will enable full recycling on a wide range of materials, i.e. glass, plastics, tins, metals and general packaging.  To enable this initiative to be implemented, a number of physical containment compounds are being constructed to facilitate new management arrangements.\n\n\n6. Environmental Management\n\nGreen Dragon accreditation at level 2 standard was achieved in January 2008 at the West Wales General Hospital.  Work continues to work towards level 3 by the end of March 08 at the hospital, and across the Trust following this achievement of this standard.   This will deliver a quality assured standard, which the Trust will need to maintain compliance with in the future.  The Trust will be subject to regular audits on this standard by approved accreditors facilitated by WAG.\n\n    \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            \n\t\t\t\tLlywodraeth Cynulliad Cymru|Hygyrchedd|Cymorth|Map o´r Wefan|Polisi Preifatrwydd|Telerau ac Amodau \n            \n\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n       \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n        \t\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n",

Instead these questions have been consistently dodged by the government promising referendums on them at some unspecified future dates.\n\nToday it is in the interests of both Labour and the Conservatives to continue to keep Europe out of British politics in this way.\n\nToday the mainstream of Labour instinctively is pro-European, even if it is less easy to name the concrete policies through which that instinct might express itself. What is important, though, is that Labour fears that British voters are essentially right wing - the whole New Labour project was predicated on this belief. Therefore they believe that any return of Europe to the centre of British political debate is bound to harm them.\n\nAt the same time, while the Tories remain viscerally anti-European, the more thoughtful amongst them have decided that this view has contributed to the voters' perception that the Conservative Party is old-fashioned and out of touch with the modern world.\n\nSo we have a situation where one of the major parties is pro-European, the other is anti-European and both are scared of mentioning it to the voters.\n\nAnd I cannot have been the only Liberal Democrat councillor who has found himself telling someone opposed to the single currency that he should vote for us because we have promised to hold a referendum on the subject. I am not the most pro-European Lib Dem you will ever meet, so this was a way for me to dodge the question too.\n\nCould it be that this unwillingness to talk about such an important issue is one of the cause of the current public disenchantment with parliamentary politics? That the voters don't trust the politicians because the politicians don't trust the voters?\n\nContrast today's situation with the 1975 referendum campaign. Then the senior pro-European politicians from all the parties took on the forces of reaction and won both the debate and the vote. And don't forget that those forces include a powerful trade union movement that was better organised than anything pro-Europeans would face today, though it would be interesting to know how the press behaved in 1975. Was it as hostile to Europe as it would be today?\n\nFrom all this I conclude that it would be good for British politics for Gordon Brown to call a referendum on the new EU reform treaty.\n\nInstinctively, I am against referendums. The British system involves representative democracy - what George Watson calls The English Ideology - and I have a lot of sympathy for Mrs Thatcher's view (I cannot find the quotation at present) that referendums have been the instrument of tyrants down the ages.\n\nBut having damaged British politics by taking Europe out of political debate, our leaders should now start to repair that damage by returning European questions to the centre of that debate through a referendum.\n\nJeremy Hargreaves fears that a referendum on the reform treaty would not really be about that treaty at all and turn into a general vote about the government. This is an argument I have used in the past, but I am not sure it is correct. This didn't happen in 1975 and it didn't happen in the devolution referendums either.\n\nI wonder if this fear of calling a referendum is just another example of the fear of the people that has got our politicians into such a mess over Europe in the first place.\n\nLabels: Europe\n\n\n          # posted by Jonathan : 12:24 PM\n          \n\n\t\t\n\n \n  \n\t\n\t\t\tComments:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tI agree 100 percent Jonathan. And yes you are NOT \"the only Liberal Democrat councillor who has found himself telling someone opposed to the single currency that he should vote for us because we have promised to hold a referendum on the subject\"   I've been there too!\n\nAnd there's an unwillingness to talk about immigration as well. The Daily Telegraph has a series of reasoned reports on the subject today - but it's an issue that we shy away from for various reasons - do a search for the word on Lib Dem Blogs and you don't find many entries - most of the results seem to be from the Freethink Blog.\n\nThe issue of immigration isn't going to go away and isn't going to be easily managed - climate change will make sure of that. We need to stay connected to the public by being willing to discuss it.  Talk about the benefits that immigration can bring but also be active on the problems that come as well...(and that's speaking as someone whose family is two-thirds born abroad....)\n\n\t\t\t\t# posted by  Chris Black : 05 August, 2007 14:40\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tJonathan\n\nIn answer to your question about the position of the press in 1975, on polling day the (already Murdoch-owned) Sun published a leader pointing out how the EEC had not diminished national characteristics at all, and telling people to vote yes. This gives some idea of how things have changed! It's also widely argued that people's attitude towards politicians was very different then - much greater deference and respect. \n\nIn the argument above think you are conflating two things. I don't see any chance at all that a referendum supposedly about the Treaty would actually be about the Treaty (reform to the composition of the commission, QMV voting weights, renaming the CFSP High Representative, etc) It might possibly be generally about Europe, and whether people wanted to be in or out of the EU. This is closer, but still not the answer to the question. \n\nSome are arguing for a straight vote on whether the UK should remain part of the EU or not. I think there is a case for this, though I still wouldn't support it. Part of the reason for this is that I don't think any serious UK politician would support Britain actually leaving the EU, which reflects how much of a sensible option that would really be. \n\nSuch a vote could be useful to Brown, however, as it would put the Tories right on the spot, and force Cameron to show whether he is really a moderniser or not. He would not want to support a no vote in it - that really would be the end of his attempt to portray himself as modernised and moderate - but not doing so would also seriously upset the swivel-eyed tendency in his own party and to the right of it.\n\n\t\t\t\t# posted by  Jeremy Hargreaves : 06 August, 2007 09:15\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRegarding your distaste for referendums, the facts in Central and Eastern Europe show that most of the 30 new national constitutions were enacted by national referendums. More and/or better democracy does not mean more elections, but a more direct, substantial and differentiated involvement of citizens in political decision-making. That is why the number of national referendums in the 1990s was more than triple the number of referendums in the 1980s: of the 405 national referendums worldwide between 1990 and 2000, 248 were held in Europe and more than 10% of these concerned questions around the European integration process.  Switzerland is a major exponent of rule by referendum and contrary to Thatcher’s views on this respect, no tyranny is in sight.\n\nOf course, referendum is not a panacea but an instrument for democratic expression when legislative action does not satisfy the majority of constituents or even more when legislative action is subjected to an impasse that must be broken for the good of the country or region involved.  The argument that most issues are too complicated for ordinary people and that therefore referendums should not be provided for, would mean not only the end of democracy, but also the disintegration of Europe as a consensual unit of their peoples.\n\nHowever, referendums should never be used to decide major divisive questions that strongly polarize public opinion to the point of creating an aggressive rivalry among sectors or groups of the country’s or region’s population.  For example, suppose a country has two main linguistic groups, with one language being spoken by 60 per cent of the population and the other by 40 per cent, and constant political tensions over the language issue. If a referendum were held to resolve the question of which should become the country's sole language, this would solve nothing, because the minority group would be unlikely to accept the majority vote in favour of the other language as a fair way of resolving the dispute.\n\nRegarding the background, history and recent developments of the European Union and its quest for a Constitution, I recommend those interested in these issues to visit the informative pages found in http://participatorydemocracy.net, where many views on the question of referendums & plebiscites might be found in their “DOCUMENTS” section.  One of their WEB pages on the E.U. issue (here:  http://democraciaparticipativa.net/mambo/content/view/40/43/) is particularly interesting.\n\n:::Gerardo E.

          "Jane Hutt announces new national standards for children’s health\nJane Hutt announces new national standards for children’s health \n\n\nAssembly Health and Social Services Minister Jane Hutt, today (Thursday 20 \nSeptember) announced her decision to develop a National Service Framework for \nchildren’s health services in Wales. Its purpose will be to set national \nstandards for the provision of health services for all children from birth \nthrough childhood and adolescence into adulthood.\n\nSpeaking at the Children in Wales Conference, the Minister said: \"The health \nof the children of Wales is amongst the highest priorities of the National \nAssembly. We recognise the importance of ensuring that all children and young \npeople have access to the best possible health services to ensure that they \nreach their potential to achieve healthy satisfying lives. \n\n\"Investment in the health and well being of children is one of the most \nimportant contributions that we can make to the future health of our nation. \n\n\n\"I have therefore decided that it is essential that we establish national \nstandards to ensure that we have a modern children’s health service that \nprovides an efficient and responsive service to all children and their families \nthroughout Wales.\"\n\nDr John Morgan, Chair of the Welsh Committee of the Royal College of \nPaediatrics, welcomed the decision and said: \"Establishing national standards \nfor the provision of health services for every child in Wales is exciting and \nchallenging for all concerned and we look forward to taking a major role in this \nprocess. \n\n\"We have a real opportunity to make an impact on the shape of health services \nfor children for the future. We are particularly mindful of the need to ensure \nthat sustainable tertiary services are provided in Wales.\"\n\nNotes \n\nNSFs set national standards and define service models for a specific service \nor care group. They also put in place programmes to support implementation and \nestablish performance measures against which progress will be measured.\n\nThere will be close liaison between the National Assembly and the Department \nof Health during the process to ensure that common principles are established. \n\n\nThe NSF will cover services provided from birth up to and including the age \nof 18. It will also have enough elasticity to cover the services spanning the \ntransition into adulthood. \n\n(20 September 2001)\n",

Given the opportunity to meet your soul, would you take it?\n\nThese were not questions I thought about much until I read Northern Lights, by Philip Pullman. In the novel, and the others in the ‘His Dark Materials’ trilogy, Pullman conjures up worlds where humans’ souls live on the outside of their bodies as animals. These animals, dæmons, speak to their humans, and accompany them throughout their lives and adventures. As I put Northern Lights down, I realised with a sigh how much I would love to have a dæmon of my own. \n\nAlmost eight years have passed, but my wish for a dæmon has not faded away at all. In the books, as children pass into adulthood, their dæmon ceases changing shape into different animals, and remains in one shape. I was propelled through the trilogy by a burning desire to know if Pantalaimon, (dæmon of the story’s heroine, Lyra) would ever stop changing his shape – and which animal he would finally stay as. I wonder what animal my own would be – and at what point in my life it stopped changing. And yesterday, I came a step closer to finding out.\n\nHis Dark Materials has been adapted for the stage, and now a film is coming out, resplendent with a magical website to accompany it. Grit your teeth for the American adaptation of ‘Northern Lights’ to “Golden Compass Movie”, visit www.goldencompassmovie.com, and…you too can meet your dæmon.\n\n               \n\n\n               Posted in Internet,  Entertainment,  Amusement |   6 Comments »\n \n\n            \n\n\n                  \n               Fines for putting the bins out on the wrong day\n\n               Sunday, April 22nd, 2007\n\n               \n                  Jo: One regret from the easter holidays: scaring off the kind man who reminds us about the bins each week. Without his helpful visits, our household is certain to join thousands of others across the nation incurring fines for putting their bins out on the wrong day. Since legislation was introduced last year enabling councils to fine errant bin-behaviour, more than £185,000 worth of fixed penalties have been issued. I wish I had just taken my alarming pot plant with me on holiday. Now, I fear I am going to have to learn the bin-days the hard way.\n\n\n               \n\n\n               Posted in Current Affairs,  Environment |   No Comments »\n \n\n            \n\n\n                  \n               Look them in the eye\n\n               Monday, April 16th, 2007\n\n               \n                  Jo: It shouldn’t seem all that shocking: A new study by the University of New Hampshire in the US  has shown that holding a hysterical suspect’s gaze can calm the person. This may bring about a revolution in alternative policing methods: or it may just be the triumph of common sense. I think more eye contact is just what we all need.\n\nWe make eye contact when being Better Listeners (for Better Sales), and Better At Receiving Gifts (so we will be remembered in wills), and yet more often than not, waiters, cashiers and kind door-holders go unseen. And by seen, I mean looked at. Looked at in the eye.  As I notice more and more people mumbling their thanks and turning away, it is hard to credit their mumbled thanks with anything heartfelt at all.  \n\nAs the New Hampshire study shows, eye contact is powerful. It can calm a suspect; transfix an enemy, or conduct love at first sight. But it can also let someone know that their job is worthwhile – or that their effort was appreciated. A good habit to get into. \n\n               \n\n\n               Posted in Uncategorized |   1 Comment »\n \n\n            \n\n\n         \n         \n            \n\n            \n\n         \n\n\n      \n      \n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tiblog is proudly powered by \n\t\tWordPress\n\t\t\nEntries (RSS)\n\t\tand Comments (RSS).\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis blog is protected by dr Dave's Spam Karma 2: 100602  Spams eaten and counting...\n",

Schwippel describes the attempts to force through the ratification as party of a 'European-wide conspiracy against the European Union...to isolate Ireland' which Tlusty claims was 'probably the result of a deal...to make Topolanek a Commissioner.'\n\nSpeaking of the ?betrayal? of their hard-fought national sovereignty to the ?undemocratic elites in Brussels?, both men make it clear why standing for a pan-European movement committed to reform is their only real option for bringing democracy and accountability back to their own country.\n\nTheir remarks come only days after after Nobel Peace Prize winner and champion of Polish freedom Lech Walesa, told the Libertas pan-European convention audience in Rome that voters across the EU27 must ?heed the Libertas message and put the people back at the heart of the project.?\nThe video can be viewed online here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aba97Gj9Qhs&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertas.eu%2F&feature=player_embedded\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLibertas UK demands MEPs bare all in cheeky stunt\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFirst ever on-line vote cast in European elections\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOnline Voting in Estonia\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLibertas: Majority European Parliament vote needed in only ONE of 1799 European laws\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t?No? on Lisbon can be Used as an Opt-out for the Endangered Cultures of Europe\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLibertas Europe\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t?esk? republika\n\n\tDeutschland\n\tEesti\n\tEspa?a\n\tFrance\n\tMagyarorszag\n\tIreland\n\tNederland\n\tLatvija\n\tPolska\n\tSverige\n\tUnited Kingdom\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSite Map\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
