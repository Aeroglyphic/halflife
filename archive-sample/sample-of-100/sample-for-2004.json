She quickly established links with the City of Gloucester, displaying the city arms prominently on deck and having many natives of the city and county serving in her Ship’s Company. She was commissioned in October 1910 and paid her first visit to her adopted city in January 1911. A notorious gift of a pugnacious bull terrier by the name of Bounce was presented to the ship.\n\n\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Gloucester was in the Eastern Mediterranean and was sent to intercept the Breslau, a German light cruiser, and the Goeben, a battle cruiser. Gloucester achieved instant fame for her high speed pursuit although both the German ships managed to escape. At the end of 1914 she was transferred to the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow where she remained for the rest of the war and was amongst the fleet at the Battle of Jutland.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \t\n         Battle Honours\n\n\t\n        Jutland\t\n        1916\n\t\n        Statistics\n\n\t\n        Launched\t\n        1909\n\t\n        Built\t\n        Dalmuir\n\t\n        Tonnage\t\n        4,800\n\t\n        Armament\t\n        2 x 6\" & 10 x 4\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The overall level of the advice has not changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\n\t\nThere is no British Embassy in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIf you wish to travel outside Malabo on the island of Bioko, or outside Bata on the mainland, you will need to inform Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and Francophonie in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nThe threat from terrorism is low but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreigners.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nWe strongly recommend that you obtain comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAFETY AND SECURITY\n\n\n\nTerrorism\n\n\n \n\n\nThe threat from terrorism is low but you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be against civilian targets, including places frequented by foreigners. Please read Security and General Tips and Risk of Terrorism when Travelling Overseas pages for information and advice.\n\n\n \n\n\nCrime\n\n\n \n\n\nCompared to other countries in the region, the level of violent crime in Equatorial Guinea is not high. But there are regular reports of petty theft affecting both visitors and expatriates. We recommend that you take sensible personal security precautions. You should avoid carrying valuables or wearing jewellery in public and avoid isolated or poorer areas of town. You should not walk around Malabo and Bata at night and should also avoid travelling by road after dark.\n\n\n \n\n\nPolitical Situation\n\n\n \n\n\nPolitical events can lead to increased presence of police, military or security forces on the streets. This can happen with little or no notice. You should carry copies of appropriate documentation (passport or residence permit) with you at all times. Failure to produce documents on request can lead to detention.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou should avoid any political rallies, demonstrations or large public gatherings.\n\n\n \n\n\nLocal Travel\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you wish to travel outside Malabo on the island of Bioko, or outside Bata on the mainland, you will need to inform Protocol Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and Francophonie in advance.\n\n\n \n\n\nMost roads in Malabo are paved. In rural areas the condition of the roads is likely to be poor. During the rainy season many roads are accessible only with a four-wheel drive vehicle.\n\n\n \n\n\nPolice and military roadblocks are common. You may be asked to show your passport, driving licence or vehicle registration documents and explain your reason for being in the area. Failure to comply with requests can lead to detention.\n\n\n \n\n\nThere are regular reports of extortion by police and uniformed security forces at roadblocks. You are advised not to pay bribes but to ask for a ticket that can be paid at a local court.\n\n\n \n\n\nPublic transport facilities, particularly on mainland Equatorial Guinea, are extremely limited.\n\n\n \n\n\nLand borders are often closed with little or no notice. They are currently reported to be open. We recommend that you check the situation with the local authorities before travelling.\n\n\n \n\n\nAir Safety\n\n\n \n\n\nAirlines and aircraft registered in Equatorial Guinea are currently banned from flying in UK airspace because of concerns about the ability of the aeronautical authorities in Equatorial Guinea to oversee the safety of airlines and aircraft on their register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS\n\n\n\nPenalties for the use and possession of drugs are severe and usually include a prison sentence that would be served in local prisons.\n\n\n \n\n\nPhotography of the presidential palace, ports, airports and military installations is strictly prohibited and can lead to imprisonment. Special permits from the Ministry of Information and Tourism are required for all other photography.\n\n\n \n\n\nHomosexuality is not widely accepted in Central African society and some sexual acts between members of the same sex are illegal.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou should carry copies of appropriate documentation (passport or residence permit) with you at all times. Failure to produce documents on request can lead to detention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nBritish nationals require a visa to visit Equatorial Guinea. To apply for a visa and to obtain further information on entry requirements, please contact the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Paris: 29 Boulevard de Courselles, Floor 4, 75800, Paris, tel: +33 66 14 01 401, fax: +33 1 42 25 23 12.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou may be asked to produce a yellow fever vaccination certificate on arrival in the country. Failure to do so may result in a further vaccination being administered, for which a charge is made.\n\n\n \n\n\nSingle parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that some countries require documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration please contact the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Paris: 29 Boulevard de Courselles, Floor 4, 75800, Paris, Tel: +33 66 14 01 401, Fax: +33 1 42 25 23 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEALTH\n\n\n\nWe strongly recommend that you obtain comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.\n\n\n \n\n\nMedical facilities are poor. Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medication. Emergency facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, evacuation to Europe would be necessary. Water-borne diseases and malaria are prevalent. Current information on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is unavailable.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou are advised to take medical advice before travelling and ensure that all appropriate vaccinations are up to date. For further information visit the Department of Health’s website at www.dh.gov.uk or contact your GP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL\n\n\n\nThere is no British Embassy in Equatorial Guinea. In an emergency, you can obtain consular assistance from the British Honorary Consul in Malabo (tel: +240 248725).\n\n\n \n\n\nWe encourage visitors staying longer than one month to register with the Honorary Consul.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe nearest British diplomatic mission is in Yaoundé, Cameroon (contact details below). You can also contact the British Consulate in Douala, Cameroon:- Standard Chartered Bank Cameroon SA, Boulevard de la Liberté, BP 1016, Douala, tel: +237 3 422 177 or 3 428 145, fax: +237 3 428 896, email: bcdouala@yahoo.co.uk.\n\n\n \n\n\nIt is not possible to use credit cards in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER\n\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea Country Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT DETAILS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nAddress:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\nBritish High Commission\nAvenue Winston Churchill \nBP 547 \nYaounde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nTelephone:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n(237) 222 05 45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n(237) 222 07 96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nFacsimile:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n(237) 222 01 48 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nBHC.yaounde@fco.gov.uk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nOffice Hours:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\nGMT: Mon-Thurs: 0645 - 1145, 1300 - 1445\nFri: 0645 - 1245\n\nLocal: Mon-Thurs: 0745 - 1245, 1400 - 1545\nFri: 0745 - 1345\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nWebsite:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.britcam.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nSee Also:\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\n\n\nUK Overseas Mission: Equatorial Guinea\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\n\n\nThe FCO strongly recommends that all travellers abroad take out comprehensive insurance.\n\n\n\nNB:  While every care has been taken in preparing our travel advice, neither Her Majesty's Government nor any member of British consular staff abroad can accept liability for injury, loss or damage arising in any respect of any statement contained therein.\n\n\n\tLATEST TRAVEL UPDATES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongo\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nBermuda\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nTurkmenistan\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nPanama\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nEgypt\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nTunisia\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nThailand\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nCuba\n\n\n(26/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nSerbia and Montenegro\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nParaguay\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nBolivia\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nUruguay\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n(25/10/04)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL TERRORISM WARNING\n\nYou should be aware of the risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks in public places anywhere in the world.

          "Foreign & Commonwealth Ofﬁce London, July 2000 \nFOCUS INTERNATIONAL\nBRITAIN’S OVERSEAS TERRITORIES \nIn March 1999, the British Government issued a\nWhite Paper, “Partnership for Progress and\nProsperity”, on its relationship with the 13 British\nOverseas Territories. This paper looks at progress\nsince then in important areas of the relationship. \nAN FCO NETWORK FEATURE2\nBRITAIN’S OVERSEAS TERRITORIES \nBritain’s 13 Overseas Territories, spread throughout the globe, are diverse\n1\ncommunities . They range from the tiny island of Pitcairn with its 54 inhabitants, set in the\nmiddle of the Paciﬁc Ocean, to Bermuda, which has a population of 60,000 and is one of the\nworld’s major ﬁnancial centres. They have long-standing links with Britain, sharing many\ncommon values and beliefs, such as in self-determination, democratic government and\nindividual freedoms. In March 1999, a White Paper entitled “Partnership for Progress and\nProsperity” set out the British Government’s policy for strengthening and modernising its\nrelationship with the Overseas Territories, to take the partnership into the new Millennium. \nThe partnership is based on four principles: \nself-determination for the Territories; \n!\nmutual obligations and responsibilities; \n!\nfreedom for the Territories to run their own affairs to the greatest degree\n!\npossible; and \nBritain’s firm commitment to promote economic development in the\n!\nTerritories and to help them in emergencies. \nThe White Paper was the outcome of a lengthy review of Britain’s policy towards the\nOverseas Territories (formerly known as the Dependent Territories). The objectives of the\nreview were to: \nimprove communication between the British Government and the\n!\ngovernments of the Territories; \nimprove the status of residents of the Territories; and \n!\nensure that Britain could fulﬁl its international responsibilities in respect of the\n!\nTerritories. \nThe White Paper made recommendations on citizenship; administrative and representational\narrangements; good governance and human rights; and protecting the environment while\npromoting economic development. \n1\nThe Overseas Territories are: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean\nTerritory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Pitcairn,\nSouth Georgia & South Sandwich Islands, St Helena, and Turks & Caicos Islands.3\nCitizenship \nDuring the review, all the Overseas Territories conﬁrmed that they wished to retain\ntheir constitutional ties with Britain; none preferred independence. The British Government\nhas offered British citizenship, together with the right of abode, to people in the Overseas\n2\nTerritories who qualify, although it is unlikely that large numbers will choose to take up\npermanent residence in the United Kingdom (UK). Citizenship will be non-reciprocal;\nresidents of the UK will not have the right of abode in the Overseas Territories, as the size of\nthe Territories and their populations would not allow the inﬂux of possibly large numbers of\noutsiders. Those in the Overseas Territories who do not want full British citizenship can\nremain British Dependent Territories Citizens. People who do take advantage of the new\nstatus will gain the right to travel freely throughout the European Union (EU) and, if they go\nto Britain to study, will be entitled to support themselves by working during that time. \nGood government and human rights \nGood government is an essential element of being a British Overseas Territory. The\nWhite Paper highlighted a number of areas which are fundamental components of good\ngovernment and respect for human rights, and where the British Government would like to\nsee further progress in some of the Territories. \nTo promote open and accountable government \ngovernments should explain their decisions and policies to the electorate; \n!\nIegislatures should encourage public attendance at, and open reporting of,\n!\ntheir meetings; and \ngovernment bodies should ensure speedy publication of their debates and\n!\ndecisions. \nTo enable the public to make informed decisions, there should be \nfreedom of speech and information, including free and effective media\n!\norganisations. \n2\nThose who do not qualify are British Overseas Citizens and people whose British Dependent\nTerritories citizenship is due to links with the British Indian Ocean Territory or the Sovereign Bases\non Cyprus.4\nTo improve the composition and operation of legislatures and Executive Councils, the\nTerritories should ensure that \ntheir electoral processes are fair and inclusive; \n!\ngovernments put into practice the concept of collective responsibility for\n!\npolicies and decisions; and \nthose holding elected ofﬁces maintain the highest standards of probity. \n!\nTo improve the standards of public service, including efﬁciency, accountability and\nimpartiality, governments should ensure that \ndelivery of services is based on publicised standards and performance targets; \n!\nservices are focussed on the needs of the customer; and \n!\nstaff are well trained. \n!\nAll the Overseas Territories’ legal systems are based on that of England and Wales,\nincluding the principles of independence for the judiciary and impartiality. To ensure respect\nfor the rule of law and the Constitution, and to provide high standards of justice, \npolicing must be by consent; \n!\npolice forces must be properly trained; \n!\ncustoms work needs to be enhanced, especially to combat drug trafﬁcking; \n!\nprison services should be improved; and \n!\nlegislation needs to be reformed to ensure the same standards of human rights\n!\nas in Britain, in such areas as the abolition of capital and judicial corporal\npunishment and the decriminalisation of consensual homosexual acts. \nBritain is already working, and will continue to work, with the governments of the\nOverseas Territories to raise standards, where necessary, in these ﬁelds. For instance, its Good\nGovernment Fund supports programmes to improve all aspects of public service management. \nDevelopment aid \nMany of the Overseas Territories have economies based on limited resources; six of\nthe poorest and most vulnerable receive development assistance from the British5\nGovernment. The aims of this assistance, administered by the Department for International\nDevelopment (DFID) and totalling £48 million in 1998/9, are to \nmaximise the Territories’ economic growth and self-sufﬁciency; \n!\nensure that basic needs are met, including essential infrastructure; and \n!\nsupport good government. \n!\nMontserrat and St Helena receive budgetary aid. In view of Montserrat’s special\nproblems during ongoing volcanic eruptions which began in 1995, it received nearly £60\nmillion in the ﬁrst three years of the crisis, and has been allocated a further £75 million for\nthe following three years. The emphasis now is on health, education, housing and\ndevelopment of the private sector. \nOther assistance to the Territories includes co-ﬁnancing of capital projects and\ninfrastructure, and technical assistance. There are, for instance, regional projects in the\nCaribbean to improve good government. In Anguilla, Montserrat and the Turks & Caicos\nIslands, DFID is helping with law reform and with the revision of laws, to reﬂect the present-\nday needs of the Territories and to ensure that their laws conform to international standards.\nIn the same Territories, DFID is running a project to modernise and reform government\nﬁnancial and accounting policies, systems and procedures. \nAn important project in the ﬁeld of health focusses on the prevention and control of\nHIV/AIDS in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and the Turks & Caicos\nIslands. DFID has given technical support for the development of national plans, laboratory\nquality assurance programmes, publicity material aimed at vulnerable groups and for the\nelectronic exchange of information on HIV/AIDS. In St Helena, DFID is working to improve\nthe quality and quantity of agricultural products through an integrated pest management\nproject. It has also increased the supply of electricity by rehabilitating diesel power\ngenerators and providing three wind turbines, which now produce 13 per cent of the island’s\nelectricity requirements. \nThe Overseas Territories contain a range of habitats and environments of global\nsigniﬁcance. An important aspect of British aid to the Territories – as well as in the wider\nprogramme throughout the rest of the world – is help with conserving and managing the\nenvironment. In addition to funds from DFID to support poorer Territories in dealing with\nenvironmental issues, Overseas Territories also beneﬁt from projects under the Darwin\nInitiative (administered by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions\n(DETR)). Among these are projects on: invertebrate diversity on Gough Island (near Tristan\nda Cunha, a dependency of St Helena, and now a World Heritage Site); infrastructure to\nconserve biodiversity in Anguilla; and biodiversity management in wetlands in the Turks &\nCaicos Islands. 6\nIn June 1999, the Foreign & Commonwealth Ofﬁce (FCO) and a number of non-\ngovernmental organisations organised a conference in London to discuss ideas for an\nEnvironmental Charter for the Overseas Territories. Britain hopes that the Charter will\nprovide a framework for all Overseas Territories to play a part in developing policies on the\nenvironment, as well as helping them to implement effectively the appropriate multilateral\nenvironmental agreements to which Britain is a party. A new £1.5 million fund for\nenvironmental issues in the Territories, set up by the FCO, will help this process. \nFinancial regulation \nA number of the Territories, especially those in the Caribbean, have successful off-\nshore ﬁnancial industries, which contribute greatly to their prosperity. They are, however,\noften targets of money launderers, because of their geographical position close to countries\nwhich are major producers and consumers of illegal drugs. They are also attractive to people\ninvolved in fraud and tax evasion. The White Paper pointed out that, to avoid such problems,\nthe governments of the Overseas Territories should take action, where necessary, to ensure\nthat their ﬁnancial industries operated and were regulated to accepted international standards. \nIn December 1999, the British Government and the governments of Anguilla,\nBermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks & Caicos\nagreed jointly to fund and commission consultants to carry out a review of ﬁnancial\nregulation in those Territories. The review is examining practices and legislation covering the\nbanking, insurance and securities sectors, companies and trusts and the independence of\nregulatory authorities, as well as measures against money laundering and arrangements for\ninternational cooperation. It will recommend any further action needed to bring performance\nin these areas up to the required standards. \nCombating illegal drugs \nThe Overseas Territories in the Caribbean (and other countries in the region) are\nvulnerable to the threat of drug trafﬁcking. They are taking steps to tackle the problems of\nboth supply and consumption of drugs, and receive considerable help from Britain in doing\nso. The West Indies Guardship, provided by Britain, conducts counter-drugs patrols in the\nregion, and an important element of the work of the British Military Advisory and Training\nTeam, based in Antigua, focusses on combating trafﬁcking. The Caribbean Overseas\nTerritories have access to a vessel, provided by Britain at a cost of around £500,000, used by\ncoastguards from various Caribbean countries for drugs interdiction. They can call on the\nexperience and expertise of a Caribbean-wide network of British Drugs Liaison Ofﬁcers. And\nthere is also a Caribbean Overseas Territories Drugs Law Enforcement Adviser, based in\nMiami, who is available to provide advice and guidance to Governors’ ofﬁces and\ngovernments in the Territories. 7\nThe Territories participate in regional projects under the EU Caribbean Drugs\nInitiative, a ﬁve-year programme, started in 1996, which aims to tackle all aspects of the drug\ntrade in the Caribbean. And they beneﬁt from the close cooperation on drugs between Britain\nand the United States, which is probably more effective in the Caribbean than in any other\nregion of the world. \nCloser consultation \nThe White Paper stressed the need for close consultation between Britain and the\nOverseas Territories, especially over modernising the structures and practices involved in the\nTerritories’ governance. A new Overseas Territories Consultative Council has been set up,\nbringing together British Ministers with responsibility for the Territories (from the FCO,\nHome Ofﬁce, DETR and DFID) with Chief Ministers from the Territories, or in some cases\nwith Legislative Council Members. \nThe Council’s ﬁrst meeting, in London from 19-20 October 1999, dealt with three\nmain themes: the relationship between Britain and the Overseas Territories; the Overseas\nTerritories in a changing world; and sustainable development and the environment. The\nBritish Government aims for this consultation mechanism to develop into a comprehensive\nand substantial political dialogue, which will help create a more modern and effective\npartnership between Britain and all the Territories. \naJuly 2000a \nYour comments on the usefulness of this paper are welcome on the \nFCO web site facility: http://www.fco.gov.uk/feedback.asp \n"]},

She was commissioned into the Royal Navy the following year and was the first purpose built 74 gun ship of the line to serve. Her design provided much information to British Naval architects.\n\n\n\nThe second was a third-rate 74-gun ship launched at Deptford in 1765 and commissioned in Portsmouth in 1776. She had an illustrious career including action in the great naval battles of Cape St Vincent against the Spanish Fleet, and St Kitts and \"The Glorious First of June\" against the French Fleet. She was also involved in the capture of St Lucia, Trinidad and Surinam from the French. Sadly, she was wrecked off the Norfolk coast in 1801 with the loss of 400 lives, including her captain.\n\n\n\nNumber three was again a 74-gun third-rate, launched at Woolwich in 1808.  She saw action in the Peninsular wars in support of Wellington's troops. She was paid off in 1814 ending her days as a depot ship in Plymouth and broken up in 1861.\n\n\n\nThe fourth Invincible, an armour plated “broadside battleship” could be powered by either sail or steam, and was built by Napier on the Clyde in 1869. She saw action in the Egyptian War of 1882 bombarding forts ashore at Meks and landing a Naval brigade. She was relegated to depot ship duties in Portsmouth and foundered undertow off Portland in 1914.\n\n\n\nThe fifth Invincible a battlecruiser was built by Armstrong Whitworth on the Tyne in 1907 and launched in 1909. She had an armament that included eight 12 inch guns. She was involved in the First World War battles of Heligoland and the Falkland Islands, during which Invincible and Inflexible sank the Scharnhorst and Gneisnau. She was again involved in leading the fleet into action at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Invincible came under heavy fire, one shell piercing a gun turret and igniting the magazine below. She broke in two and sank in a matter of seconds, with the loss of all but 6 of her crew of 1,000.\n\n\n\nThe present Invincible, which is the sixth ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name and the first of the Invincible Class of Anti-Submarine Warfare Carriers, was laid down at the Barrow-in-Furness yard of Vickers Shipbuilders Limited in July 1973 and was launched by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II on 3 May 1977.  She served with distinction in the Falklands Campaign in 1982, in the Adriatic Operation ‘DENY FLIGHT’ between 1993 and 1995 and in the bombing campaign ‘DELIBERATE FORCE’ in Bosnia in 1995.  More recently, in 1998 and 1999, her FA2 Sea Harriers flew air combat patrols to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Southern Iraq during Operation ‘BOLTON’.  This was followed by a short notice Operational deployment to the Balkans to take part in Operation ‘ALLIED FORCE’ where, once again, the FA2 Sea Harriers provided protection for NATO air forces whilst her helicopters supported the aid programme to refugees during the height of the Crisis.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \t\n        Battle Honours\n\n\tSt Vincent\t1780\tSt Kitts\t1782\n\tGlorious First of June\t1794\tAlexandria\t1882\n\tHeligoland\t1914\tFalklands Islands\t1914\n\tJutland\t1916\tFalklands Islands\t1982\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

Personal injury from flying debris and falling trees is likely to\nincrease.\nInjuries resulting from people being blown over in high winds is likely during severe\nwindstorms.An increase in traffic accidents is also probable.\nAnalysis of a worst-case scenario - a windstorm in the late afternoon in London and south-\neast England - suggests that such an event might be associated with several hundred deaths,\nseveral hundreds of admissions to hospital and many minor injuries. It is likely that the NHS\nwould cope adequately with a disaster of this scale.\nThe need for a review of building regulations for roofs and other vulnerable structures is clear;\nwith adequate planning many injuries and deaths might be prevented.\n4.5.1 Introduction\nSevere wind events can be classified in two groups, as temperate wind storms and tropical cyclones\n(hurricanes and typhoons). Living in the British Isles and exposed to North Atlantic depressions\nwe experience more frequent gales than continental Europe and the effects of climate change on\nwind systems could have more adverse implications.The main features of temperate windstorms\nare that strong winds occur across a track that may be 1000 km wide, and they occur relatively\nfrequently. It has been argued that any one point sees a random population of storm speeds in the\ncourse of each year which, from the viewpoint of statistical data manipulation and predictions, is\nequivalent to experiencing about 50 independent storms.Tropical cyclones, in contrast, are much\nless frequent and very high wind speeds are restricted to a relatively narrow track, perhaps 150 km\nwide.\n1\nAlthough both winds and the associated low atmospheric pressure influence the risks of sea surge ,\nin a temperate climate these risks are usually secondary to the structural damage caused by the\nwind gust pressures, which are proportional to the square of the wind gust speed. Gust speeds in\nthe UK reach 50 m/s, but higher values are experienced in tropical cyclones, up to 70 m/s, giving\npressures typically double the UK values. Death and injury from tropical cyclones are very\ncommonly associated with flooding (extremely severe concurrent rainfall is typical, over a larger\narea and extending further inland than the high winds), consequential landslides, and from the sea\n2\nsurge. The climate change scenarios for the UK suggest that gust velocities and windstorm\nfrequencies could increase, but it is not believed that climate change would be enough to replace\nthe present storm patterns by a tropical cyclone pattern.\n134\nooooIn addition to the large storms introduced above, extremely severe winds occur locally in\n2\ntornadoes, but these are individually very small, each event affecting an area of only 1 km to 10\n2\nkm . On average, 32 tornadoes occur each year in the UK, mostly in England; they represent a\n3\nminor wind hazard in this country, but their reported numbers are increasing. Uncertainty in the\nUK climate is particularly reflected in the October 1987 ‘hurricane’ in which exceptionally high\nwind speeds were recorded within a relatively narrow track across the south east corner of Britain.\nCurrent meteorological computer models have not yet reached the point where the trigger for\nsuch an event is sufficiently understood to provide a robust view of the place of such events in the\nfuture risk scenario.\nThis section focuses on the health impacts of temperate windstorms in the UK.The country’s\nworst ‘wind’ disaster was the collapse of the Tay Bridge on 28 December 1879, causing a train\ncarrying 79 passengers to plunge into the Tay. However, in most years, deaths and injuries from the\ndirect and indirect impacts of gales are small (on average, in 1962-1993, 6 deaths and 144 minor\n4\nand serious injuries per year ). Recent reference events that led to more substantial building\ndamage and significant loss of life in the UK were the windstorms in October 1987 and\nJanuary/February 1990. It is the impacts and return periods of these types of events that we\nconsider need to be addressed when assessing the effects of climate change on human health and\nsafety.\n4.5.2 Forcing factors\n2\nAccording to the Medium-High scenario of climate changethe overall gale frequencies in the UK\nwill decline in the future, though very severe summer and winter gales could increase.Wind speed\n(at 10 m above the ground) could increase by 4% in the south-east and by 7% in Scotland by the\n2080s. On the presumption that the basic storm processes and storm patterns remain similar, while\nscaled up by increasing severity of the large scale synoptic meteorological scenario, the above\nincreases could alternatively be viewed as a reduction in the return periods of given levels of storm\nspeeds by a factor of three. It would also be presumed that events such as the October 1987\nexample would be increased pro-rata.\nAn increase in wind speed of 7% is the equivalent of the difference in gales already experienced\nbetween Scotland and south-east England at the present time.Wind storms with gusts in excess of\n90 knots can be occasionally expected over the north of Northern Ireland and over western and\n5\nnorthern Scotland, but are remarkable for southern England . The impact of this change on\nstructural loading of buildings in the UK would be relatively small. However, the following analysis\nshows that wind storms already present significant hazards in the UK, and future climate trends\nwould need careful assessment for their impacts on human life and infrastructure.\n4.5.3 Reference events\nThe main reference events to consider are the windstorms in 1987 and 1990.\n15-16 October 1987. This storm made a swathe through south-east England with its\nmaximum intensity occurring at 2-6 am. Maximum gusts were at 90-100 knots in the most\nsoutherly areas (Figure 4.15a and 4.16a) within a triangle bounded by Southampton, Great\n5\nYarmouth and Dover .About 25 million people were affected.There were 21 deaths ascribed\nto the storm, but relatively few injuries as the majority of people were in bed at the peak of\n135\nothe storm. Caravans and mobile home parks sited with a view and so completely exposed to\nthe wind were particularly impacted.Trees were uprooted on a scale not seen before in living\nmemory. A combination of the trees being in full leaf and a high soil moisture at the time\ncontributed to the loss of an estimated 15 million trees (ten times higher than in 1990).\nThe storm on 25 January 1990 struck in daytime during working hours so the death toll was\n6,7\ngreater than in the 1987 event .The wind speeds were highest (90 knots) in an area of\nsouthern England and Wales below a line from Aberystwyth to Aldeburgh and the storm\nintensity peaked between 9 am and 3 pm (Figure 4.15b and 4.16b). Forty-seven deaths were\nattributed to the storm, with two children being killed and a further 69 injured from failure\nof school buildings. On 26 February 1990, another storm struck southern England, the\nwindiest hours between 6 am and 6 pm.The damage was mainly concentrated in areas of high\npopulation density: Greater Manchester,West Yorkshire, Newcastle upon Tyne and general\nimpacts across the Midlands to East Anglia and London.The storm led to at least 14 deaths.\nThese two major storms were linked by a period of increased winds over the British Isles,\nincluding a storm on 7/8 February.\nThe overall impression of the 1987 event is that within the narrow track of peak effects (say, the\nworst-affected 100 km track) this was a more unusual storm; i.e. it represented a longer return\nperiod than the 1990 storms, which had effects spread much more widely but in a rather patchy\nand variable fashion. The difference in deaths and injuries between the October 1987 and\nJanuary/February 1990 events was marked, and can be mainly ascribed to the different times of the\nday and night when the storms struck. In October 1997 the peak of the storm occurred while\npeople were asleep. In the 25 January event people were able to avoid going to work and to prevent\nmany children going to school, as the storm was already reaching its peak by 9 am and so the\nimpact was not as severe as it might have been.The 1987 event, in particular, took the public by\n8\nsurprise and the Met Office was heavily criticised by the media at the time .These storms provide\nthe basis for developing a worst foreseeable scenario for future extreme weather events. First, we\nanalyse the factors associated with death and injury.\n136\noFigure 4.15a\nHighest reported gusts (knots) over southern England and the near\n5\ncontinent, 16 October 1987\nFigure 4.15b\n6\nMaximum gusts recorded on 25 January 1990 and return periods (years)\n137Figure 4.16a\n7\nAnalysis of maximum winds (knots) for 16 October 1987\nFigure 4.16b\n7\nAnalysis of maximum winds (knots) for January 1990\n1384.5.4 Impacts of strong winds\nAn increase of wind speed of up to approximately 10% would have the effect of increasing the\nstructural loading by 20% (the pressure of the wind on a structure is proportional to the velocity\nsquared).This would have little effect on the vast majority of well built structures, but we estimate\nthat between two and five times more minor damage would occur overall as a result of the\nincreased loading.This is a potential problem for the insurance industry in the UK rather than for\nthe National Health Service. If wind speeds increased beyond 10% this could present a problem to\nstructures, but over time more rigorous building regulations could compensate for the growing\nhazard.\nCompared with the relatively small effect on buildings (except in insurance terms from claims), the\ndirect effect of stronger winds on people would be considerably greater.The propensity to be\nblown around by the wind can depend upon the clothing that is worn, so that winter clothing such\nas floppy coats can effectively double the drag coefficient which, in turn, could as much as double\nthe risk of being blown over in the open for a given wind velocity.The risk is greatest in streets\nand by the corners of buildings where wind can accelerate.Thus the increase in the risk of being\nblown over with the potential for injury by changing to winter clothing outweighs the risk of\ninjury from structural failures due to a 20% increase in loading from increased gust velocity.\nGusting winds will cause weak structures such as garden sheds and other outbuildings to collapse,\nand flying debris from these may cause injuries. Uprooting of trees is a significant problem in wind\nstorms and is related to the water content of the soil as well as wind velocity, so that trees more\nreadily blow over if the storm occurs after a period when the soil is wet. Collapsing trees and flying\ndebris may block roads and railway lines, and road links may also be blocked by accidents caused\nby vehicles being blown over or blown off the road. Damage to utility poles and overhead lines\nmay disrupt communications and power supplies.The consequences of vulnerable infrastructure\nbeing impacted (transport, communications, power supplies) are of major significance to human\nhealth and safety.\nDeaths and injuries caused by wind gusts\nBuller 1993 has compiled statistics for deaths and injuries caused by the wind in the United\n4\nKingdom in 1962-1993 using newspaper cuttings as the main data source. His findings are likely\nto be limited by under reporting, and the classification of injuries as major and minor is also likely\nto be affected by reporting bias, so we combine the two types here.The mean annual numbers were\n6 deaths and 144 injuries. Road transport-related accidents dominate the total number of deaths\n(280/464 or 60%), followed by accidents from building failure (184/464 or 40%).The greatest\nnumber of deaths in wind events from any one cause of direct building failure was falling chimneys\n(34), or falling chimneys, roof elements and walls (78).The two most important causes of deaths\nnot related to building failure were being blown over and subsequently hit by a vehicle (16), and\njust being blown over (22).\nIn the October 1987 and January/February 1990 windstorms, a total of 99 deaths were reported.\n57 Deaths involved vehicles with 41 deaths caused by road traffic accidents as a result of falling\ntrees. Building failures led to 13 deaths.The most important cause of reported minor and serious\ninjury was being blown over in the open, with about a third of the 2 287 reported injuries being\nattributed to this.\n139Only broad conclusions can be safely made from these simplified data, but they suggest that road\ntraffic accidents are the most important in terms of deaths and therefore possibly severe injury - as\na result of trees falling onto roads and vehicles, as well as vehicles being blown about, or colliding,\nin the wind.The major single cause of injury in individuals in the open is being blown around by\nthe wind, including into the path of traffic. Building failure, such as the collapse of chimney stacks\nand walls, are a less significant but still important cause of death and injury.\nInjury agents\nTrauma in windstorms is due to impacts on the human body from objects being displaced by the\nwind, or by the body being blown over and then being injured by impact against hard surfaces or\nby falling in front of traffic. Falls may also be from roofs or into rivers, etc. Unfortunately, few\nstudies of wind injuries in the UK have been published. On 1 February 1983 gales were\nparticularly severe in the Leeds area with gusts up to 96 mph (43 m/s) being recorded. 116 Patients\nwere treated in the two main hospitals in Leeds, which served a population of about 735 000, for\n9\ninjuries caused by the wind. Three people died, and the types of injury were analysed . The\nmajority of the accidents occurred when people were blown over whilst walking outside. Eighty-\none patients were blown over. Nine people were injured when parts of buildings collapsed. Four\npatients were injured by falling slates and twelve by other falling or flying objects, including\nwindow glass, a tree, a milk-crate and a dustbin. Four patients were injured in road accidents caused\nby the wind.The patients sustained injuries of all degrees of severity: chest crushed, head injuries,\nother fractures, shoulder dislocations, sprains, lacerations, abrasions, contusions, and eye injuries\n(Table 4.6).All age groups were equally affected.The authors concluded that many injuries could\nhave been prevented, especially if elderly people had stayed indoors for a few hours until the very\nhigh winds had abated. One hundred and four (90%) of the patients were seen at the hospitals on\n1 February, and they comprised 23 % of new patients attending.\n140Table 4.6 Injuries caused by wind (some patients sustained more than one\ninjury): Attendances at two Leeds hospitals, 1st February 1983 gales.\nInjury No. of\nattendances\nCrushed chest (multiple fractures) 1 (fatal)\nHead injuries\n(with loss of consciousness) 7 (2 fatal)\nFractured skull 1\nOther fractures 22\nFacial bones 1\nCervical spine 1\nShoulder 6\nWrist 8\nHip 2\nHand or foot 4\nDislocations 3\nSprains 9\nAnkle 6\nOther 3\nLacerations 39\nHead 27\nLimbs 12\nAbrasions 39\nHead 12\nLimbs 27\nContusions 32\nHead 13\nLimbs 14\nChest 5\nEye injuries 4\nOther injuries 3\n14110\nIn a separate study , wind-related injuries treated in two inner city London accident and\nemergency departments during January and February 1990 were analysed. 58 Patients were seen,\nof whom eight required admission to hospital.The majority of patients were either hit by flying\ndebris or falling masonry (36%), or were blown over by the wind (33%).The vast majority of the\ninjuries were sustained during daylight hours, with head injuries, limb fractures and foreign bodies\nin the eye being the most common (Table 4.7).The number of injuries resulting from falling\nmasonry, scaffolding, advertising hoardings and various loose debris was only increased on days\nwhen wind gust speeds exceeded approximately 60 knots (70 mph or 30 m/s).The authors suggest\nthat this gust speed could be used as a warning threshold for issuing advice to the population to\n9\nstay indoors . In contrast to the experience in Leeds, the overall numbers of patients attending for\ntreatment was unchanged on windy days.\nTable 4.7 Injuries caused by wind: Attendances at two inner-city London\nhospitals, January-February 1990 gales\nType of Injury Number Anatomical site Number\nof Injury\nHead injuries – no fracture 15 Head 17\nHead injuries – compound 2 Eyelid 12\nFractures 18 Lower limb 12\nForeign body in eye 13 Upper limb 9\nLacerations 9 Face 4\nSoft tissue injury 8 Chest 4\nAbrasion 4 Back 1\nOther 1 Neck 1\nA study of wind-induced accidents of road vehicles in England and Wales in the 25 January 1990\n10\nstorm confirmed the vulnerability of vehicles when being driven in wind gusts exceeding 20 m/s.\nOverturning accidents were the most common type, accounting for 47% of the total. Course-\ndeviation accidents made up 19% and accidents involving trees 16 % of the total. Sixty-six per cent\nof the accidents involved high sided lorries or vans, whilst only 27% involved cars and this number\n11\nincluded most of the accidents that were caused by collision with falling trees .\n4.5.5 Windstorm severity index\nThe potential for accidents and injury needs to be related to a wind damage scale so that we can\nmore readily examine the local intensity of storms and threshold criteria for structural damage and\nhuman trauma. Damage is caused by wind gusts (defined as lasting for three seconds) and not\naverage wind speeds, which in storms will have much lower values.There is no designated wind\nscale for temperate windstorms and here we propose that an approximation with existing severe\nweather scales may nevertheless be useful.The Beaufort scale gives wind speed from 0, meaning\ncalm, to 12 for hurricane force winds. Hurricane intensity is classified on the Saffir Simpson scale\nby categories 1-5 (minimal to catastrophic damage) according to wind speed. Tornadoes are\n142classified by the Fujita F scale of F to F .The TORRO Tornado Intensity Scale was devised in\n0 6\n3\n1972 by the UK-based Tornado and Storm Research Organization , and this picks up where the\n12\nBeaufort scale ends.The T -T part of the damage scale with the lower wind speeds as shown in\n0 4\nthe truncated version of the T-T scale in Table 4.8.The lower end of the T level (33 m/s) is the\n0 12 2\nbeginning of sustained hurricane wind speed.\nTable 4.8 The Torro Tornado Intensity scale (T–T )\n0 4\nTORRO Description of Description of Damage\nIntensity Wind speeds\n-1\nT 17–24 ms Loose light litter raised from gound-level in spirals. Tents\n0\nmarquees seriously disturbed; most exposed tiles, slates on roofs,\n(39–54 mph)\ndislodged.Twigs snapped; trail visible through crop\n-1\nT 25–32 ms Deckchairs, small plants, heavy litter made airborne; minor damage\n1\nto sheds. More serious dislodging of tiles, slates, chimney pots.\n(55–72 mph)\nWooden fences flattened. Slight damage to hedges and trees\n-1\nT 33–41 ms Heavy mobile homes displaced, light caravans blown over, garden\n2\nsheds destroyed, garage roofs torn  away, much damage to tiled roofs\n(73–92 mph)\nand chimney stacks. General damage to trees, some big branches\ntwisted or snapped off, small trees uprooted\n-1\nT 42–51 ms Mobile homes overturned/badly damaged; light caravans\n3\ndestroyed; garages, outbuildings destroyed; house roof timbers\n(93–114 mph)\nconsiderably exposed. Some bigger trees snapped or uprooted\n-1\nT 52–61 ms Mobile homes destroyed; some sheds airborne for considerable\n4\ndistances; entire roofs removed from some houses or prefabricated\n(115–136 mph)\nbuildings; roof timbers of stronger brick or stone houses\ncompletely exposed; possible collapse of gable ends. Numerous\ntrees uprooted or snapped.\nConversion factors: 1 knot is one nautical mile (1.15 statute miles or 1.85 km) per hour, or approx. 0.5m/s\nGusts in temperate windstorms are unlikely to exceed 100 knots, i.e., attain the upper end of the\nT scale (51 m/s), except by acceleration at the corners of buildings, etc. It is at wind speeds in\n3\nexcess of 70 m/s that trains could be overturned, cars lifted off the ground and thrown, and roofs\nand some walls torn off well-constructed houses: such a speed sustained in a hurricane would be\ncatastrophic and in the uncommon super-cyclone range.\nCertain gust speed thresholds for temperate windstorms are apparent. It is possible for a fit\nmotivated person to stand up against winds in the T level (30 m/s), but people could be blown\n1\nover whilst walking or cycling in gusts over 20 m/s.This wind gust speed (20 m/s) has been\nproposed above as a threshold for road traffic accidents, particularly in high-sided vehicles at risk\nof being overturned by the wind. Most building damage and injuries from falling or blown\nbuilding elements will occur in gusts exceeding 33 m/s.Tree knock-down and overturning of\ninadequately tethered mobile homes and caravans occurs when gusts exceed 45 m/s.\n143High density materials from building or wall failure\nThe main reported cause of death as a result of direct building failure has been the collapse of\nchimneys. Chimney-stacks, which can weigh several tonnes, may fall through several floors of a\nbuilding before causing death. However, most of the casualties occur outside, whatever their cause,\nas a result of falling chimney stacks and pots, falling walls of buildings, breaking windows, and\n4\noverturning caravans/mobile homes . Falling bricks and tiles can cause severe trauma, especially\nhead injury (skull fractures, cerebral contusions/haemorrhage). Lacerations would be common, and\nfractures of limbs or ribs could occur.\nFalling trees\nThese can cause multiple trauma by directly falling onto a vehicle or pedestrian as well as cause\nroad accidents by falling onto the road. Falling trees were the most important category of impacts\nassociated with deaths in the 1987 and 1990 events.\nBody displacement\nWind can blow people to the ground, against walls and posts, or into the path of oncoming traffic.\nAs mentioned above, this was the most common reason for non-building related injuries.The\nhazard is greatest where urban patterns produce local points of high wind speeds close to the\nground - especially corners of high-rise structures, in ‘piazza’ or ‘podium’ rather than narrow-\ncanyon planning. Head injuries and limb fractures would be common resulting conditions, as well\nas internal chest and abdominal injuries in the worst instances, i.e., multiple trauma.\nVehicle instability\nCars and lorries may collide as a result of being blown off course by the wind or even overturned.\nVehicles become increasingly unstable in high winds as their velocity increases, and drivers should\nbe warned to slow down in high winds. Motor and pedal cyclists can be blown into other traffic.\nMissiles\nThe velocity of a flying object is determined by the product of its density and thickness.Thus a 15\nmm plywood sheet flies at the same speed as a 1 mm corrugated iron sheet. Plywood panels, e.g.\nfrom disintegrating garden sheds, will start to fly about at wind speeds greater than 20 m/sec.\nWooden timbers commonly used in the construction industry (2 in x 4 in) will fly short distances\nin wind speeds in excess of 30 m/sec.Windows, guttering, loose canopies, street furniture, etc. may\nbe dislodged by the wind and could become flying missiles in the strongest gusts of wind. People\nin the open would risk being struck, especially on the head, as in other types of building failure.\nMiscellaneous\nFallen power lines may cause electrocution. Loss of power in cold weather will lead to people\nlooking for other sources of heating, including home heaters, which may be hazardous if they were\npreviously poorly maintained. Deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning could occur.The use of\ngas cylinders or candles could start house fires.\nIn summary, most deaths and injuries are caused as a result of people being outside at peak hours\nof a windstorm. Road traffic accidents may occur due to trees falling on cars and just driving in\nwindy conditions, and roads could consequently become blocked and traffic grid-locked.The\n144worst scenario would be when peak gusts coincided with periods of heavy traffic, e.g. during rush\nhour.Vulnerable houses and other buildings with weak roofs present a significant but lesser hazard\nfrom falling roof elements.\n4.5.6 Vulnerability\nThe vulnerability of structures and infrastructure plays a key role in a risk assessment of the impacts\nof windstorms.\nBuildings\nA study of the vulnerability of the UK building stock to windstorm was made by Cambridge\n13\nArchitectural Research .There were two important conclusions from this study.\nThe frequency of damage varies considerably according to building type, and both age and\nbuilding configuration are important.Table 4.9 shows a proposed classification of the UK\nbuilding stock, indicating relative vulnerability indices for 24 classes of building.These indices\nwere based on the relative areas and frequency of occurrence in each of the 24 classes of\nbuilding of the key vulnerable elements (chimneys, tiled roofs, windows), their propensity to\n14\ndamage based on data from the Building Research Establishment and their condition based\n15\non the English House Condition Survey .Vulnerability here refers to damage repair costs, an\nissue of special interest to the insurance industry, but it also denotes those buildings most likely\nto suffer some degree of damage to chimneys and tiles, for example.\nThe frequency of damage rises steeply with increasing wind speed according to a logarithmic\nrelationship.Thus a 5 m/s increase in wind speed from 40 m/s to 45 m/s would be expected\nto result in an increase in the numbers of damage incidents by a factor of 5.\n13\nTable 4.9 Proposed composite vulnerability indices for the UK building stock\n% Of pre 1919 1919– 1945– post 64\nstock 1945 1964\n% Of stock 26.4 19.7 21.5 32.5\nTerraced houses 28.1 1.32 1.15 0.79 0.40\nSemi-detached houses 26.7 1.54 1.32 0.93 0.49\nBungalow 23.5 2.0 1.72 1.21 0.65\nConverted flats 6.9 1.01 1.13 0.83 0.47\nLow-rise flats 12.7 0.81 0.7 0.48 0.25\nHigh-rise flats 2.0 0.49 0.42 0.29 0.17\nA notable event was the ‘Sheffield Gale’ of 1962, during which large numbers of buildings were\ndamaged over a wide area of northern England. Much of the damage appears to have been to old\nand neglected properties as reflected in the many casualties caused by chimneys falling through\n4\nroofs and by roofs themselves being blown off .\n145\nooTransport system\nMotorways can become blocked following a collision of two vehicles, or even by a single lorry\nbeing blown over. Main roads and their tributaries can be blocked by accidents and falling trees.\nClearing the accidents may be delayed because police and other emergency services are\noverwhelmed with calls from all kinds of other incidents. Railways can be brought to a standstill\nby falling overhead electric lines, trees falling across lines and wind damage to signals, as well as\npower supply problems. In the October 1987 event, large numbers of commuters were forced to\nstay overnight in London because the rail system stopped; the London Underground service in the\ncentre of the city was maintained. In cities these impacts will result in large numbers of people\ntaking to the streets to walk home or find somewhere to stay, thereby exposing themselves to the\nwind and falling building elements, and therefore a greater risk of injury. In cold weather people\ntrapped for prolonged periods in cars may suffer hypothermia.The transport of casualties and the\nacutely sick to hospital might also be hindered and endanger their lives.\nIn the October 1987 storm more than a hundred flights were cancelled from Heathrow and\nGatwick airports. Sea ferries were also disrupted.\nPower and communications\nIn the 15-16 October 1987 storm the whole of south-east England was without power between\n5\nabout 0300 and 0930 GMT: London was blacked out for the first time since the Blitz .Trees fell\nonto power lines and wind-borne debris caused short-circuits.Army helicopters were drafted in\nto aid with the identification of downed power lines. Even two weeks later some 2000 homes were\nstill without electricity.\nTelephone and power lines are carried to country and remote areas by overhead lines on utility\npoles.The lines can be damaged or brought down, and weaker poles may snap off. It can take\nseveral days to restore these services after the event when repair gangs are over stretched dealing\nwith large numbers of breakdowns. In towns and cities power transmission lines are underground\nand power supplies are less likely to be threatened, but the experience in London described above\nshould not be ignored.\n4.5.7 Risk scenario\nThe worst reasonably foreseeable scenario would be a situation during the day in which people\nwere travelling or moving about outside buildings in large numbers at the peak of a major\nwindstorm in London and south-east England.The overriding factor would be the time of day that\nthe storm peaked, with the worst time being just after people have started to leave early from work\nin the afternoon to travel home. In a city like London the traffic and rail and underground services\ncould come to a halt as a result of storm damage. Large numbers of people would congregate at\nrailway termini and similar locations causing considerable congestion. Some buildings with wide-\nspan roofs used for shelter might be vulnerable to collapse in strong winds and cause further\ncatastrophe. Flying debris would add to problems of people in the open and, as mentioned above,\nbeing blown around by the wind is a major cause of injury, particularly among the elderly.\nIn the 1987 event the return period for the maximum gust measured (90 knots) exceeded 200\n6\nyears in places. Of course, this is the return period for the exceedence of the expected wind speed\nat a point, and it does not mean that these events occur only once in every 200 years in the UK.\nIt would appear that at least some part of the UK could be affected in this way perhaps as\nfrequently as once every 10-20 years on average, though the reference windstorms of 1987 and\n6\n1990 contained gust velocities in excess of any gales in southern England in recent decades.\n1464.5.8 Risk assessment\nWe estimate in this worst reasonably foreseeable scenario that the numbers of people killed and\ninjured might be at least double that of the events in January/February 1990.As discussed already,\nabout 60% of the deaths in windstorms occur on the road or rail. An analysis of unpublished\nDepartment of the Environment,Transport and the Regions (DETR) traffic flow statistics (1993)\nindicates that the evening rush hour traffic is typically five or six times the late evening traffic, and\nthirty times the traffic counts in the small hours of the night.\nA reasonable estimate, assuming no warning was given to the population who, therefore, failed to\ntake anticipatory action, such as stay at home instead of going to work, could be 100 dead, 90\nseriously injured (mainly head injuries, limb fractures and multiple trauma in road accidents) and\nat least 400 people suffering minor injuries. But as the effect of rush hour traffic could be as high\nas a factor of five, the numbers of deaths in a worst scenario could be as high as 200. In addition,\nfailure of a large building with a weak roof, for example, could greatly add to the toll of death and\ninjury as a single catastrophic event.\nThe individual risk of being severely injured or killed in such an event in the UK is really quite\nlow (‘minimal’ or between one in a million and one in 100 000 annual risk, on the scale proposed\n12\nby the Chief Medical Officer ).The overall impacts would be greatest in densely populated areas\nsuch as London and other cities reliant on commuter transport.\nThe societal risk of, at worst, several hundred deaths in an event every 10-20 years is also small,\nbut unacceptable in a society unused to experiencing natural disasters and aware that risk reduction\nmeasures are available.\nThe duration of the peak winds in the above scenario is measured in hours rather than days, but\nthe damage impact would be greater if two or more severe windstorms occurred back to back.The\nwindy period at the beginning of 1990 had far greater impact because it featured the successive\nrecurrence of storms with damaging gusts on 25 January, 7/8 February and 26/27 February, as well\nas there being intervening spells containing widespread and persistently strong winds. Most of the\ndeaths and injuries would occur in the first storm phase, when people are first caught unawares.\n4.5.9 Measures to reduce exposure\nRisk reduction measures would need to be directed to providing timely and adequate warnings to\nthe population so that people could protect themselves from the storm impacts.The key factor in\nreducing human risk would be for the public to stay indoors during periods of high wind.This\nanalysis points to four levels of warning:\nGust speeds Groups to be advised (examples)\n20 m/s Pedestrians, cyclists, drivers of high-sided vehicles\n30 m/s Above groups + households + all drivers\n40 m/s Commuters, schools, rail companies, utilities, emergency services\n50 m/s Maximum gusts: widespread damage and disruption to population in\nimpacted areas\n147Appropriate mitigation measures would include the following:\nForecasts and warnings: at present advice is given on weather forecasts on TV and radio that\nstrong winds are likely, but no further advice is given on what to do.This contrasts with\ntornado warning systems in the USA, and an elaborate warning system in place in Hong Kong\nfor tropical cyclones which results in people going home well in advance of the peak impact\nof the cyclone.A similar system could be established in the UK to advise people to leave work\nin good time (or prevent them leaving home for work).The accuracy of forecasts and the range\nof lead times which may be available to the public between warning and being able to take\neffective evacuation measures also needs to be considered. Special traffic and rail flow systems\nmay need to be put in place to speed up what would in effect be an evacuation of commuting\nworkers from a large city.\nCommunity preparedness: people need to know what to do in strong wind events, especially\nwhen they are warned that these are imminent by meteorologists. People should be aware that\nit is quite dangerous walking outside in strong winds, that there are major hazards when\ndriving due to strong winds blowing over vehicles as well as causing trees to collapse on to\nvehicles and the roads. Travelling to work should be avoided, as should taking shelter in\nvulnerable buildings such as caravans and mobile homes, or structures with wide roof spans.\nOther measures include encouraging householders and others to inspect building elements\nvulnerable to strong winds, such as chimneys, tiles and outbuildings, scaffolding, advertising\nhoardings, as well as to be more prepared to cope with the impacts of windstorms.\n4.5.10 Implications for the National Health Service\nThe two studies of emergency department attendance in two inner city areas suggest that the\ninflux of injured patients will be manageable within existing capacity. The number of new\nattendances increased by 20% in one study with no overall increase in the other. Most injuries did\nnot require admission, but some patients with serious multiple trauma may be anticipated. Of\ncourse, storms occurring in winter may coincide with a period in which hospitals could be already\nfully stretched through an influenza epidemic, for example, when resources for acutely ill patients\ncould be put under severe strain. Power failures will not affect hospitals with emergency generators.\nAn important issue in hurricane-prone countries is the proofing of hospitals against very strong\nwinds, and audits of UK hospitals should be undertaken to ensure that their buildings and\ninfrastructure are capable of withstanding gusts exceeding 46 m/s (100 mph).Advice to ambulance\nand other emergency services drivers about safe driving speeds in storms and the hazards of falling\ntrees, etc., should also be provided. Hospital accident and emergency staff should be trained in the\neffect of high winds in causing injury and the types of injuries that may occur.\n16,17\nAddendum - a re-run of the Gale of the Century in France\nA severe windstorm (‘the storm of the century’) struck Paris and northern France at 0300 hr on\n26 December, 1999.The gales turned some of the French capital’s most elegant districts into a\ntangled mass of wood, metal, masonry and Christmas decorations, which were ripped from\ndepartment store buildings.After the night, residents stared with disbelief through broken windows\nat the trail of cars crushed under branches and hoardings.Throughout the north of the country\nroads were blocked, airports were closed and two million people were without electricity. Several\nhundred thousand people were left without telephones. Like the English storm of October 1987,\nthe meteorologists failed to predict its force - gusts of 107 mph on the outskirts of Paris - the\nstrongest since records began. Most deaths resulted from trees falling onto cars. Between the\n148\nooChamps Elysees and the Grand Palais century-old trees were toppled and statues were damaged.\nAt Montparnasse main-line station there was near hysteria when lumps of wood and metal hurled\nthrough a roof onto the waiting area.All trains were cancelled in northern France as there were\ntrees falling on lines. Seven of the city’s Metro lines had to be shut down as well as nearly all the\ncommuter rail services.Aircraft were damaged on the tarmac at Paris’s two international airports,\nOrly and Charles de Gaulle, which were both closed.\nA sense of panic in the Paris region was fuelled when the emergency phone number went down.\nAt one stage the fire service, which had been called out 1300 times in the capital, drove round\nlooking for emergencies.At least 73 people died in the worst affected areas, most of whom were\ncrushed by falling trees or masonry and other debris. Many more were injured.\nAnother major storm hit southern France the next day. Southern Britain did not entirely escape\nthe repercussions of the storms. As well as having to provide south coast flood warnings, the\n1\nEnvironment Agency was reported ominously reminding us of the sea surge risk :“We have had\nto raise the Thames Barrier on five successive nights during the past week.We probably raised it\nonly five times in total during all of the 1980s. Climate change means we are going to have to look\nat radical alternatives to the present arrangements...”\n4.5.11 Summary\nAccording to the Medium-High scenario of climate change in the UK, the overall gale frequencies\nare likely to decline in the future, though very severe summer and winter gales could increase.\nWind speed could rise by 4% in the south-east and 7% in Scotland by the 2080s.An increase in\nwind velocity of up to 10% would not present major problems from gusts to existing buildings and\nother structures, but there is likely to be a substantial increase in minor damage leading to a rise in\ninsurance claims. Increases in wind velocity over 10% could require, in the longer-term, further\nstrengthening of building regulations for roofs. Severe gales are already with us as is shown by the\nreference events in 1987 and 1990 which we have drawn on for this report.\nMost deaths in temperate windstorms occur in road traffic accidents, especially as a result of trees\nfalling onto vehicles or roads. Structural failure, such as collapsing chimneys and walls, ranks next\nas a main cause of death. Most injuries arise from being blown over in the wind with or without\nbeing subsequently struck by a vehicle.The impacts of a worst foreseeable wind on infrastructure,\nespecially power, transport and communications, have many direct and indirect consequences for\nhuman health and safety. Our analysis suggests that the threshold for injury starts at gusts of 20 m/s,\nwhen elderly people could be blown over or people on cycles blown down, and more frequent\nand serious incidents arise at gusts over 30 m/s, when everyone should be warned to stay indoors.\nGusts of over 20 m/s can also endanger high-sided vehicles, which become increasingly unstable\nthe faster they are driven.At gusts in excess of 45 m/s trees fall down and may cause fatal accidents\non roads, and falling masonry may cause deaths inside as well as outside houses.\nThe human and infrastructure impacts of future temperate windstorms warrant more detailed\ninvestigation to expand the present sparse statistical base and to inform risk reduction measures. It\nis evident from this analysis (and confirmed in the impacts of the Paris gales on 26 December 1999)\nthat inner city environments in the UK (and France) are highly vulnerable to windstorms, both in\ntheir buildings and their infrastructure.The potential for a large loss of life exists as well as for huge\ndisruption with attendant economic consequences.\n149The worst reasonably foreseeable scenario is a winter windstorm in London and south-east\nEngland that increases in intensity over the hours after 3 pm when the maximum numbers of\ncommuters would be out in the open or in cars and trains. Failure of the transport system (road\nand rail) would leave these individuals highly vulnerable to accidents and exposure to the impacts\nof gusting winds. Congested crowds of large numbers of people in buildings could be vulnerable\nto wind-induced roof collapse, and other forms of catastrophe to trains and air traffic could also\nstrike.We estimate that the overall number of deaths could be as high as 200, with hundreds of\nother people injured, several scores of these seriously.As these would occur over a wide area, the\nmanagement of the injured should not overwhelm the existing hospital services unless a major\nincident occurs or hospitals are already under stress for other reasons, such as an influenza epidemic.\nThe number of mass casualty events is hopefully likely to be few, but inner city areas are especially\nat risk. These human impacts of windstorms would be seen as foreseeable and inherently\npreventable in a modern technological society, and government could be criticised for failing to\ntake preventative action.This potential for disaster, in our view, justifies the need to consider the\nsetting up of emergency planning with advance warning systems to forecast major windstorms, and\na programme of increasing awareness and education in mitigation measures in the general\npopulation. However, climatologists using existing climate change models or past gales records\ncannot constrain the return periods of the extreme windstorms we base our work on here, and\nthese uncertainties are amongst the most important limiting factors in completing a human health\nrisk assessment.\n4.5.12 Priorities for future action and research \nFurther development of computer models to improve the capacity to predict windstorms is\nneeded.\nReview of building regulations with a view to improving the capacity of roofs and other\nvulnerable structures such as chimneys to resist very high winds is recommended.\nImproved emergency planning for severe windstorms is recommended.\nA campaign to raise public awareness of the dangers posed by very high winds and the steps\nthat can be taken to counter these effects is recommended.\n150\noooo4.5.13 References\n1.

Currently staffed by Lt Cdr Sally Roots (RNWSO) and POWPT Michelle Bowen (ARNWSO), the office remains the focal point for all aspects of women’s sport in the Royal Navy, despite the fact that the majority of RN representative teams are now centrally administered alongside their male counterparts.\n\n \n\nAt establishment level, it organises and runs a programme of events throughout the year, including Navy Cup competitions in Hockey, Netball, Football and Volleyball, which are run on a knockout basis during the term. Inter-Unit competitions generally take place on a Wednesday afternoon and events for the Summer Term 2002 will be Rounders, Outdoor Volleyball and Netball. \n\n\n\nSporting opportunities for women in the Royal Navy have never been greater than in recent years, with the majority of sports, including Football, Rugby and Cricket, now available. More ‘traditional’ female sports, such as Netball and Hockey, continue to be strongly supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The Statement of Procedures should, regardless of the policies adopted, address the making of a complaint, the processing of a complaint, the provision of support to complainants, the use of enforcement action, support in respect of the perpetrator and monitoring complaints of ASB. Additionally, any relevant procedures relating to multi-agency partnerships and professional witness schemes should also be included. \n\n\n4.3 Where ALMOs, TMOs or other housing management contractors (including PFI contractors) are managing some or all of the landlord's housing, the Statement of Procedures should make clear to residents the respective responsibilities of the local housing authority and housing management service providers in tackling ASB. \n\n\nMaking a complaint of ASB \n\n\n4.4 Information on how and to whom the initial complaint of ASB should be made should be included in the Statement of Procedures with contact details. It would also be helpful if some guidance were provided on when it might be appropriate for a complainant to contact other agencies, such as the police. \n\n\nProcessing a complaint of ASB \n\n\n4.5 Early responses to complaints and action plans agreed between the landlord and the complainant, where appropriate, can be vital to effectively deal with ASB, helping to build trust and confidence. Effectively processing a complaint of ASB gives credibility to the landlord's ASB service and assists the relationship between the complainant and the landlord. \n\n\n4.6 Landlords are encouraged to develop clear lines of communication between the complainant and the landlord. These should be established at the earliest opportunity. The contact point or points for complaints of ASB should be set out in the procedures. Ideally each complainant would have access to a named officer to discuss their case, and any changes in personnel should be communicated to the complainant as soon as possible. It is important that landlords keep a complainant informed, as far as permissible, about the progress of their case. \n\n\n4.7 The landlord should encourage the involvement of the complainant in the progress of the complaint. The Statement of Procedures could include the following: \n\n\n  \t the information and advice that will be provided to the complainant when they make a complaint; \n\t how clear lines of communication between the landlord and the complainant will be established; \n\t how the complainant will be kept informed of the progress of the case; and \n\t the role of the complainant in the determination of an action plan;\n\t what the complainant can do if they are unhappy with the service they have received. Reference should be made to internal and external complaint procedures; \n\t escort to Court; and \n\t support beyond any court proceedings. \n\n\n\nSupporting complainants \n\n\n4.8 Landlords should consider the support needs of complainants, including how best to assess and meet their needs. The methods of, and triggers for, referring complainants to external sources of support, may also be included in the Statement of Procedures with a list of the available support services. The support mechanisms provided by the landlord to the complainant may include: \n\n\n  \t risk assessment of home environment, installation of appropriate witness protection measures, alarms, new locks, panic buttons etc; \n\t access to counselling services; \n\t allocations and lettings policies that are both sympathetic to complainants and effective, where it is appropriate to do so, providing temporary and/or permanent rehousing; \n\t witness support; \n\t access to telephone and/or face-to-face interpreters; and \n\t regular visits or patrols by housing officers, community support workers or neighbourhood wardens. \n\n\n\n4.9 Other departments and agencies will be able to provide varying degrees of additional practical, specialist or emotional support and advice to complainants. This support may be as diverse as target hardening schemes, translation services or 'buddy schemes'. \n\n\nOptions available to landlords \n\n\n4.10 The Statement of Procedures should include the types of legal and non-legal actions a landlord could take and explain the circumstances in which each might be appropriate. \n\n\nThese could include, but are not limited to: \n\n\n  \t Mediation \n\t Acceptable Behaviour Contracts \n\t Anti-Social Behaviour Orders \n\t Injunctions and exclusions orders under sections 153A, 153B, 153C or 153D of the 1996 Act \n\t Injunctions under section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 \n\t In connection with any of the injunctions above, applications for powers of arrest \n\t Possession proceedings \n\t Demoted tenancies \n\t Any other legal action which could be taken with the support of the police or local authority, for example, Environmental Protection Act (1990) action or criminal prosecution. \n\n\n\n4.11 Further information on these actions as well as a collection of best practice in tackling anti-social behaviour can be found at www.together.gov.uk. Practitioners may also wish to contact the Together Actionline (0870 220 2000), which can provide advice across the range of anti-social behaviour issues. \n\n\nMonitoring ASB and the service \n\n\n4.12 Landlords are encouraged to monitor ASB and the service they provide to tackle it. This will assist the landlord to: \n\n\n  \t evaluate the effectiveness of specific ASB initiatives; \n\t identify key priorities and issues; \n\t understand the nature and location of areas where ASB is prevalent; and \n\t distinguish between different types of behaviour, which could be categorised as ASB. \n\n\n\n4.13 The Statement of Procedures should identify what internal and external monitoring of the service is carried out, if any, and the performance indicators that are used to assess the service. \n\n\n4.14 Landlords may wish to consider the following when developing monitoring mechanisms: \n\n\n  \t The current best value indicator for compliance with the Commission for Racial Equality guidance on dealing with racial harassment \n\t Appropriate local indicators as outlined in the Audit Commission's library of indicators \n\t Local Indicators developed by the landlord to measure the performance and effectiveness of the service(s) provided by them and other providers \n\t Local indicators agreed by the landlord to assist in the delivery of other strategies, for example the local Crime and Disorder Strategy. \n\n\n\nData collection \n\n\n4.15 The ODPM publication 'Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour in Mixed Tenure Areas' (March 2003) identified a number of areas where effective data collection is used, some of which are of direct relevance to a landlord: \n\n\n  \t evaluating the effectiveness or otherwise of particular initiatives; \n\t identifying key priorities and issues of concern; \n\t helping understand the nature and location of problems and hot spots; and \n\t distinguishing between different types of behaviour. \n\n\n\n4.16 The landlord's Statement should identify: \n\n\n  \t how incidents are categorised; \n\t what data will be collected; \n\t how it will be collected; and \n\t to what uses it will be put. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\tDownloadable files:\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\n     \n\n\n

Patients will be encouraged to feel able to check NHS staff have washed their hands. Patient forums will be invited to inspect four times a year, and rates of MRSA will be made easily available to everyone.\n\nIn the NHS, a Matron's Charter is being developed to strengthen cleaning teams and ensure patients' views are heard. Nurses will also receive checklists to help them assess compliance with hygiene and decontamination policies.\n\nIndependent inspection will track progress, as cleanliness contributes to the Healthcare Commission's annual star ratings. Cleanliness and infection control are also included in the new National Healthcare Standards to be monitored by the Healthcare Commission.\n\nTowards cleaner hospitals also puts MRSA at the forefront of research and learning in the NHS. Summits later in 2004 will gather together international healthcare professionals to discuss infection control.\n\n Towards cleaner hospitals and lower rates of infection: A summary of action\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning ways\n\n\n\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) report Winning ways sets out key issues and detailed guidance in seven action areas to reduce healthcare associated infection. They are:\n\n\n\n    \n        \tactive surveillance and investigation\n\treducing the infection risk from use of catheters, tubes, cannulae, instruments and other devices\n\treducing reservoirs of infection\n\thigh standards of hygiene in clinical practice\n\tprudent use of antibiotics\n\tmanagement and organisation\n\tresearch and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n Winning ways: working together to reduce healthcare associated infection in England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t            \nSecondary Navigation - links to other pages in this section\n\nCurrent section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAI key documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Infection Society (external link)\nInfection Control Nurses Association (external link)\nHealth Facilities Management Association (external link)\nAssociation of Domestic Management (external link)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t            \nAuxiliary Links\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n© Crown copyright 2004\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n    \nGlobal Tools - quick links to useful sections\n\nAbout us\n\nSite map\n\nHelp\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch this site\nThis Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The ship was alongside for the celebrations of the Entende Cordiale, an agreement of friendship between the United Kingdom and France.  While in the small picturesque town we joined the French Frigate the FS Germinal. HMS Mersey held a reception onboard where the night was enjoyed by all that attended.  This provided a great opportunity for both Navies to bond and learn about each other.  Both ships were open to visitors, which was well received by the local population.  Not only constrained to St Malo the local Anglican Church in Dinard the Eglise Anglicane de Dinard, invited an attendance at their Sunday Service where the Commanding Officer and others attended. The ship set sail leaving behind a beautiful town and some fond memories.\n\n\n\nChief of Staff Warfare to Cincfleet\n\nOn 5th October Rear Admiral D G Snelson CB Chief of Staff Warfare to CinCFleet visited the ship.  This allowed the Admiral to gain a true insight into how a River class works and the feeling from the people who work on it.  The sailors provide the Admiral with a good insight into Mersey and how they make her work.  The visit was received well by all parties involved.\n\n\n\nGuernsey\n\nRecently the ship underwent some operational continuity training with HMS Severn. With a tendency for skill fade both ships pulled out and performed well.  The training went on for a week with both ships pulling into Guernsey on completion for some down time.  This was a welcome break for the sailors as they had not only been working hard to achieve the correct standards but the weather was not kind either, with strong winds, poor visibility and rough seas all a gentle reminder to what winter can bring.   The ships visit provided a Royal Navy presence at the Charybdis/Limborne commemoration weekend where the surviving members of these war time vessels were hosted onboard Mersey for an evening reception.  During the visit the football teams of Severn and Mersey played a friendly match with squadron rivalry at stake both teams played for the win but after a lucky break from Severn the match concluded with a six – two defeat to Mersey.\n\n\n\nGrimsby\n\nThe ship recently pulled into Grimsby to aid with the Fishery enforcement Officers Course that spends a week of the course in Grimsby.  This allowed a gentle break in the patrol cycle for the sailors to enjoy a night ashore.  The visit was only for 24 hours.\n\n\n\nHull\n\nWith East Coast ports top of the agenda for our current patrol area Mersey was pleased to visit Hull for a patrol standoff.  Able to enjoy two and half days of shore time the Ships Company took no time at all in making the most of the delights that hull has to offer.\n\n\n\n04 Nov 04\n\nNearing the later part of the year and HMS Mersey has seen a successful year in her role as a Fisheries Protection Vessel.  From her performance during OST in the Spring when she went operational to October when she went through continuity training with her sister ship Severn.  The ship is now in Portsmouth for most of November when she will conduct two more patrols of the UK before the ship goes on a well-deserved Christmas leave.  From all serving on HMS Mersey we wish you a pleasant Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

Raises lots of interesting issues and points.  I have a student who is in the process of writing a fictional blog but he does have a double agenda for it - he's using it to give another life to a character in a screenplay he's written and is hoping to produce, and he's also hoping to promote a particular health issue lobby through it (I guess that's a triple agenda).  But I think the idea of over-lapping forms, each with a different agenda, is potentially very fruitful.\n\n\n\nI liked the way that in the early days of Salaam Pax a lot of the discussion around his blog was whether or not he was 'real'.  In many ways, it was great that it turned out that he was 'real', because his insights into the war in Iraq have been so revealing.  But at the same time I find it kind of... what, baffling?  that if it had turned out to be 'not real', i.e. fiction, it would have also been 'inauthentic'.

I think this business about authenticity is fascinating. I've got 'Everything Is Illuminated' by Jonathan Safran Foer sitting by my bed, and I'm told that the author writes compellingly about the Ukraine without ever having been there. \n\n\n\nThere is a cult for 'research' and factual accuracy amongst writers of fiction that (I think) comes from the fact that most writers these days have some kind of background in journalism. As I mention in my article, there a lot of journalists within the blogging community too.\n\n\n\nThere are some quite interesting threads in Grand Text Auto about the possible 'fusion' of fiction and reality in the online environment.\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\ntimw \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n-------------------------\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Wright\nDigital Writer In Residence\nInResidence Weblog\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t           \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\tReply\t???\tQuote\t???\tTop\t???\tBottom\t???\t?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTim Wright\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPosts: 394\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoined: Jul 2003\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonday February 02, 2004 10:33 AM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInteresting development this w/e. \n\n\n\nI have been contacted by the author of She's a Flight Risk pointing out errors in my article on Blog Fiction:\n\n\n\nYou wrote: \"She's A Flight Risk, for example, is by an author who purports to be on the run around the globe funded by various online share deals.

I'm sorry that my potted summary of your work annoyed you. I agree that that the reference to 'online share deals' is a misrepresentation of how you claim to finance your 'flight' and I'm happy to publish a correction in the trAce forum.\n\n\n\nThe error came from trying to condense a description of your site into one paragraph and I'm sorry that by doing so I misrepresented your story. I can assure you I have read quite a lot of your blog and there are references there to your use of initial funds to invest and speculate via a money manager:\n\n\n\n\"Busy beyond belief. So much for my portfolio's war gains. They weren't all wiped out, but it was looking like a nice little bump on Friday and looks like a smaller bump today.\"\n\n\n\n\"Talked to money managers, may have picked one and a strategy for investing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine, then we'll give you a break. If you start making big returns on this portfolio we might have to reconsider. This is a lot of risk for me and I have to spend more with your portfolio since it's so large.\" \n\n\n\nYou do also admit that you are deliberately vague about your finances, leaving your readers free to speculate about where your money comes from. So I guess there's some small excuse there for my error. I hope you can forgive me anyway. I'm not some hard-arsed journo rushing to judge you. I'm just another writer on the web trying to make sense of what I find.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of whether your work is fiction, or whether you are a 'real' person, I wasn't saying it was important for people to 'believe' in you. In fact, I suspect we rather agree about how this online storytelling malarkey might work. As you write yourself:\n\n\n\n\"I suppose from my perspective I don't really care what people think. If I say it's not fiction, then that's just part of the hoax. If I say it is, I'm just covering up to stay safe (both of these possibilities have been suggested). If I don't give details it's because this is an elaborate ruse. If I do then I'm an idiot for being so reckless (though this entire post-it-to-the-web endeavor is reckless). I can't keep everyone happy, so I'll just write- as I have been. As for you, I don't know. Just read? Love, hate, enjoy, despise... whatever suits your fancy.\"\n\n\n\nThere is therefore no obligation on my part to somehow 'check' whether your story is fiction or not (is there?). That's why your blog is so fascinating to me. It lives in the hinterland between our 'real' selves and our imaginative selves - and it's often the space where good examples of digital (or interactive) literature can be found.\n\n\n\nI am of course intrigued by the idea that there is now an interaction between the writer (you) and the reader (me) that is happening outside the blog itself. (And I notice BTW that you had some difficulty with how the 'comment' function/reader interaction can disrupt the storyteller's flow - or were you simply playing with that idea?)\n\n\n\nI guess this brief exchange DOES change how 'believable' I take you to be. But it doesn't prove anything (does it?) about whether your story is a work of fiction or not. And I'm not sure the Esquire article gets any further than I have in unravelling that question.\n\n\n\nThanks for getting in touch. I will post a correction tomorrow in the forum.

At first I babbled about this online because it was new to me.  That was a mistake.\n\n\n\nAs for your summary, I just didn't want to be cast as stealing from widows and orphans or something.  \"Online share deals\" is just slightly north of \"internet porn baroness.\"\n\n\n\n>You do also admit that you are deliberately vague about your finances,\n\n\n\n\n\nSo stipulated.\n\n\n\n>leaving your readers free to speculate about where your money comes \n\n>from.\n\n\n\nCertain legal issues mandate that, I'm afraid.\n\n\n\n>So I guess there's some small excuse there for my error.

I stuck with it for a long time- as long as I could.  Then I just got tired of being called a \"c**t\"  (Excuse me.  I do so hate that word even in type but it gets the point across) and being the \"host\" to the parasites that felt they were owed a public forum to vent their nastiness.  When Moveable Type 3.0 comes out with registration for comments I will likely put them back up.\n\n\n\n>And I'm not sure the Esquire article gets any further\n\n>than I have in unravelling that question.\n\n\n\nJohn and I had a very strict understanding about what could be printed and what couldn't.  He wouldn't let me at raw copy per se (he is a journalist) but we agreed ahead of time that many things were off-limits and could not show up in print.  That included any specifics about my identity or anything that might reveal where I was.  That's a lot of detail that had to be yanked.  John insisted on some rather substantial documentation before we spoke, however.  He didn't want to go on record unless he himself was satisfied.

The game is now played every time the Ship comes alongside in port and contributes a considerable income for the Ship’s principle charity, Demelza House childrens’ hospice in the County of Kent.\n\n\n\nThe game is a cross between Bingo and Roulette.  Both shafts are painted with numbers from 0 to 9 around their rim.  Arrows attached to a fixed point above the shaft are then used to determine the winning numbers as the shaft comes to rest.  Reading the numbers on both shafts naturally generates a random figure between 00 and 99.\n\n\n\nNumbers are sold from the Ship’s Control Centre the night before entering a port and all members of the Ship’s Company have the opportunity to purchase a number for the price of one English Pound. The Captain, Commander Simon Hardern, has a standing number 4 (the age of his son - for the next the eight months at least).  If they have been lucky enough to pick the number indicted by the shafts then they receive half of the monies collected, with the other half being donated to Charity.\n\n\n\nWhilst manoeuvring alongside a berth, shafts may be stopped several times.  However, winning numbers are never read until the order “Finished With Main Engines” has been passed from the Bridge.  Chief Petty Officer Mick Bland, the Head of the Propulsion Section on board, then has the honour of reading the numbers and passing them to the Marine Engineer Officer, Lieutenant Commander Ned Kelly, who declares the winner from the list of numbers purchased.\n\n\n\nIt is normal for all 100 numbers to be sold and there have been winners in every Department on board - apart from the Captain that is - despite him doing all the hard work of bringing the Ship alongside!  This activity has generated over £300 in the two months since it started, and looks set to provide a continued source of entertainment, and charitable income, for some time to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The Squadron was initially attached to the Carrier HMS Courageous for Spotter-Reconnaissance duties. The Squadron re-equipped in turn with Fairey Seals and Blackburn Sharks before receiving the Fairey Swordfish in the autumn of 1937. The Squadron embarked in HMS Ark Royal in November 1938 and continued operating her Swordfish from there for the next three years.\n\n\n\nShortly after the beginning of the Second World War it became clear that the Carriers were too vulnerable to operate their aircraft solely in the anti-submarine role and so the Squadron was re-tasked to undertake the roles of surface search and torpedo-attack.     Ark Royal, with 820 embarked, spent the first half of 1940 in the Atlantic on convoy protection duties before going north in support of the Narvik operation.  In June they moved to the Mediterranean operating against both the French and Italian fleets and escorting convoys to and from Malta.\n\n\n\n820 Squadron played a prominent part in the search for, and destruction of, the German battleship Bismarck. The ship's steering gear was disabled by torpedoes delivered by Squadron aircraft; thus allowing our surface forces to intercept, engage and sink her. Later in 1941 the Squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Albacores and early in 1942 embarked in HMS Formidable for service in the Indian Ocean. In November 1942, 820 aircraft supported the Allied landings in North Africa and in 1943 operated in support of the landings in Sicily and Salerno. Later in November 1943 the Squadron sank a U-boat operating in the Mediterranean. \n\n\n\nOn return to the UK in early 1944, 820 embarked in HMS Idefatigable with 12 new Barracuda aircraft and sailed for Norway where the Squadron took part in the attacks against the Tirpitz. Towards the end of the year the Squadron again re-equipped, this time with Grumman Avengers, and re-embarked in Indefatigable to sail for the Far East. In early 1946 the Squadron returned home and in March they disbanded. \n\n\n\nIn July 1951 the Squadron re-formed equipped with the Fairey Firefly V flying again in the anti-submarine role. During 1952 and 1953, 820 embarked in turn in HMS Indomitable and HMS Theseus and spent considerable time exercising in the Mediterranean. After subsequent re-conversion to the Grumman Avenger and then to the Fairey Gannet MK1 the Squadron operated during 1954 to 1956 with both HMS Centaur and HMS Bulwark. 820 were again disbanded on 2 December 1957 only to re-form on the same day at HMS Vernon; this time as a Helicopter Squadron equipped with the Westland Whirlwind MK VII. The Squadron embarked in HMS Hermes in May 1958 flying in the anti-submarine and commando role and remained there until October 1960 when the Squadron was again disbanded.\n\n \n\nRe-formed in 1964 with the Westland Wessex MK1, 820 became HMS Eagle's anti-submarine squadron. After five years the Wessex MK1 was replaced by the MK3, the first autonomous equipped anti-submarine helicopter in the Royal Navy. \n\n\n\nIn 1969 the Squadron transferred to the Tiger Class Helicopter Cruiser HMS Blake and remained with her until the ship was sent for disposal in 1979. The Wessex were replaced by the superior Westland Sea King MK1 in December 1972 and these were in turn replaced by the MK2 and in December 1980 by the Sea King MK5. \n\n\n\nIn April 1982 the Squadron embarked in HMS Invincible and sailed for the South Atlantic and the subsequent Falklands war. During the conflict the Squadron successfully flew over 4700 hours in a variety of roles. HMS Invincible spent 166 days continuously at sea during this time, a world record for continuous Carrier operations. \n\nSince its return from the South Atlantic the Squadron has been involved in exercises with ships and aircraft of other NATO countries. At the end of 1985 the Squadron ended its connection with HMS Invincible and formed part of the Air Group on board HMS Ark Royal. \n\n\n\nIn February 1990 the Squadron took delivery of the much improved, Sea King MK6 with its integrated Sonar systems. In January 1993, the Squadron was recalled from leave and sent, at short notice, to support the British contingent of UN forces in Bosnia (Operation Grapple); embarking in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships Fort Grange and Olwen. The Primary Role of the Squadron switched to logistical support, ferrying men and supplies around the Adriatic. During the deployment, Squadron aircraft carried out in excess of 1,400 deck landings and flew over 1,900 hours in support of the task. \n\n\n\nIn 1994 the Squadron was once again deployed to the Adriatic in support of the continuing Operations in Bosnia; this time embarked in HMS Ark Royal. The Squadron's role continued to be that of logistical support with an intense schedule of numerous stores deliveries, personnel transfers and supply operations. On return to the UK, and with the de-commissioning of Ark Royal, the Squadron re-deployed on to HMS Illustrious. 1996 saw the Squadron in the eastern Atlantic taking part in major exercises followed by visits to America. In early 1997 they embarked, once again in Illustrious for a round the world deployment as part of Ocean Wave 97. \n\n\n\nA trip to the Gulf, in support of Operation Bolton, started off 1998, which ended with the Squadron returning to its base in Cornwall whilst HMS Illustrious underwent a major refit including the removal of her Sea Dart missile system in order to increase the deck space for aircraft operations. Far from being unemployed, 820 Squadron conducted further valuable Anti-Submarine Warfare Training embarked in Royal Fleet Auxiliaries Fort Victoria, Fort George, Olwen and Olna as well as the Dutch ship Amsterdam. Two aircraft were also detached to the underwater ranges in the Bahamas for weapon trials. 1999 saw the Squadron re-embarked on HMS Illustrious participating in various exercises both in UK waters and further afield.  During operational patrols in the Gulf in 2000 the Squadron was re-tasked to provide humanitarian aid in Mozambique and for Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone. \n\n\n\nUpto the end of 2003, another extremely busy year for 820 NAS, a look back over the previous 12 months demonstrates the varied and intensive activity undertaken by a modern Front line ASW Squadron.\n\n\n\nThe planned reprofiling of 820 NAS from Sea King Mk VI to Merlin HM Mk I on 1 January 2002 was postponed for a total of 9 months due to the uncertain military requirement post 11 September 2001.  The Sea King element of the Squadron contributed to Operation Telic in the Arabian Gulf, primarily in the Support Helicopter role embarked in RFAs Argus and Fort Austin and subsequently in HMS Ark Royal.  \n\n\n\nBack in the UK, throughout this period, a small Merlin Formation Cell maintained the Fleet focus on aircraft update for 820 NAS, providing Merlin aircraft support to HMS Invincible as she emerged from a lengthy refit period, having received the enhancements required to embark and sustain deployed Merlins.  This dual aircraft type operation was facilitated by operating Merlins under the Flight Safety and Air Engineering umbrella of 824 NAS, necessary prior to achieving the independent operations clearance attained by Performance Assessment and Rededication programmed for late 2003.\n\n\n\nA total of four embarked periods were completed by the Merlin contingent, culminating in the Operational Readiness Inspection for Invincible as she progressed towards Fleet Flag Ship and Ready Carrier status, where Merlin capability and versatility was a key enabler.\n\n\n\nThe completion of Sea King operations Post Telic and the aircraft type ‘reprofiling’ to Merlin was marked in style with a Sea King farewell ‘fly-by’ followed by a formal evening dinner attended by past, present and future Squadron members, spanning several decades of Squadron history.\n\n\n\nAfter Summer Leave, the formal standing-up of 820 NAS as a Merlin Squadron took place on 1 September 2003, with the initial focus centring on personnel joining and induction, as well as ensuring squadron infrastructure was fully compliant with Merlin operations.\n\n\n\nA very successful detachment to Kiel was conducted during November, where close liaison and co-operation with the German submarine U-Boat ‘U25’ greatly enhanced the Squadron’s primary role capability and forged good relationships for future training opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe final focus for the year was to successfully achieve independent operations status by completing the Squadron Performance Assessment, which was followed by the Squadron Rededication ceremony on 5 December.  \n\n\n\nDuring February 2004 the Squadron embarked in RFA Fort George, providing the ASW and ASuW assets required for JMC 041.  This was the final workup exercise prior to 820 NAS assuming R2 front-line Squadron status.\n\n\n\nThe Squadron looks forward to Easter leave which is followed by embarkation in RFA Fort George for Aurora 2004 and operation Rapid Alliance, which will take place in America returning mid July before Summer leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

Each chart assists the mariner by graphically representing the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe depth of water from the sea surface to ocean floor\n\n\n\n\tTidal information to allow the mariner to adjust the depths to the state of the tide.\n\n\n\n\tDangerous underwater obstructions such as wrecks, cables and pipelines.\n\n\n\n\tPosition of the coastline or ice fronts.\n\n\n\n\tPositional information in the form of a grid and magnetic compass.  The former allows the mariner to plot the ships current position by latitude and longitude, and the latter allows the mariner to plot the ships direction and course.\n\n\n\n\tNavigational aids such as lighthouses, beacons and buoys.  The chart provides the position of these structures (relative to the aforementioned grid), the light and radar emitting characteristics, colour, shape and where available their name.\n\n\n\n\tAnchorage areas, restricted areas and traffic separation schemes.\n\n\n\n\tTopographic information that would be a useful reference to the mariner.  Examples would include church spires, radio masts, vertical cliff faces and heights of coastal hills and mountains.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the roles at the UKHO is as a cartographer maintaining the existing chart coverage, and producing new chart coverage, of the Falklands Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\n\n\nDue to its outstanding natural beauty, remoteness and its abundance of wildlife the southern ocean, its islands and the Antarctic continent have become the subject of increased levels of tourism over recent years.  The tourists travel to these areas by an ever increasing number of cruise ships, some of which have the capability to carry upwards of 1000 passengers.  With the combination of the amount of vessel traffic, limited rescue facilities and the fragile nature of the environment it is imperative that the navigational charts of the area aids safe and informed navigation.\n\n\n\nEach year the RN and the UKHO decide on which geographical areas require surveying during the following season.  This is usually decided by looking at recent tourism statistics collated by the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), the work of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and defence / FCO requirements.  Once an area to be surveyed has been decided upon HMS Endurance is issued with a ‘Hydrographic Instruction’ which sets out the geographical limits of the survey and details on how the area should be surveyed.\n\n\n\nHMS Endurance is equipped with a single beam echo sounder, as are her two small motor boats the James Caird and the Nimrod.  When surveying HMS Endurance undertakes the deep water surveying, while the two smaller boats survey the bays and harbours.  This provides me at the UKHO with one of my only sources of large areas of accurate depth information in the Southern Ocean.  In addition to her survey capabilities HMS Endurance carries 2 lynx helicopters which are equipped with cameras to allow them to take vertical aerial photographs of the coastline and offshore islands.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of the season all this information is sent in digital format to the UKHO where it is processed and analysed.  Both the survey work and the aerial photographs are compared against what is currently shown on the published navigational chart.  More often than not, this reveals certain differences that the mariner should be made aware of.  The UKHO has various ways of providing the mariner with this information.  Firstly, if the survey has revealed something of a very serious nature it will be issued as a Radio Navigational Warning.  This is a radio message that can be sent to vessels in the area of the danger alerting them to it immediately.  Secondly, less serious dangers are issued as Notice to Mariners every week by the UKHO, both in paper format as well as on our website www.UKHO.gov.uk.  Finally the survey information is included in either a new edition of an existing chart, or alternatively an entirely new chart is generated.\n\n\n\nThis current season HMS Endurance has carried out some valuable survey work and aerial photography around South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula which will enhance the existing chart coverage of the area.  Due to my work at the UKHO I have been lucky enough to be invited on board HMS Endurance for her final work period down towards Halley Research base in the Weddell Sea to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula.  This provides me with a unique opportunity to experience the work of a large survey vessel ‘at the sharp end’,  helping to process the data that she has collected, which I will eventually include on the charts when I return to Taunton.  Another valuable experience that I have gained is being able to witness the navigational charts in use up on the ship’s bridge, and the reliability that is placed upon them.\n\n\n\nThe main task of this work period was to liaise with the BAS supply vessel RRS Ernest Shackleton and create a temporary aviation fuel depot site on the Antarctic mainland, from where the BAS fixed wing aircraft could move the fuel onto various permanent Antarctic bases around the continent.  HMS Endurance supplied her two lynx helicopters for the operation enabling the movement of the barrels from RRS Ernest Shackleton to the temporary ‘skiway’ on the mainland.  I was invited to be part of the shore party on the first day of the depot laying.  I was flown ashore by helicopter and joined the permanent shore party where our task was to unload the barrels from the helicopters under slung carrying net, and to assist with the transfer of the fuel barrels to the BAS temporary skiway and ultimately on board their Twin Otter aircraft.  This proved quite a demanding task in temperatures of -15C combined with the weight of the barrels and the soft underfoot conditions, but it was a most unique and enjoyable experience nonetheless.\n\n\n\nNow that the main task of the current work period is completed, there is still a lot to achieve as we have to recover BAS personnel and survey equipment from James Ross Island before finally returning to the Falkland Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

This site provides a rich and\n        well-illustrated source of information about Antarctica, The Antarctic\n        Treaty and living and working there. HMS Endurance supports BAS Field\n        Scientists in and around South Georgia and Antarctica using the ship,\n        her helicopters and her boats. Click on www.antarctica.ac.uk\n\n \n\t\n        The\n        United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO)\n\n \n        The UKHO is based in Taunton. This is the world-renowned centre for the\n        production of Admiralty Charts and associated navigation products. HMS\n        Endurance’s survey tasking, known as Hydrographic Instructions or\n        HI’s, are set by the UKHO and she renders her surveys to the National\n        Hydrographer who is based here.

The boat is preserved now in Dulwich College\n        which is his old school in South London. The boat is named after Sir\n        James Key Caird, a Dundee jute manufacturer and philanthropist, whose\n        generous gift financed the original Endurance expedition. Today, HMS\n        Endurance carries a Survey Motor Boat named James Caird, and other boats\n        named Stancomb Wills and Dudley Docker which were also boat names in the\n        original Endurance. Our other Survey Motor Boat is called Nimrod which\n        also has an association with Shackleton and we have yet another boat -\n        The 'Captain's Boat' called Eddie Shackleton. HMS Endurance’s links\n        with Shackleton are also apparent in the ship's motto is that of the\n        Shackleton family - 'By Endurance we conquer'.\n\n        The James Caird Society, established in 1994, is the only\n        institution that exists to preserve the memory, and commend the\n        outstanding qualities of leadership associated with the name of Sir\n        Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922).\n\n        Click on: www.dulwich.org.uk\n        \n\n \n\t\n        South\n        Georgia\n\n        \n        HMS Endurance assisted the Government of South Georgia and the Sandwich\n        Islands with the production of a website that was constructed by a team\n        from Dundee University under a project entitled ‘Atlantis’. This is\n        an informative and lavishly illustrated site all about South Georgia,\n        its whaling history of the past, and the abundant wildlife that lives\n        there today. It is an island just 120 miles by 30 mile with a 9000-foot\n        mountain range along its spine, yet it is home to 20 million penguins,\n        12 million seabirds and 500,000seals.

She also carries out survey work and support to\n        the Falklands Islands Government during these periods.

The main focus has been recovering and enhancing the Ship’s Operational Capability following our return from the Gulf in December.  This has been a multi-stranded effort which has encompassed training, a large engineering effort and, not least, a chance for the Ship’s Company to take leave and spend some time with their families.\n\n\n\nPrior to Easter leave HMS Sutherland undertook an intensive Fleet Time Support Period when, supported by SFM and DML, she carried out a substantial engineering work package to ensure the Ship is materially ready to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks leave to recharge the batteries was followed by a few days of recovery trials and an intensive training period where the Ship’s Company was put through it’s paces by teams from Flag Officer Sea Training’s organisation.  Sutherland acquitted herself well and proved that she was ready to embark on the important AURORA 04 deployment as part of the UK’s Joint Rapid Reaction Force.\n\n\n\nSutherland deploys on early May 04 to rendezvous with the Amphibious Assault Ship, HMS Albion.  As part of the UK’s Amphibious Task Force she will head across the Atlantic to take part in Exercise RAPID ALLIANCE.  This exercise is a vast amphibious exercise involving forces from the UK, USA, Germany, Canada and Holland.  Whilst on the other side of “The Pond” Sutherland will visit Norfolk (Virginia), Fort Lauderdale, Key West and New Orleans before returning to Devonport in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Crown Copyright 2004.

It has a temperate climate with two rainy seasons (March to May; October to December). Official languages are French, English and Kinyarwanda. Christianity is the majority religion. \n\n\nHISTORY\n\n\nRecent History\n\n\nRwandan society traditionally has been portrayed as consisting of three groups, Hutu (84%), Tutsi (15%), and Twa (only 1%). Historically Hutus were numerically stronger, but Tutsi formed the governing class. Rwanda gained independence from Belgian in 1962, and was subsequently ruled by Hutu-dominated governments. From 1972 to 1994, Rwanda was ruled by a one-party system under Hutu President Habyarimana. The Tutsis, many of whom fled Rwanda after widespread massacres in 1959, were excluded from power. Massacres continued throughout the 1960s and Tutsis continued to be excluded. Some gathered in Uganda where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its armed wing, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). \n\n\nAfter 15 years of relative calm, ethnic animosity increased in October 1990, when the RPA invaded the northeast of Rwanda from Uganda, with the objective of restoring democracy. They were halted by the national Forces Armees Rwandaises (FAR). Stalemate ensued. Regional states encouraged President Habyarimana to agree to a new power-sharing settlement, which he signed in Arusha (Tanzania) in April 1994. As he flew back to Kigali on 6 April, his plane was shot down. This was the signal for the genocide to start. Roadblocks were quickly erected and a full-scale programme of genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus began. The extremists were supported by Hutu peasants, incited to kill by ethnic propaganda. \n\n\nThe RPA launched a major offensive to drive out the FAR and end the genocide. The RPA’s first offensive was halted by a coalition of FAR and Zairean troops. The RPA regrouped. By 4 July when they reached Kigali around 800,000 people had been murdered, and over 1 million refugees and perpetrators had fled. This was the largest organised genocide since the Second World War.\n\n\nFollowing the capture of Kigali on 4 July 1994, the RPF formed a Government of National Unity based on the power-sharing agreement reached in Arusha, but excluding those parties that had planned the genocide. Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, was appointed President, with Paul Kagame (the Commander of the RPA), a Tutsi, as his deputy. Although the RPF had a minority of Cabinet seats and Assembly places, they dominated the government's policies. Following the resignation of President Bizimungu in March 2000, Paul Kagame became President of Rwanda on 6 April.\n\n\nAttacks on Rwanda, particularly the northwest, by FAR and those responsible for the perpetration of the genocide, the Interahamwe continued from eastern Zaire. The Government of Rwanda called on the international community to disarm the ex-FAR and Interahamwe, but no action was taken. \n\nIn late 1996, the RPA backed a rebellion in eastern Zaire, which destroyed the refugee camps and resulted in the overthrow of the former Zairean regime of Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997. After some weeks over a million refugees returned to Rwanda. Many ex-FAR and Interahamwe escaped and remained in Zaire.\n\n\nBy August 1998, an upsurge in attacks on north-western Rwanda by FAR/Interahamwe forces and continuing insecurity on Rwanda’s western border led Rwanda, initially in coalition with Uganda, again to back a rebellion in eastern DRC. The fighting involved DRC forces and their Zimbabwean, Chadian, Angolan and Namibian allies on one side and rebels supported by Uganda and Rwanda on the other. By the time a cease-fire agreement was signed in Lusaka (Zambia) in autumn 1999, the rebels controlled large areas in the north and east.  Little progress was made on implementing the Lusaka Agreement, and in mid-2002 South African President Mbeki, in his capacity as African Union chair, felt compelled to broker a new agreement between the DRC and Rwanda. \n\nThe Pretoria Accord was signed on 30 July 2002, and provided for Rwandan withdrawal of its troops from the DRC, and the DRC Government to stop all support for the ex-FAR/Interahamwe and to facilitate their disarmament, demobilisation and repatriation. Rwandan forces completed their withdrawal ahead of schedule on 5 October 2002, although there have been continued allegations that certain Rwandan elements had remained. Equally, despite some ad hoc repatriation of foreign armed groups, the ex-FAR/Interahamwe continued to organise militarily in DRC with the support of elements of the Kinshasa government.\n\nThe current Rwandan Government avoids use of ethnic labels, and has argued that divisions within Rwandan society, where the population shares a common language, religion and lifestyle, is not ‘ethnic’ but the result of a colonial divide-and-rule policy perpetuated by previous post independence single-party governments. Since 1996, categorisation by ethnic group no longer appears on Rwandan citizens’ compulsory identity cards.   \n\n\nPOLITICS\n\nRwanda held a referendum on 26 May 2003 on a new Constitution. This was subsequently adopted by Parliament. Presidential and parliamentary elections followed in August and September 2003. Paul Kagame was re-elected President with 95% of the vote. Although international observers reported some irregularities in the electoral process, voting was generally well-run and orderly. \n\n\nInternational Tribunal/Judicial System\n\n\nThe United Nations Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 1994. Its role is to investigate the Rwandan genocide and indict and prosecute those who bear the greatest responsibility for acts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is based in Arusha, Tanzania. ICTR have been successful in tracking, arresting and extraditing indicted suspects, although the pace of the trials has been slow. The detention centre at Arusha is highly secure, modern and well designed. \n\n\nICTR handed down its first verdict on 2 September 1998, when Jean-Paul Akayesu, former mayor of Taba Commune, was found guilty of Genocide, Direct and Public Incitement to Commit Genocide and Crimes against Humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment. The ICTR has now convicted 23 people. In October 2003 the ICTR presented its completion strategy to the UN. This foresees completing of all investigations by the end of 2004, and the eventual winding up of ICTR in 2010. \n\n\nHowever ICTR only deals with the main perpetrators of the genocide. Around 100,000 detainees are in prisons in Rwanda. The Rwandan Government will not countenance mass amnesty for those suspected of involvement in the genocide, but the numbers in detention are beyond its capability to deal with through the conventional judicial process. The Government therefore adapted a traditional form of justice – gacaca – to deal with certain categories of crime related to the genocide. International observers, including human rights organisations, have criticised the lack of legal representation for the defendants and over-crowded prison conditions.  40,000 prisoners have been released in advance of the gacaca process as they had confessed to their crimes. Following a successful pilot, gacaca is being rolled out countrywide.\n\n\nThe UK has provided voluntary assistance to ICTR, including financial and human resources in addition to our UN assessed contribution. The international community is also providing assistance to alleviate prison conditions, and to rebuild the judiciary in Rwanda. \n\n\nECONOMY\n\n\nBasic Economic Facts \n\n\nGDP: US$ 1.7 bn (2002)\n\nGDP Growth: 3.5% (2003 est)\n\nInflation: 5.5% (2002 est)\n\nMajor Exports: Coffee, tea, coltan, cassiterite\n\nMajor Trading Partners: Exports – Germany (17.7%), Pakistan (7.4%). Imports – Kenya, Belgium, US, Japan\n\nExchange Rate: Rwanda Franc 1018 = £1 (August 2004)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK Trade & Investment Country Profile: Rwanda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\n\nRwanda's Relations with Neighbours\n\n\nRelations between Rwanda and Uganda are improving. The UK has facilitated trilateral meetings between Presidents Kagame and Museveni and the Secretary of State for International Development, most recently held on 29 January 2004. \n\n\n\nRwanda's involvement in the DRC conflict damaged its relations with the Kinshasa government. Despite numerous meetings and agreement to improve bilateral relations, these remain strained, with accusations from both sides that the measures agreed to at Pretoria in 2002 have not been adhered to. Relations hit a low point during May and June 2004 when the DRC accused Rwanda of backing rebels who briefly took control of the Congolese town of Bukavu. UN forces on the ground could neither confirm nor deny this. Rwanda has taken an active role in its participation at the African Union. Rwanda deployed 150 troops to protect the African Union’s monitoring mission in Darfur, Sudan on 15 August.\n\n\nRWANDA'S RELATIONS WITH THE UK \n\nDiplomatic Representation\n\nUK representation in Rwanda\n\nRwandan representation in the UK\n\nThe first Rwandan Embassy in Britain was established in 1995. A British Embassy was also established in Rwanda at the same time. \n\n\nUK Development Assistance\n\n\nThe UK is the largest bilateral donor in Rwanda. In 1999 we made a ten-year commitment to a development programme. In financial year 2003/2004 the UK provided £37 million and in financial year 2004/2005 will provide £43m. A Memorandum of Understanding between Rwanda and the UK was signed in January 2004 which reaffirmed our commitment to Rwanda’s redevelopment. \n\nTrade and Investment with the UK\n\n\nRwanda is a country offering few trade opportunities for UK companies. There are some mineral resources, notably methane gas, but exploitation is costly. Rwanda is trying to help increase commercial opportunities and is committed to a privatisation programme of the following state-owned service enterprises: telecommunications, water and electricity, gas, transport and mining. There could be limited opportunities for UK companies here. UK exports to Rwanda in 2003 were £3.2 million, with UK imports from Rwanda in the same year totalling £ 0.25 million.\n\n\n\nRecent Visits \n\n\nOutward: Jack Straw, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (January 2002), Hilary Benn, Secretary of State for International Development (April 2004) and Chris Mullin, Minister for Africa (June 2004).\n\n\nInward: President Paul Kagame (March 2003, May 2003, January 2004), Dr Charles Murigande, Foreign Minister (May 2003), Prime Minister Makuza (November 2003). \n\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\n\nWhile abuses continue to be reported, progress is being made in raising awareness of human rights. Many NGOs continue to focus on education and reconciliation in the wake of the genocide. \n\n\nThe UN Human Rights Field Office in Rwanda operated until July 1998, when the Rwandan authorities suspended its activities. The Government has since established a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and a National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC). \n\n\nSANCTIONS\n\n\nUN Security Council resolutions 918 (1994), 997 (1995) and 1011 (1995) impose restrictions on the sale or supply of arms and related material to Rwanda and also to persons in States neighbouring Rwanda (DRC, Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi) when the goods in question are intended for use in Rwanda. To implement these measures the United Nations Arms Embargoes Orders 1993-1998, as amended by the United Nations (Sanctions) (Amendment) Order 2000, set out the licensing requirements in the UK in relation to such sale or supply. Corresponding Orders exist for the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. \n\n\n\nTRAVEL\n\nTravel Advice: Rwanda\n\nLast updated - 18 August 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

During the day Fran can be found in St Budeaux, where she is a primary school teacher.\n\n\n\nAt the Presentation of the Sovereign’s Colour to the Royal Naval Reserve, which took place at Horse Guards Parade in London on 17th May 2003, Fran had the honour of forming part of the escort to the Sovereign’s Colour.  Before the ceremony, Fran said “I spent much of my childhood in London; my father was in the Army and I watched numerous ceremonial parades on Horse Guards, but I never expected to be in one myself – let alone playing a major part such as this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Crown Copyright 2004.

I miss my family very much when I’m on deployment in HMS Endurance.\n\n\n\nI work as a Watch Chief on 212 Flight operating two Lynx helicopters. They both have red noses and doors to make them easy to see against the ice.\n\n\n\nThis season will be my sixth season in Antarctica; it is an amazing place full of the most wonderful scenery and wildlife. I love watching all the different kinds of penguins which live in Antarctica and South Georgia. Seeing whales in the wild is pretty special too.\n\n\n\nI spend a lot of time flying to different parts of Antarctica where I sometimes work ashore organizing loads and passengers for helicopter flights back to the ship or to some of the British Antarctic Survey Bases.\n\n\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing my family in Cape Town, South Africa when the ship visits there on the way home next year. I also can’t wait to play some golf when I get some time off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The reality is, however, that there will always be\nunscrupulous operators who will put profit before the welfare of the public.\nThe Government should take the lead and give clear guidelines.\n2 How far is alcohol misuse a matter of individual responsibility and when does\nGovernment have a responsibility to intervene, whether through services, legislation\nor persuasion?\nAlcohol in moderation can be medically beneficial and allow people to enjoy leisure\npursuits, but alcohol in excess can lead to health problems, poor performance at work and\nabsenteeism and can be a catalyst for committing criminal offences.  Whilst to some extent\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docindividuals must take responsibility for their own actions, as with all things in life,\nguidelines must be given to curb excessive use of alcohol.\n3 How can we strike a balance between individual and community rights and choices?\nAlcohol is a drug sold under licence.  The sale and distribution must be carefully monitored\nto protect the rights of all persons, not just the minority.  Safe drinking areas on premises\nshould be encouraged so that it can be pleasant for those drinking without adversely\nimpacting on the local community.\n4 What are the respective roles and responsibilities of consumers, voluntary groups,\ncommercial interest and others?\nEveryone involved in the drinks industry, either as customers or suppliers, have a\nresponsibility to ensure that alcohol can be ‘used’ and not ‘abused’.  It is only the minority of\npeople who cause problems for everyone and these individuals must be targeted by\nencouraging (if necessary by legislation) well run premises where alcohol abuse will not be\ntolerated.\n5 What principles should underpin a national alcohol harm reduction strategy?\n(i) Individual rights should be protected, but this should not affect other peoples quality of\nlife.\n(ii) There must be partnerships and a multi-agency approach to tackling licensing issues.\n(iii) Licensees and operators must be given clear guidelines\n(iv) Drink brands/labels specifically targeting the young and vulnerable (underage) should\nbe stopped.\nTHE CULTURE AND BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES AROUND ALCOHOL USE\nAND MISUSE\n6 How do you define alcohol misuse?  What factors do you take into account?\nAlcohol is misused when it has a detrimental effect on an individual or the impact of that\nmisuse affects the quality of life for other people.  Factors to be taken into account include\naffect on health, impact on other people, impact on family life, anti-social and unreasonable\nbehaviour and the link between alcohol and violent criminal offences.\n7 What drinking patterns should an alcohol harm reduction strategy seek to affect?  How\nsusceptible are such patterns to change?  Where should Government concentrate its\nefforts in prevention?\nBinge drinking and drinking with the aim of getting drunk.  Despite numerous initiatives,\nthese patterns continue to be a cause for concern and the Government should concentrate its\nefforts in educating young people with particular emphasis in health and the consequences of\nalcohol misuse.\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.doc8 Is there a relationship between trends in drinking and wider social change – eg the\nspread of higher education, changes in workplace culture, later marriage and/or family\nformation?  Where does this suggest we need to focus attention in influencing\nbehaviour?\nSocial standards have changed and this, together with more prosperity in the Country, can\nencourage drinking trends.  Young people, at present, have more spare money than anytime in\nhistory and with the spending culture in the Country, operators are vying for their trade.  This\nincludes the alcohol industry who, through promotions and venues, are targeting young\npeople.  We need to focus our attention to educating young people so that they are more\naware of the impact of alcohol and are encouraged to take a mature approach in considering\ntheir drinking habits.\nSchemes such as ‘alcohol referral schemes’ should be made more widely available to target\nhardened drinkers who commit criminal offences.  Tackle the underlying problem is the way\nforward but these schemes need financing.\n9  One group we need to focus on specifically is young people where the evidence suggests a\nrise in  consumption, particularly young women.  Are there other groups we should be\nfocusing on?  For example, are there specific issues around minority ethnic attitudes to,\nand use of alcohol which we should bring into our analysis?\nThere are sections of society who are affected by alcohol misuse and in general terms these\ngroups are as follows:-\n(i) Under 18’s obtaining alcohol illegally or drinking at home.\n(ii) 18-25 year old, male and females, involved in weekend late night binge drinking usually\nin town centres which cause the majority of public disorder incidents.\n(iii) Persons with social problems which could include health, family problems, poverty and\nmoney problems.\n(iv) Hardened drinkers and alcoholics who possibly could have a dependency problem.\n(v) Stress related (usually hidden and secretive) which can affect parts of the community\nwith whom the police do not normally have any contact – eg:- persons in business\nprofessions.\n10 It is easy to focus on the negative aspects of alcohol use and misuse, but what are the\npositive cultural and behavioural (as opposed to economic) aspects?  What parts of our\nculture would change for the worse if we did not have alcohol?\nIn some areas, particularly rural communities, the ‘pub’ is the heart and social centre of the\nvillage and, to some extend, it has the same function in the rural areas of towns.  Apart from\nmeeting for a drink, many venues have a good selection of food and they also support sports\nteams such as football, cricket, skittles and darts but also other events such as quiz nights and\nmusic nights.  Without such a venue for interaction, people would become insular and\nboredom is often the catalyst for committing criminal offences and anti-social behaviour.\nIf alcohol were not available, people may turn to drugs for some form of stimulant.\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.doc11 Is there such a thing as a recognisably English drinking culture and, if so, what does it\nlook like?  What are the factors which influence it – for example, are there sharp\nregional differences?  Does it look different for different age groups ?\nThe old fashioned village pub atmosphere does still exist in many areas which enhances\ncommunity spirit but, because it is quiet and causes no problems, very little publicity is given\nto this way of life.\nIn more recent years ‘binge drinking’ has hit the headlines and it is mainly associated with\nyoung people and is considered by many people to be an English disease involving ‘yob’\nculture.  Reasons for this are varied but, to generalise, young people today have more\nfreedom than ever before, there are many more disfunctional families where there is little or\nno discipline or proper role model and young people have more money to spend.  At night,\ntown and city centres are the haunt of young people with accessibility to nightclubs and late\nnight fun pubs and takeaways.  The venues are designed to encourage the young and very\nfew older people feel comfortable in these areas or venues.  Also, it is mainly these venues\nwho have drinks promotions such as (i) buy one get one free (ii) special deals such as pints of\nbeer for £1.00 or (iii) nightclubs who change a £15.00 admission and allow customers to\ndrink free all night.  These type of promotions encourage excess drinking.\n12 What factors influence behaviour – fashion and marketing, family background,\neducation and information, financial, legal and regulatory, scientific, environmental?\nWhich are the most influential in your view? How easy is it to exert influence through\nthose factors?\nAll these factors impact on the drinking culture but the most influential is ‘Marketing’ and\n‘Peer pressure’.  There are voluntary schemes such as the Portman Group scheme which bans\nunsuitable labelled products from its premises but, marketing being what it is, there will need\nto be legislation to enforce this type of scheme throughout the licensing trade.  Peer pressure\ncan only be influenced by education.\n13 How do attitudes to risk affect use of alcohol?\nIn general, people do not take the risk factor into account when drinking.  This is more so in\nthe young who, at that age, consider themselves invincible.  It is only when a medical\nproblem occurs as a result of heavy drinking, or someone commits an alcohol related\noffence, which impacts on their lives such as being banned for drink driving, that people\nconsider the consequences.\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docHEALTH:  PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND THE IMPACT ON THE\nNHS\n14 How do you define drinking?  What factors do you take into account in deciding\nwhether heavy drinking has become problematic drinking?\nI would define ‘harmful drinking’ as excessive consumption of alcohol that causes long-term\nhealth problems and where the person concerned is unable to function as a normal member of\nsociety.  The factors to be taken into account are:\n(i) Where the individual cannot/will not recognise that he/she has a problem\n(ii) Where a problem has been identified but he/she is unable to deal with it.\n(iii) Where a problem has a detrimental effect on a persons work life.\n(iv) Where the drinking causes disruption and problems for family and friends, often\nleading to criminality.\nQuestions 15 – 22 inclusive, directly refers to NHS issues and we are not qualified to\ncomment on these issues.\nCRIME, DISORDER AND ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR:  THE EFFECTS\nON OUR SURROUNDINGS AND COMMUNITY\n23 What evidence is there about the links between alcohol and crime and the links between\nalcohol and anti-social behaviour?  Are there key studies or pieces of evidence you\nthink we should be aware of?  Where are the gaps in the evidence?\nUndoubtedly, alcohol can be linked to crime and anti-social behaviour in the community.  It\nis widely accepted that offences such as criminal damage, public disorder and assaults can be\nlinked to excessive consumption of alcohol and the resultant loss of inhibitions.  These tend\nto be street offences in our cities and towns but also includes more serious offences caused\nby alcohol fuelled domestic violence.\nThere have been studies and evidence over the years, such as the Government’s own\npublications “Taking Stock” and there have been surveys by the Portman Group.\n24 In your experience, is alcohol a factor in habitual re-offending?  Does it lead to\nparticular types of crime ?  How far does it lead to one-off offences?\nAlcohol can often lead to violent crime, which is invariably spontaneous. That being said, it\ncan become habit forming especially in incidents of domestic violence or drunken persons\nacting aggressively provoking people.  This conduct can continue until checked in some way\nsuch as a ban on drink driving or a court appearance.\n25 To what extent can alcohol convincingly be demonstrated to be a factor in criminal and\ndisorderly behaviour?  How much is perception and how much is reality?  What fuels\nthe perceptions and are they accurate?\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docA large proportion of crime and disorder can be attributed to people under the influence of\nalcohol.  These factors are borne out by observations from police patrols, dealing with\nwitnesses and offenders subject of criminal matters and interviewing offenders.  Numerous\ncustody sheets for specific offences, at the relevant times, are endorsed “under the influence\nof alcohol”.  Also many police logs are updated that alcohol was a contributory factor.\n26 Alcohol is far from being the only factor in crime and disorder.  Other factors are\ninvolved – for example, town centre disorder can be influenced by lack of availability of\ntransport or design of environment.  What other factors might be involved?  How easy\nare these factors to influence?  Who is responsible for them?\nOther factors that have an impact on crime and town/city centre disorder are the location and\nnumbers of late night licensed venues.  Many of these close at the same time causing large\ngroups to congregate in the town/city centres.  This causes competition for taxis and take-\naway food outlets, which combined with the consumption of alcohol, leads to confrontation\nand disorder.\nIt would assist if proprietors of late night food outlets take more responsibility for the\nbehaviour of their customers. The late night pubs/clubs have to ensure that they have\nsufficient trained staff to deal with any disorder whereas there is no regulation or control on\nlate night food outlets.\n27 How does the impact of alcohol on urban environments differ from its impact on rural\nenvironments?  Whar are the differences between urban and rural drinking patterns\nand how do they affect those communities and surroundings?\nIn urban areas, there is a greater density of licensed premises and this has the obvious effect\nof generating more customers, greater congestion of people and traffic and later opening  for\nlicensed premises and food outlets.  This usually generates more “hussle and bustle” and\nleads to more confrontational situations.\nWhilst in rural areas, the same facilities are not available in that there are normally no late\nnight venues or late food outlets.  Transportation is normally not an issue in that people either\ndrive, walk or order taxis at the end of the evening.  As a result, there are not the\nconfrontation flash points that there are in the urban environment.\nWhen there are particular rural drink related incidents, the concern amongst local residents is\ngreater than a similar incident merits in urban areas.  The reason for this is that the\nexpectations of people living in the areas are different.  Rural residents are not as tolerant to\ndisturbance/disorder as the people who chose to live in towns and cities.\n28 To what extent can impact on the environment (including crime, disorder, noise and\nwaste) be designed out, for example by use of plastic glasses?  Are there examples of\ngood practice it would be helpful for us to be aware of?\nIn this police area there are examples of good practice where a range of organisations and\npartnerships deal with different aspects of alcohol successfully.  These are as follows:\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.doc(i) The use of arrest referral schemes based at the Custody Centres.  Financing these\nschemes is always an issue but the one at Exeter is run by multi-agency funding.\nAnother in Cornwall (Operation Amethyst) is funded by a Home Office grant.\nAlthough these are excellent schemes, there are still hurdles to be overcome in\nconnection with the sharing of information between the agencies involved.\n(ii) We have a number of Licensees Associations who work closely with the Police and\nthis has proved to be a useful forum for the exchange of ideas and information.  By\nworking together, we have been able to tackle crime and disorder, e.g. banned\npersons lists, early warning pager messages between the police and licensed premises\nand processing intelligence.\n(iii) The use of toughened glasses in late night licensed premises occurs throughout the\nForce with the support of the Local Authorities imposing these conditions on the\nPublic Entertainment Licences.\n(iv) The use of plastic bottles has not been so successful.  There is strong opposition to\nthis condition for late night venues by the licensed trade and BEDA.  There are\nsixteen local authority areas in this Force and only two have adopted this as a\ncondition of the Public Entertainment Licence.  Any injury caused by glass,\nparticularly on the face, can leave terrible scars and affect the aggrieved persons\nhealth, family and job prospects.  (It would put many employees off if someone came\nfor a job interview with a scarred face).\n(v) Make full use of the new powers under the Police and Criminal Justice Act 2001 to\nimpose no drinking zones in designated public areas after consultation with relevant\nagencies and local people.  One problem with this new power is that police cannot\nseize alcohol in a sealed container.  This has caused operational problems when\ndealing with drunken youths hanging around street corners drinking alcohol from\ncans.  The police can seize the open cans but it does cause embarrassment for the\npolice that unopened cans are left with the youths.  Rumours of this loophole are\ndoing the rounds of the schools and this could lead to police baiting by some unco-\noperative youths.\n(vi) The use of CCTV has had a major impact on rural areas.  Local people are aware that\nthey could be monitored and in some cases it might cause potential offenders to think\nbefore they commit an offence.  When offences or incidents do occur, CCTV\nevidence is often relied upon to prove what happened.  The downside of CCTV is that\npotential problems can be displaced to affect other areas.\n(vii) Late night takeaways often generate a lot of debris in the vicinity of their shop, such\nas discarded cartons, paper, food and cans.  Whilst they have a right to run a business,\nit is felt that they should be made responsible for cleaning up the mess generated.\nThis should be done when the takeaway is closing and cover up to a 50 feet radius\nfrom the frontage of the premises. (Such a culture is evident in Germany).  Tidy, well\nkept areas give respectability and often influence people to better behaviour and\nprovides an environment which reduces the fear of crime whereas untidy areas means\nlower standards and anything goes.\n(viii) Adequate street lighting is necessary in the vicinity of late night licensed premises\nand takeaways.  People are less inclined to commit offences where they can easily be\nseen.\n29 There are some examples of good practice where a range of organisations responsible\nfor dealing with different aspects of alcohol, have successfully ‘combined efforts’ and\nshared information to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder together.  Should this\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docapproach be encouraged more widely?  What inhibits organisations or communities\nfrom taking such an approach?\nThe partnership approach is essential and it must be encouraged.\nThere are several reasons inhibiting such an approach:\n(i) Local communities.  Local residents often lack leadership or a united voice.  Effort\nhas to be made (usually by a local individual) to try and encourage people to support\nlocal issues.\n(ii) Costs involved.  Initiatives such as using plastic bottles in late night venues are\nopposed by the drinks industry because they state it costs 10% more to produce\nplastic bottles.\n(iii) People’s time and involvement.  These partnership initiatives are usually in addition\nto work that people are already doing.  Most people are very busy and to take an extra\nresponsibilities is often not a welcome task.\n30 Is it right that anti-crime and anti-social behaviour initiatives need to be targeted on\nyoung people?\nThe simple answer to that is ‘yes’.  They are the ones to influence and educate to break the\nmode of “binge drinking”.\n31  Should we be encouraging different drinking patterns – in terms of time spent drinking\nlocation of drinking etc – in order to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder?\nIt is hoped that the new licensing act will encourage different drinking patterns by allowing\ncommunities a say in deciding operating hours for licensed premises.  With a more relaxed\nattitude to opening hours people should be able to drink at a slower rate over a longer period\nof time and with the same amount of money to spend they should not get so intoxicated.\nIt is necessary to stop this ‘drink until you drop culture” which appears to be a favourite\nweekend activity for the young.  Whilst some older people will cause problems, generally\nspeaking these people have less money to spend as they have families to look after and\nmortgages.\n32 How can the law on, and policing approaches to public drunkenness and street\ndrinking help to tackle these problems?  Are existing controls and powers (such as\nthose for local authorities to introduce no drinking zones) effective? Are they\nsufficient?\nAs indicated in question (28) the police continue to try different initiatives to tackle these\nproblems.  Alcohol is normally supplied from licensed premises and more onus should be\nput on the licensee to shoulder some of the responsibility of customers committing\noffences in the vicinity of licensed premises.  In practice when an incident occurs, the\nlicensee is questioned and the normal excuse is “they must have got drunk elsewhere”.  If\ndisorder occurs in the area which is drink related then there should be powers to have\nlicensed premises (in a designated radius) restricted on opening times.  This type of\nrestriction affects licensee’s profits and it would encourage them to keep an orderly house\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docand not sell alcohol to drunks.  Peer pressure by other licensees in the vicinity would\nencourage all licensed premises to comply.\nThe police end up tackling the problem after it has occurred, the licensee has the power to\nstop the problem occurring.\nAlso cheap drink promotions should not be allowed in the late night licensed premises as it\nencourages drunkenness.\n33 One person’s good evening out can be another persons’ sleepless night.  Are there\nprinciples to guide the balance of individual rights and responsibilities?\nThere is legislation to deal with disorder or violence on the streets but the police have a\nlimited number of officers and it is impossible to stop a certain amount of noise occurring.\nA partnership approach with private and public sector organisations is essential.\n34 Drink – drive polices are generally acknowledged to be successful.  What can we\nlearn from this?\nThe culture has changed over the last 25 years to community intolerance to drink drive.\nThe reasons for this change should be analysed to identify key ingredients which may\nassist in other alcohol related criminality. Apart from social unacceptability, one of the\nmain factors with drink drive offences is that the guilty person is banned from driving for\nnormally at least one year.  Not only does the loss of the driving licence lead to\ninconveniences and increased insurance premiums but also in many cases it could cause\nthat person to loose their job.  Many jobs are driving related or necessitate the use of a\nvehicle to get to and from work and such a ban would mean that person would probably be\nsacked.  This penalty has forced motorists to confront the problem which has let to a\nchange in attitudes.\nUnless the penalty for other drink related offences is severe enough to cause\ninconvenience to the offender then it is doubtful that it make a person reflect on their own\ndrinking habits.\n35 Domestic violence is often associated with alcohol misuse – either by the perpetrator,\nor on occasion, by the victim.  What in your experience, is the nature of this link and\nwhat would you see as good practice in tackling the interrelationship between\ndomestic violence and alcohol misuse?\nAlcohol abuse cause strained relationships in families which can be lead to domestic\nviolence.  This Force has domestic violence officers who assist victims and sometimes\noffenders to face and sort out their problems.  Advice is available to all persons involved.\nAlcohol abuse may be considered as a weighting when risk assessing recidivism and\nthereby influence preventative measures in support of the victim.\nTHE IMPLICATIONS FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS\n36 Which children and young people do you see as being most vulnerable to the\nconsequences of alcohol misuse?\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docPotentially any child but particularly those in the 12-18 year age group.\n37 What other groups would you identify as particularly at risk and vulnerable to\nharmful effects of alcohol?\nThis could include:\n(i)    The homeless\n (ii) Children subject to domestic upheaval and violence\n (iii) Children who are under achieving and more prone to peer pressure\n (iv)     Children who are poorly supervised at home or at school.\n38 Those who are vulnerable to the consequences of alcohol misuse often have complex\nproblems (for example they may be homeless and may have additional mental health\nor drug problems) and such factors may be inter-related.  What key factors need to\nbe understood in addition to alcohol use that contribute to maintaining the problems\nfacing such groups?  Which of these factors should interventions be aimed at?\nKey factors linked to vulnerable groups in our society include the following socio-\neconomic factors: -\n(i) Poor parenting\n(ii) Poor housing\n(iii) Domestic violence\n(iv) Economic factors (unemployment/low income)\n(v) Family illness/stress\n(vi) Poor community support and facilities\n(vii) Poor environment\n(viii) Law achievement and expectations\nInterventions can be focused on any one of these points but key in the approach is the fact\nthat it should be early intervention i.e in young persons, whilst they are still of primary\nschool age.\n39 How can the services provided by the state and others to vulnerable groups with\ncomplex problems be joined up most effectively?  Are there examples of joined up\ndelivery it would be helpful for us to be aware of?  What gets in the way of joining\nup services?\nJoint partnerships do exist such as:\n(i) Drug Action Teams, and\n(ii)       Youth Offending Teams\nQuite often excessive bureaucracy can affect the efficiency and input of such partnerships.\n40 How realistically can these vulnerable groups be dealt with by mainstream services\nand how far do they need services which are tailored to individual groups and\nindeed to individuals on a case-by-case basis?  What is your experience?\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docGenetic approach can deal with vulnerable groups to a certain level, but specialist services\nare required e.g DAT’s, Alcoholics Anonymous etc.  Each case needs to be dealt with on its\nmerits.\nEDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION\n41 What should the objectives in this area?  Is the aim to raise levels of awareness?  Is\nit to inform specifically?  Is it to change behaviour?  Are there any particular\nsuccessful or unsuccessful examples we should be aware of?\nTo educate and raise awareness is of primary importance. To change the social culture\nagainst such anti-social behaviour as exemplified with drink/driving.\n42 Given clear objectives, what is the evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches?\nWhat do they actually achieve?  How can their effectiveness be measured?\nReduction in anti-social behaviour. Greater feeling of community safety.\n  43 How well is the sensible drinking message reaching its audience?  Is it sufficiently\nclear?  What is the evidence on its penetration and its effect on behaviour?\nIt appears to be having little effect.\n44 How well is scientific research feeding into alcohol education? Is the message based\non sound unbiased and uncontroversial research and are new findings effectively\nincorporated?\nScientific research details “turn off” the targeted audience unless there is a message which\nshows there is something in it for the individuals targeted.\n45 Should particular groups be targeted for information and communication?  Is there\na need to provide more intensive alcohol education to groups other than young\npeople (e.g elderly drinkers)?\nEducating young people with regard to alcohol use and misuse is important.  In this Force,\nPolice Youth Affairs Officers work together with School Nurses, School Counsellors, and\nTeaching Teams delivering an education programme on the subject misuse.  The basis\nbeing that a drug is any substance that can affect the way our minds or bodies function.\nThis obviously includes alcohol.\n46 What is the role of schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions in\nproviding alcohol education as well as support for alcohol-related problems?  How\ncan we best establish and preserve a healthy learning environment?\nPlaces of education have a major role is providing alcohol education and to maintain this;\na healthy link between the police and such establishments should be encouraged.\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.doc47 What role is there for families/parents as role models or in educating their children\non sensible levels of alcohol drinking and the risks of alcohol misuse?  How can they\nbest be informed and engaged in this effort?\nParents and families are role models for children and the way that they behave will have\nmore impact than what they say.  How to get the message across to parents is not easy but\nit could be a multi agency approach via the school links such as an additional presentation\nat school open day or something similar.\n48 What does experience show on the most effective means of getting messages across?\nAre there circumstances in which the Government is particularly well placed to do\nso, or conversely might be particularly unsuccessful?\nA police led presentation in places of education will probably make the most impact.  The\nsight of an uniformed police officer can bring home the seriousness of the subject.\n49 What can we learn from educational initiatives in the field of illegal drugs?\nSome drug initiatives use former addicts to inform people of how drugs affected their\nhealth, welfare, family life, job prospects etc.  Perhaps a reformed alcoholic could be used\nin such a presentation, as it would give people the human aspect rather than just facts and\nfigures.\n50 Do you have views on the existing regulation of advertising on alcohol?\nThere is not enough regulation, particularly in reflection to cheap drink promotions, which\nare advertised in local papers and on billboards.  These advertisements often glamorise the\nalcohol drinks so as to be attractive to young people.\nTHE SHAPE OF THE MARKET AND MARKET-BASED SOLUTIONS\n51  Do you have any thoughts on the likely evolution of the alcohol industry over the\nnext decade?\nThe consumption of alcohol is likely to increase.  With the new licensing act, there should\nbe a more liberal, continental style of licensing with increased opening hours.  Unless\nthere is major conflict or a disaster, prosperity should increase which will give people\nmore money to spend on leisure activities including alcohol consumption.\n52 What is the relationship between the creation of trends and fashions in alcohol\nconsumption by the market and consumers responding to trends and fashions?  Are\nthere discernible patterns which the Government might use in responding to the\neffects of alcohol misuse?  Is there useful evidence we might draw on?\nOf particular concern, is the current trend of targeting the younger drinkers with alco-pops\nand shots.  These are deliberately marketed to appeal to the younger drinkers as they look\nattractive and taste of fruit juices.  They encourage a culture of excessive drinking by the\nyounger more vulnerable age group who would not normally drink spirits.\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.docAn example of this trend was evident at a recent “life skills” event involving 10 and 11\nyear old school children.  They were shown a selection of alco-pops and most were able to\nidentify all of them by name and brand and indicated that they have tried them for\nthemselves at home.\n53 How far do you foresee research and development creating innovative market-led\nsolutions to the problems of alcohol misuse?\nIn the future there will probably be some medical prescription to stop obesity, which could\nbe caused by excess beer drinking.  There will also probably be a pill to cure hangovers so\nremoving the morning after thought “that I will never drink again”.\n54 How best can Government work with the alcohol industry to reach consumers?\nWhat approaches have been shown to be effective in England, the devolved\nadministrations and further afield?\nThe Government should work closely with the Industry.  Adherence to the Portman Group\nCode of Practice should be compulsory not voluntary.\n55 Are there other commercial interests which can influence drinking behaviour?\nThe price and availability of drinks is a major influence.\nTHE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ALCOHOL\n(56) to (61) deal with commercial issues and I am unable to reply to these specific\nquestions.\nAs a general comment under this heading, maybe there could be an increase to business rates\nfor alcohol outlets in order to contribute more money to policing costs.  For example shop\nlike Dorothy Perkins are probably paying the same business rate as a medium size late night\nfun pub.  The potential policing problems from Dorothy Perkins are somewhat less than that\nfor the fun pub and maybe this should be reflected in the rates.\nLast year this Force reviewed and produced its own Licensing Strategy document.  It is police\norientated but I have enclosed a copy for your information.\nYours sincerely\nACC(O)\nMr S J PEARCE\nC:\\TEMP\\Draft Let for ACC(O) re Nat Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy      13.01.03.doc\n",

I understand that more than 30 people have been killed in an explosion in Mosul while attacks in Baquba and Ramadi have resulted in the deaths of around another 20 people. Many more Iraqis have been wounded.  My sincere condolences go to the families of the victims.'\n\n\n\n'We have long expected that there would be difficult times in the run-up to the hand-over of sovereignty to the Iraqis. These attacks are targeted on those Iraqis who are working hard to build a better future for their country.  They are aimed at depriving the Iraqi people of the peaceful and democratic future they deserve.  They will not succeed. We are giving our full support to the Iraqi Interim Government in their work to establish strong Iraqi security forces and to help prevent similar attacks in the future.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nالترجمة العربية\nRead more about Iraq...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t \t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Kettle\n\n\nGuardian, June 30th 1999, p. 14\n\n\nPresident Clinton has announced a new health prescription benefit\nworth up to $2000 a year.  Cumulative budget surpluses over 15\nyears are expected to yield an influx of tax dollars into the\nUS Treasury, widening the scope for spending without imposing\nfresh tax burdens on middle class voters.\n\n\n(See also Financial Times, June 30th 1999, p. 7)\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDING SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THREAT : QUESTIONS\nAND STRATEGIES\n\n\n\nL. Levitt,  A. H. Beckerman and P. Johnson\n\n\nJournal of Social Work Practice, vol. 13, 1999, p. 59-67\n\n\nScenarios which envisage an enhanced role for social work in health\ncare all require an increased knowledge of the workings of the\nmarket and a greater ability on the part of the profession to\nparticipate in the market as a forceful player.  They require\nthe emergence of the social work profession as an important force\nin efforts to reform health care in the US to achieve universal\naccess, a uniform payment system, and more effective controls\nover expenditure.  Health care professions need to develop a political\norientation which recognises the need to organise interdisciplinary\ncoalitions which share the struggle to protect health and social\nservices.\n\n\n\n\nA FISTFUL OF DOLLARS\n\n\n\nH. Berliner\n\n\nHealth Service Journal, vol. 109, June 17th 1999, p. 28\n\n\nReports that lawsuits to reclaim the costs of treating the wounded\nfrom gun manufacturers are the latest development in US litigation.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL HEALTH POLICIES : SUB-SAHURAN AFRICAN CASE STUDIES\n(1980-1990)\n\n\n\nK. Dugbatey\n\n\nSocial Science and Medicine, vol. 49, 1999,  p. 223-249\n\n\nFour countries, Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Zimbabwe were\nchosen as cases to study the impact of national health policies\non national health status in sub-Shaharan Africa.  Through a conceptual\nframework that covers health problem identification, policy formation\nand implementation procedures, the study examined national translations\nof Primary Health Care (PHC) and Health for All by the Year 2000\n(HFA/2000) strategies.  Study concluded that policies formulated\nand implemented in accordance with key PHC principles could account\nfor improvements in national health status.\n\n\n\n\nOBLIGATORY MEDICAL INSURANCE IN RUSSIA : THE PARTICIPANTS'\nPERSPECTIVE.\n\n\n\nJ. L. Twigg\n\n\nSocial Science and Medicine, vol. 49, 1999, p. 371-382\n\n\nPaper offers a brief description of the parameters of the Russian\nmedical insurance system introduced in 1993 to raise funds for\nhealth care.  Then presents the results of a survey which asked\nmanagers of the two major new institutional participants in health\ncare financing, private medical insurance companies and the 89\ngovernmental Territorial Health Insurance Funds, their opinions\nof the structural and behavioural aspects of the new system. \nThese survey findings illustrate the dynamics of the bureaucratic\nand institutional conflict which has led to incomplete and flawed\nimplementation of the insurance system.\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICAL ANALYSIS OF HEALTH REFORM IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\n\n\nA. Glassman and others\n\n\nHealth Policy and Planning, vol. 14, 1999,  p. 115-126\n\n\nArticle presents a method of political analysis for health sector\npolitics, and identifies key patterns in the politics of health\nreform proposals.  Uses the experience of one country, the Dominican\nrepublic, to illustrate the political challenges of health reform.\n\n\n\n\nPRIVATE HEALTH CARE IN NIGERIA : WALKING THE TIGHTROPE\n\n\n\nI. Ogunbekun, A. Ogunbekun and N. Orobaton\n\n\nHealth Policy and Planning, vol. 14, 1999, p. 174-181\n\n\nThe inadequacy of state health care services has made the private\nsector an unavoidable choice for consumers of health care in Nigeria.\n However, ineffective state regulation has meant little control\nover the clinical activities of private sector providers while\nthe price of medical services has grown faster than the average\nrate of inflation.  Reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency\nof the private sector are urgently required if costs are to be\ncontained.\n\n\n\n\nQUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS IN HEALTH CARE : PROBLEM SOLVING\nIN THE WORKPLACE\n\n\n\nE. Gilpatrick\n\n\nThousand Oaks, Calif: Sage, 1999.\n\n\nBook reviews the basic techniques for carrying out quality improvement\nresearch. Then describes how these techniques can be implemented\nthrough 14 case studies involving actual health care situations.\n Written from a US perspective.\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCE DEPENDENCY, DOCTORS AND THE STATE:  QUALITY CONTROL\nIN SWEDEN\n\n\n\nP. Garpenby\n\n\nSocial Science and Medicine, vol. 49, 1999, p. 405-424\n\n\nPaper focuses on the interaction between the state and the medical\nprofession on the national level in Sweden with respect to issues\nconcerning quality development in health care. The increased politicising\nof the issue of health care quality resulted in public organisations\nhaving reason to increase their interaction with professional\nassociations.  Interest in the resources controlled by the profession\nmotivated the development of inter-organisational relationships.\n Equally, the professional bodies also needed resources controlled\nby the state.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE PRIVATIZATION PROCESS ON TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL\nIN HOCHIMINH CITY PROVINCE, VIETNAM\n\n\n\nE. Naterop and J. Wolffers\n\n\nSocial Science and Medicine,  vol. 48, 1999, p. 1589-1598\n\n\nPaper describes the functioning of the National Tuberculosis Program\n(NTP)  in the province of HoChiMinh City, and the impact of the\nprivatisation process.  Problems of double infection with HIV\nand TB mean that an integrated strategy for AIDS and tuberculosis\nis required.\n\n\nThis would have to include the development of a health education\nprogramme and the training of private practitioners in the treatment\nof TB.  Health education is essential for tuberculosis control\nbut will not be initiated within the private sector.  It is essential\nthat the NTP and the private sector co-operate in health education\nand training initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPANISH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM : LESSONS FOR NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED\nCOUNTRIES.\n\n\n\nE.

His work has been acclaimed by many, reviled by some, and an entirely predictable outcry met the announcement of 'MOTHER CLAP'S MOLLY HOUSE' and the disclaimer that the play \"contains scenes and language which some people may find offensive\". DAN REBELLATO \n\n\n\nIt seems in the early eighteenth century we were just as mercenary and sexually unrepressed as we are at the beginning of the twenty first century judging by the activities going on in Mother Claps Molly House, a sort of male brothel. \n\n\n\nThe sort of thing that went on is described in evidence given by one William Davison at the trial of Thomas Wright for Sodomy in April 1726 - \"The discovery of the Molly House was chiefly owing to a quarrel betwixt P and Harrington. P to be revenged on Harrington gave a large information. The Mollies had heard little of the first discovery. I was introduced to the company and in a large room there we found one a-fiddling and eight more a-dancing country dances, making vile motions and singing, ' Come Let Us Fuck Finely'.  Then they sat in one another's laps, talked bawdy and practised great many indecencies\". PROGRAMME NOTE \n\n\n\nThe play originated as a workshop production presented and commissioned by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art where a great deal of script development had taken place. \n\n\n\nSo a sound provenance. What has it given us? A literary forward looking piece of worthwhile and challenging new drama or a self-indulgent celebration of gay promiscuity? Maybe I'm a coward but I'm ducking this issue. When the play starts its West End run at the Aldwych Theatre the public will make their own judgement. \n\n\n\nDirector Nicholas Hytner has brought together an interesting range of contrasting physical shapes in his wonderful ensemble cast. As a piece of animated sculpture apart from early slow bits the productions sweeps marvellously through its two hours and Giles Cadle's wonderful set gives it all a spectacular frame work. The 'artful' way in which the play move back and forth between the eighteenth century and modern times is fascinating and works in a very smooth and attractive manner. \n\n\n\nI am sure that within the play there lies many statements of social significance, some made during the four examples of homosexual physical celebration going on right before our eyes, but I can't bring any to mind. The play remains a celebration of its own philosophy and a very real and exciting ground breaking evening in the theatre. \n\treviewer:\tMichael Kelligan \n\t\t\t This review has been read \n       317 times \n\n      \n\t \t\n      \n\n      Was this review useful to you?

All of my meetings carried the same message: that the UK is ready to engage in a full and proper relationship with North Korea once the concerns of the international community, on issues such as nuclear programmes and human rights, have been addressed.'\n\n\n\n'The regime has indicated a willingness to engage with us.  The fact that they agreed to participate for the first time in a serious discussion on human rights is a welcome and positive step.  I also pressed hard for a firm commitment to the nuclear talks process, which they agreed to in principle.  But they need to do more in committing to a date for the next round of talks.  I was genuinely pleased that, following my representation about the reports of an alleged nuclear explosion in North Korea, the Foreign Minister was able to provide an early explanation and agreed to a visit to the site by the British Ambassador and diplomats from other countries.  This is a small but significant concession given the secretive nature of the regime.'\n\n\n\n'The visit has been very constructive but we still have a long way to go in developing a proper relationship.  The choice rests with the North Koreans.  Real engagement would lead to huge benefits for the country and its people.  Continued isolation will only bring further problems for North Korea.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorea (DPR) Country Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current Press Releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Not least that Paul Bremer, the man who runs the country for the Americans has been called back for urgent talks at the Whitehouse.  There is also Iran, who have been forced to admit that they have been producing plutonium and enriched uranium even though they have denied it for eighteen years.  You would only want that sort of stuff if you wanted to make a bomb.  The American Secretary of State Colin Powell said Iran had dragged the scared garments of Islam in to the political gutter.  Well on the line is Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary.  How do you think we should be dealing with Iran?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWe should be reacting calmly to the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The Iranians have been concealing activities for many years, which they should have disclosed under the terms of the Non-proliferation Treaty.  Since the IAEA board however, passed a very tough resolution by thirty five votes to one (the only one being Iran) on 12 September Doctor Al Baradei is reporting a considerable degree of co-operation by the Iranians.  And this report which is certainly very worrying in terms of what it discloses, also shows a pretty high level of co-operation.  I can't say whether the co-operation has been complete but it has certainly been substantial.  The next stage is that the report will be considered by the IAEA board on 20 November, in just over a week's time and in the meantime there will be discussions with all our partners about what approach we should take.  And certainly from the UK position, what I want to do about it is to ensure that it is resolved peacefully, quickly and within the terms of international treaties to which Iran and the rest of us are signed up.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nThe point about this is that Iran has been even more badly than Iraq in the sense that we now have evidence that they were actively pursuing a nuclear programme.  And again there was no evidence that Iraq was an active state sponsor of terrorism.  Why is our reaction to Iran so very different to our reaction to Iraq?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWell in principle I don't think it is.  We took military action in respect of Iraq twelve years after Iraq invaded Kuwait and after resolution 678 and then 687 was passed saying that Iraq posed a threat to international peace and security.  And also authorising all necessary means which means military action in respect of Iraq.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nSo why don't we go to the United Nations now and say we should do the same to Iran?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nBecause we have to pursue these matters patiently and by diplomatic means.  Now there are no chapter seven resolutions in respect of Iran whereas there were a whole host of them in respect of Iraq.  And what I was making clear repeatedly on your programme as well as in many other places during the run up to military action in respect of Iraq, was that we wanted a diplomatic solution to the situation in Iraq.  And the international community had sought that solution to the problems in Iraq over the period not of twelve months but of twelve years.  Now you say that the transgressions by Iran are more serious than those by Iraq, I beg to differ.  There is no evidence of large scale active chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes on the scale which were disclosed and were discovered having been clandestinely hidden by the Iraqis in the mid 1990s.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nSo well hidden that we still haven't found them.\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWith great respect they were found and they were found only after defections by Iraqis and not by inspections and they were concealing those under the noses of inspectors.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nBut here we have Colin Powell saying the Iranian regime has dragged the sacred garments of Islam in to the political gutter.  Now we are the closest ally of the United States but we seem to be taking a very different view indeed of what he is saying about Iran.\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWell this allows me to make another point because we are either the poodles of the United States or, when we actually have a slightly different opinion from the United States, we are divided.  What we have are some differences of emphasis.  We are all agreed about the obligations which should be imposed on Iran and we all agreed the resolution that came before the IAEA board on 12 September.  There are different analyses about Iran because of the history between Iran and the United States and the issue of Iran and America is felt more sensitively than it is in Europe.  Now we have different analyses but we share a common objective.  We want first of all to see Iran fully and completely complying with its international obligations.  And we want to see a process by which Iran comes fully in to the democratic modern fold while having and being able to show full respect to its Islamic roots and to the fact that is an Islamic Republic.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nYou've said twice before on this programme that that the idea of attacking Iran is not on the agenda at all and will not be.  But if Mr Powell says we must go down the sanctions road, will you support him?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nFirst of all you are right to quote me twice on the programme, I am happy to repeat it a third time, just to say that there is no kite flying on that one.  It is a matter for the IAEA board to decide whether or not the matter should be referred to the Security Council and in what circumstances.  Now I am not going to pre-empt the decisions of the IAEA board taking place in about nine days time.  We will be discussing with our international partners and in particular as well the discussions which I will be holding with Secretary Powell.  I will also be discussing this matter in great detail with Dominic De Villepin and Joschkar Fischer, the French and German foreign ministers with whom I made the very important visit to Tehran on 20 October.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nCan I turn to Iraq?  Paul Bremer has been called back to Washington for talks at the Whitehouse, crisis talks some would say.  What do you want to see?  What do you believe will come out of those talks and what do want to see come out of those talks?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWell it is not surprising that there is continuing discussion between Paul Bremer, the head of the Coalition Commission Authority and the administration.  I am not party to the talks nor a party to his return visit but what has been happening obviously the security situation is unsatisfactory and that is well known.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nIt is disastrous isn't it?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWell it is unsatisfactory and in particular in Baghdad and the Sunni triangle, but elsewhere including in the South where we are in control, it is satisfactory in general.  And I should also say that over all much else in terms of life in Iraq is now better than it was before the military action commenced.  So there are two issues which are under serious discussion at the moment.  One is the issue of how you improve the security and that is a matter which was discussed between the United Kingdom government and General Myers and General Zabazaid when they were here last week.  The second is how do you create a greater dynamic in the political process in order to see what we all want to happen as soon as possible, namely a transfer of power and sovereignty to the Iraqi people?  We are all agreed about that and resolution 1511 in the Security Council said that it should happen as quickly as possible, the question is how?  And what you have to do is to keep that constantly under review.  Up to now the view has been you make the governing council the agent of that process, but there have also been suggestions, not just from the United States and ourselves but from our other partners, that there may be other ways of achieving that.  The analogy used on your programme earlier this morning was the Afghanistan model, all of those matters need to be looked at because there is this deadline of 15 December which has been set by the United Nations by which more detailed plans have to be produced.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nHow do you react to the comments from the Iraqi foreign minister in an interview he did for the Financial Times in which he talked about American in-fighting and blamed geriatric ambassadors, taken to be a reference to our own Sir Jeremy Greenstock?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nLook there have been a lot of discussions about what to do in Iraq because this issue is difficult, the more difficult the issues are the more detailed discussions you have.  But both discussions are taking place in Washington, in London and in Baghdad, they will continue.  Going back six months, people said that Iraq would be ungovernable, that we wouldn't get the hospitals, the schools, the water supply going, we wouldn't be able to have a currency transfer, we wouldn't get the economy going.  All of those things have happened.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nBut as you say, all over shadowed by the security situation, something has got to be done about that.  Is the way to deal with it to hand over power to the Iraqi people very much more quickly than had been planned even if it is only an appointed government?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWe want to hand over power to the Iraqi people as quickly as possible and it could well be that we hand over power to the Iraqis more quickly than planned.  However, we as the coalition have clear responsibilities for security in Iraq.  So we want to see this process happen as quickly as we can.  But it also has to happen in a responsible way where those who are receiving the power or the partial transfer of power can also be assured that there are sufficient facilities and arrangements in place for the better security of Iraq.  Now we are making progress on that, the numbers of police are going to rise, it is going to rise from forty thousand to seventy thousand, we are very heavily involved in training the police numbers in the Iraqi civil defence force and the static guarding forces are rising.  And you have seen for example far fewer examples of sabotage of major infrastructure in Iraq partly as a result.  But yes, we want to move ahead as quickly as possible but also in the context of better security and assurances about security for the Iraqi people.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nGeorge Bush is coming to this country next week.  Who agreed that it should be a state visit?  Who recommended it and why?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nThe decision was made seventeen months ago by the Royal Visits Committee and then, which is a committee which is based principally of members of the Royal household and the Foreign Office with other government departments.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nThe Royal household just does what it is told by the Foreign Office.\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWell it is a process of discussion and then the decisions are that the recommendations from the Royal Visits Committee go to Ministers including myself, other Cabinet Ministers and the Prime Minister.  It was agreed a long time ago and personally I think it is a very good idea. It is always the case that at least once during a President's term of office there is a large scale visit.  But if this was a visit by which President Bush was a guest of government, which for practical purposes, not for formal purposes, amounts to the same thing, you would be asking me all the same questions.  And there would be speculation about demonstrations in the newspapers in exactly the same way.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nDoes it bother you that he is going to use the visit so we are told, for political purposes back in the United States?  And it doesn't bother you that half the British public according to a Times poll yesterday, regard Mr Blair's closeness to Mr Bush as bad for Britain?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nWhat bothers me is the fashionable anti Americanism that is around.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nWhy is it fashionable?\n\n\nJACK STRAW:\n\nBecause many more people I guess will be demonstrating about the United States and the action that the United States has had to take since 11 September.  Never have they demonstrated against the brutal, vicious, horrible regime of Saddam Hussein which has lead as we now know following the liberation of Iraq, to the discovery of mass graves which sadly are the graves of at least three hundred thousand dead souls in Iraq.  Now people are entitled to demonstrate but what I hope will come from this visit and consideration about this visit is a mature reflection on the nature of our relationship with the United States and with Europe and its importance.  And yes, there are issues on which we sometimes disagree as we do for example on steel tariffs or on climate change.  There are issues sometimes where you may have a slightly different analysis as we do in respect in respect for example of the Middle East or in respect as you were talking about, the IAEA report.  Not a great deal but something, there are other issues over all on which we agree profoundly.  America is our largest trading, trading partner by far, huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic depend on that relationship.  But above all what people have to decide is whether it is better in our interests and that of European countries for America to be pushed away from Europe and the United Kingdom, to become more and more isolated or whether we engage in a constructive partnership with the United States respecting them for what they are?  Which happens to be the oldest and one of the largest democracies in the world and a great force much more for good than many people are willing to concede.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\t \t\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\nJAN\n\n\t\n\nFEB\n\n\t\n\nMAR\n\n\n\t\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\nMAY\n\n\t\n\nJUN\n\n\n\t\n\nJUL\n\n\t\n\nAUG\n\n\t\n\nSEP\n\n\n\t\n\nOCT\n\n\t\n\nNOV\n\n\t\n\nDEC\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, if only one name is used, it should be the first, eg. President Khamtay.)\nGEOGRAPHY\n\nLaos is a land-locked country, bounded by China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Burma. It is largely mountainous.  The most fertile land is found in the valley of the Mekong, which flows from the north of Laos to the south and which forms the frontier with Thailand for over 60% of its length.\n\nHISTORY\n\nRecent History\n\nAfter gaining its independence from France in 1953, the Kingdom of Laos found itself embroiled in regional conflicts resulting from the struggle for control of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese supported the Pathet Lao, a nationalist front organisation controlled by the communist  Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). The Thais and the Americans supported right-wing groups.  Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister for most of the period from 1951 to 1975, attempted to follow a neutral course.\n\nFollowing the American withdrawal from Vietnam the Lao Communists consolidated their control of Laos, which culminated in the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in December 1975.\n\nAs the LPRP instituted a one-party state and introduced tough socialist reforms of the economy it continued its hard line policies until economic difficulties in the late 1980s forced it to bring in more liberal measures in line with those being adopted in Vietnam, with which Laos has been closely aligned since 1975.\n \nIn 1992 Kaysone Phomvihane, the long-time leader of the LPRP, died. He was succeeded as party leader by the then Prime Minister, Khamtay Siphandone. Since then the government and party have cautiously and half-heartedly introduced market reforms, while maintaining tight political control in a one-party system of government.\n\nLonger Historical Perspective\n\nThe Lao are one branch of the Tai ethnic group which moved southwards from southern China, settling in parts of present day Laos from at least the thirteenth century.  From its foundation in 1353 until about 1700 the Lao Kingdom of Lane Xang was one of the most powerful states in mainland Southeast Asia and included much of present day Thailand. Thereafter the kingdom was divided into rival principalities and fell into decline, losing power to the expanding Vietnamese and Siamese states.  It was effectively saved from absorption by these two states by the establishment of a French protectorate at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nUnder French rule development in Laos, whether it be economic, educational or political, was slow compared to that in Vietnam and Cambodia, the other countries in French Indochina. A stimulus to political development was provided by the Japanese occupation of Indochina during the Second World War. After the Japanese defeat in August 1945 a Free Lao movement, the Lao Issara, proclaimed Lao independence, but with the support of the King and Crown Prince the French regained control of the country in 1946, driving the nationalists into exile. The French finally granted Lao independence in 1953.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBBC Monitoring Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICS\n\nRecent Political Developments\n\nThe government celebrated the 25th anniversary of its accession to power in December 2000 without disruption. The seventh congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party was held in March 2001, and later that month the National Assembly endorsed a number of changes to the government, including the replacement of Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphan by Bounnyang Vorachit.\n\nThe National Assembly sat most recently in April/May 2003. In addition to the changes in the constitution related to the economy described below, fundamental rights now include the 'right to complain and right to charge'. The Powers of the President were also strengthened. The position now has the power to propose to the National Assembly the appointment or removal of the Prime Minister.\n\nThere have been a series of fatal violent incidents in 2004 including bombings and armed attacks on buses. These have occurred in Vientiane and on roads leading from the Capital, in particular Route 13 between Viang Vieng to Luang Prabang and Route 7 between Phoukhon and Phonsavan. Civilians, including two foreign tourists, have been killed and many others injured. It is unclear who is behind these incidents, but Hmong insurgents have been blamed. On 2 October Bouasone Bouphavanh was appointed Deputy Prime Minister responsible for home affairs to tackle mounting tensions.\n\nElections\n\nThe last general elections were held on 24 February 2002 and resulted in many changes in the National Assembly, although only one non-party member was elected. The electoral term is five years.\n\nECONOMY\n\nBasic Economic Facts\n\nGDP: US$ 1.8 (2002)\n\nGDP per capita: US$328 (2002)\n\nGDP per capita (PPP): US$1,575 (2000)\n\nAnnual Growth: 6% (2003 estimate)\n\nInflation: 8%\n\nMajor Sectors: Agriculture (50% of GDP), Services (26%) - wholesale and retail the largest part, of this.  Industry (24%) - garment manufacturing, food processing and low – tech assembly are growth sectors.\n\nMajor trading partners: Laos is a net importer and mainly trades with counties of the region. In 2002 the main trading partners were: Vietnam, Thailand, France, Germany, Belgium, China, Singapore , Japan.\n \nAid & development: Aid to Laos in 1998 totalled US$ 281m. Of US$ 165m in bilateral aid, by far the largest donor was Japan, at over US$ 85m.  International organisations working with Laos who have offices in Vientiane include the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and various UN agencies.\n\nExchange rate: £1 = 14,200 January 2004)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK Trade & Investment Country Profile: Laos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nLaos' Relations with its Neighbours\n\nAlthough the Lao people are much more closely related to the Thais than to other neighbours in language and culture, Laos was linked to Vietnam and Cambodia as part of French Indochina from the end of the nineteenth century until independence in 1953. Following an attempt to steer a neutral course, ties with Vietnam and Cambodia were strengthened after the communist victories in all three countries in 1975. Relations with the strongly anti-Communist governments of Thailand were difficult. In the aftermath of the Sino-Vietnamese rift of the late 1970s and 1980s, Laos' relations with China were also strained.\n\nAs the general situation in mainland Southeast Asia improved in the 1980s and early 1990s with a decrease in ideological alignments and progress towards a solution of the divisive Cambodian problem, Laos was able significantly to improve ties with other countries in the region. The first bridge across the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos was opened in April 1994.  In November 1994 the Mekong River Commission was established – involving Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam - whose principle objective is the sustainable utilisation of the Mekong Basin. Laos joined ASEAN in July 1997.\n\nLaos' Relations with the International Community\n\nLaos is currently chair of ASEAN and will host the Summit meeting in Vientiane on 29 November 2004. Laos co-chaired with Greece the EU/ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in January 2003 in Brussels.  The EU Commission opened an office in Laos in May 2003.  Laos joined ASEM in October 2004.\n\nLAOS' RELATIONS WITH THE UK\n\nDiplomatic Representation\n\nThe first resident British Ambassador arrived in Laos in the mid-1950s.  The Embassy was closed in 1985, and responsibility for British representation to Laos passed to the British Ambassador in Bangkok, who manages the British Trade Office (BTO) in Laos. The current British Ambassador to the Lao People's Democratic Republic is His Excellency Mr David Fall. He arrived in Thailand in August 2003. The BTO opened in Vientiane in 1995, and covers trade issues and development work. Current relations with Laos are friendly if limited.\n\nThe Laos, similarly, had an Embassy in London from the 1950s until it was closed in the mid-1980s. The current Lao Ambassador in Paris, His Excellency Mr Soutsakhone Pathammavong is accredited to the UK.\n\nAmbassade de la Republique Democratique Populaire Lao\n\nUK overseas mission in Laos\nThe UK played an important diplomatic role in Laos as Co-Chairman (along with the former USSR) of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indo-China and the 1961/2 Geneva Conference on Laos.\n\nUK Development Assistance\n\nThe Department for International Development (DfID) does not have a bilateral aid programme for Laos. However small scale UK assistance is provided through the Small Grant Scheme (administered by the British Trade Office in Vientiane and the British Embassy in Bangkok), the DfID Civil Society Challenge Fund, and support for individual projects under Foreign and Commonwealth Office programme budgets.\n\nA UK project to introduce a nationwide system of Childrens Justice by 2006 is well under way as the National Assembly announced in October that a draft bill would be prepared by the end of the 2004. The project, which started as a pilot in 2000, began full implementation in 2001. The initiative is undertaken by the Ministry of Justice with technical support from Save the Children and financial support from the FCO Human Rights Project Fund. The project delivers training to judges, prosecutors, police officers and local officials on principles of children's rights and juvenile justice. This leads on to reforms to the local justice system which divert children from the formal justice system, promote non-custodial sentencing, establish specialist youth courts, and resolve cases through village mediation using principles of restorative justice. So far the project has reached half of all provinces in the country and trained more than 2500 officials.\n\nIn 2001-2003 Small Grant Scheme support was given to projects relating to HIV/AIDS and malaria.  Other assistance was provided to rural development, education, human rights, mine/UXO clearance and drug control.\n \nTrade and Investment with the UK\n\nBilateral trade between the UK and Laos accounts for only a small portion of UK trade with SE Asia.  Imports from Laos in 2002 were worth £10.1 million (up 41.8% on 2001 - £7.1 million). UK exports to Laos in 2002 were £1.6 million (down 32% on 2001 - £2.3 million). The UK's top exports to Laos include general industrial machinery and equipment, and telecommunications. The UK's top imports from Laos include apparel and clothing accessories, and footwear.\n\nCultural Relations with the UK\n\nCultural links are relatively limited in nature. However in 2001 the David Glass Interactive Theatre Group worked with the Lao Women's Union to stage a number of performances in Vientiane with the theme of raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and drug issues.\n\nThe number of British visitors to Laos has increased over recent years, numbering 15,700 in 2001. This is second only to France in terms of visitors from Europe.\n\nRecent Visits\n\nIn the margins of the EU/ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Vientiane in 2000 the Foreign Office Minister John Battle met Lao Foreign Minister, Somsavat Lengsavat. Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett also met the Lao Foreign Minister in the margins of the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in Kuala Lumpur in July 1997.\n\nInward\n\n\tAug 1999: Soubanh Srithirath, Minister in the President's Office and Chairman of the Lao National Commission on Drug Control\n\n\tJun 2001: Phongsavath Boupha, Deputy Foreign Minister\n\n\tJan 2003: Sayakane Sisouvong, Director General, ASEAN Department. Ministry of Foreign Affairs \n\n\nOutward\n\n\t1987: The Princess Royal to visit Save the Children Fund (UK)\n\n\tDec 2000: Mr Battle, Minister of State, FCO, for an EU/ASEAN meeting\n\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe human rights situation in Laos has improved over the last decade, but some issues still arouse concern, particularly the treatment of a small number of political prisoners and Christian activists.  The most prominent political prisoners are Latsami Khamphoui and Feng Sakchittaphong. Thongsouk Saysangkhi, a third prisoner, died in prison in 1998.  The three were arrested in October 1990 and held without charge for two years.  In 1992 they were sentenced to 14 years in prison for forming a 'social democrat club' to advance democratic ideas.  The defendants were not permitted legal representation at their trial and the sentence was harsh.  The UK, along with EU partners, has raised its concern about these cases with the Lao authorities.\n\nFive protestors, Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Khamphouvieng Sisaath, Seng-Aloun Phengphanh, Keochay and Bouavanh Chanmanivong, were arrested in Vientiane on 26 October 1999 and sentenced to prison terms believed to be for 10 years, apparently for attempting to stage a political protest. Sentences on two of the five, we understand, have since been reduced from 10 to 5 years. The EU has raised its concerns about the five with the Lao authorities. There are reports of harassment of Christians by the Lao authorities, who appear to object to active proselytising by some groups rather than to the right of peaceful worship, which is recognised by the Lao Constitution. Another cause for concern is the alleged mistreatment of the ethnic Hmong people in Laos. Amnesty International have reported continuing government clashes with Hmong insurgents and forced relocation of Hmong villages. The UK regularly raises these issues with the Lao government when opportunities arise.\n \nLaos has long held a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. But in April 2001 the scope of\napplication of the death penalty was extended to drug related crimes at the urging of ASEAN partners. Three individuals were sentenced to death by the Vientiane Municipality Court on 19th June 2002. We understand that one individual has now had his sentence reduced to 25 years and further appeals are pending on the other two.  The EU has urged Laos to maintain its de facto moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThe average life expectancy at birth is 52.3 years for men and 54.8 years for women. This compares to 67.3 years for men and 73.2 years for women in neighbouring Thailand. It is estimated that 14,000 people die from malaria each year.  Rates of HIV/AIDS infection are slowly increasing. Around 120 people die each year as a result of ordnance explosions.\n\nTRAVEL\n\nTravel Advice: Laos\nLast reviewed - 22 October 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is the only true multi-role jet aircraft in service in the UK inventory. Optimised for operations from ships at sea, it's short take-off and vertical landing capability has dramatically enhanced the ability of the Invincible class of Aircraft Carriers to project air power in support of UK interests worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe FA2 (Fighter Attack) is a development of its predecessor the Sea Harrier FRS1 (Fighter/ Reconnaissance/Strike) concentrating on the avionics and weapons system of the aircraft giving it a much improved air-to-air combat capability, essential to its main task of providing a carrier group with air defence. The Blue Vixen radar coupled with the medium range AIM-120 AMRAAM missile gives the FA2 the ability to engage hostile aircraft before they come into visual range.  Although the main task of the FA2 was air defence it had the capability to be used in the ground attack role, however, the GR7/GR9 would be the first choice of aircraft for this type of mission.\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\t\n        Sea Harrier\n        FA2 Aircraft Specifications\n\n      \n\n\n    \n\n\tLength\t14m\n\tEngine\tA single Rolls Royce Pegasus vectored\n        thrust turbofan.

This is to ?ensure a credible expeditionary offensive capability is maintained until the aircraft leaves service. Supporting this decision the Ministry of Defence said:\n\n\n\n\"These days we don't fight the kind of wars where our ships need defending from enemy warplanes far out at sea. Aircraft Carriers are now mostly supporting shore operations by flying strike missions and it makes far better sense to spend our money on Harriers which can do that best. If necessary, we can rely on coalition forces to provide the outer air defence for surface ships.\"\n\n\n\nAn added level to the layered air defence will be provided by the new  Type 45 Destroyer  equipped with the sophisticated and lethal Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS) which is capable of controlling several missiles in the air at any one time, each one of which could engage individual targets, preventing attackers from swamping the fleet's air defences.\n\n\n\nIt is intended that the Harrier force be completely replaced by the  Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA)  also referred to as the Joint Strike Fighter which is due to enter service in 2012 and be operated from the Royal Navy?s  Future Aircraft Carriers (CVF). \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t?

          "Royal Navy\n\n\n\t\nTue  9 Nov 2004\n\nON BOARD SHIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\tWaste Disposal\n\n\n \n\nPlastic Waste \n\nIt is illegal to discharge plastic waste anywhere at sea. A machine is used to compact and seal all plastic waste. This is then taken to shore in the UK for environmentally sound disposal. \n\n\n\nGarbage \n\nGarbage is classified as waste such as paper, cardboard, glass, tins etc. A garbage-processing unit deals with this by taking all kinds of unsorted waste and shredding and compacting it.\nThe compacted waste is then stored on board for later disposal ashore.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Waste \n\nUneaten food is processed through a food pulper, this grinds the waste up into slurry that can be safely discharged at sea when more than 3 miles from land. The Royal Navy is now introducing new generation food pulpers that recycle the water used and produce a “dry” waste that can be stored for later disposal. \n\n\n\nSewage Treatment Plant \n\nMost current warships operate a \"Biological Sewage Treatment Plant\". In the plant, natural bacterial breakdown of the sewage is assisted by clever recirculation of fluids, resulting in the discharge of a clean, clear and environmentally benign effluent.\n\n \n\nOil and Oily Waste \n\nThe discharge of oil at sea is illegal and is regulated by the International Maritime Organisation. All the Royal Navy warships are fitted with oil management systems to ensure against unwanted discharge of oil. \n\n\n\nWater and other liquids used in various processes on board RN ships is collected in tanks near the bottom of the ship and is known as \"bilge water\". Bilge Water cannot be discharged directly into the sea as it may contain oil and other harmful substances, such as detergents. \n\n\n\nThis \"water\" is circulated through Wastewater Treatment Machines, which clean it by either using an oil water separator, membrane filtration or both. The resulting cleaned and filtered water is then checked to ensure that it is safe to be discharged. \n\n\n\nMembranes act as a filter, allowing molecules or particles of a certain size to pass through, whilst retaining the larger ones. They are typically tubular of flat sheets and are made from polymers or ceramics.\n\n \n\nOil Water Separator Units consist of a vertical settling tank that allows free-floating oil to be skimmed off the surface of the liquid and disposed of or sent for recycling.\n\n \n\nThe separate module of stainless steel columns, housing tubular ceramic membranes, allows the remaining liquid to be passed through the membranes to remove emulsified oil and other contaminants. This process is known as cross-flow micro-filtration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Crown Copyright 2004. All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n",

          "news story | Brith Gof respond | from the Theatre in Wales web site\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n      \n        \n      \n      \t \n      Brith Gof respond\n\n    \n\t  \n\n    \t\n\t\n\tTo Mike Baker\n\nI am writing in response to the Draft Drama Strategy for Wales Consultation Paper with reference to Brith Gof.\n\n\n\nObviously we are disappointed that Council has made a provisional decision to fund the company for only six months of 1999 / 2000, and hope that when Council meet on 19 March they will reconsider.\n\n\n\nWe strongly believe that as an institution, as a body of work and group of artists, and as a company committed to innovation in Welsh language culture, Brith Gof deserves support and should be part of the strategy. \n\n\n\nThe Draft Strategy Document proposes to support innovation through project funding. We strongly believe that dependence on project funding is unsustainable for any company, our selves included, and the withdrawal of revenue funding from Brith Gof will therefore end Brith Gof's work in live performance in Wales.\n\n\n\nIn addition to which, none of the exciting and innovative applications for project funding put forward independently by any of the artists associated with Brith Gof, (Mike Pearson, Mike Brookes, Marc Rees, Sioned Hughes, Eddie Ladd), have received support.\n\n\n\nThe Draft Strategy confirms Council's commitment to ensuring full diversity of provision in both the languages of Wales. By both withdrawing funding from Brith Gof and failing to fund any of the artists listed above, or indeed proposing a franchise for work of this nature, Council are failing to deliver on their stated commitment.\n\n\n\nWe believe this clearly illustrates the limitations of a 'projects only' strategy. The Draft Strategy clearly concentrates resources within North and North East Wales. Brith Gof is one of the few companies regularly working in rural West Wales, and one of the very few companies in recent years to have had productions commissioned by promoters in Swansea, the valleys, and West Wales. \n\n\n\nAs such, Brith Gof is one of the few cultural institutions in Wales in a position to forge strategic alliances with other education and cultural providers, and take full advantage of the imminent arrival of Objective I status for much of South and West Wales.\n\n\n\nInternational contact and export success cannot be achieved overnight. To loose institutions such as Brith Gof will throw away eighteen years of investment in cultural relations. The role of the arts in promoting Wales internationally and in cultural and economic regeneration will both be important considerations in the coming decade. \n\n\n\nCouncil needs to rethink the means by which it achieves its priorities. Brith Gof can continue play a significant strategic role in delivering Council's objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTo: Jo Weston Chief Executive Arts Council of Wales\n\nI am writing in response to the Draft Drama Strategy for Wales Consultation Paper.\n\n\n\nI have separately written to Mike Baker with reference specifically to Brith Gof. \n\n\n\nThe following are the main points I wished to make. \n\n\n\n1. The consultation process.\n\nAlthough the consultation process began last year, the consultation period available for discussion of the Draft Drama Strategy is only roughly five weeks. Given that the strategy recommends very significant change I believe that five weeks is totally inadequate.\n\nMoreover, the timing of publication and consultation comes so close to the end of the financial year that, regardless of specific funding decisions, all clients will find it impossible to properly plan for 1999 - 2000.\n\nI am also both surprised and disappointed that the Arts Council of Wales apparently feels it unnecessary to engage in public debate within this current consultation period.\n\nAs far as I am aware, none of the companies mentioned within the strategy have been directly consulted as to the viability or desirability of the proposed changes in relation to themselves.\n\nBrith Gof were not consulted as to whether six months of funding is an appropriate level of within which to achieve anything. No indication has been given as to why the work of a particular company does or does not fall within the strategy, why a particular company will or will not be funded in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Geography.\n\nI have always understood that a fundamental principle of Arts Council funding is to ensure a good geographic distribution of resources. This principle appears to have been abandoned. The strategy appears to offer nothing to Swansea, Newport, the valleys, mid or West Wales. Such a geographic imbalance surely is deeply damaging\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Funding fewer better.\n\nThe principle of funding fewer was widely discussed during the consultation period last year, and I, like many, supported the principle. However, I did not envisage that the principle would be used to concentrate resources so heavily within such a small number of clients. In particular, I had assumed, wrongly as it appears, that funding for different categories of activity would remain relatively constant. \n\nThe strategy proposes a net reduction in funding to Theatre In Education, to Community Touring Theatre, to Experimental Theatre. It appears that everyone and every sector will suffer to in order to increase support to two newly expanded companies. For many, their only contact with professional live performance is through the work of TIE and Community Touring companies. To effectively deprive this audience of access to professional theatre is both culturally indefensible can only mitigate against the achievement of long term strategic aims; the development of new audiences, and the increasing importance of the arts within the wider cultural life of the nation.\n\nExperimental practise has been rightly compared to research and development within industry. A net reduction in funding to experimental companies, a reduced commitment to support for innovative and artistically and culturally challenging work will inevitably be deeply damaging within wider cultural debate and artistic practise. \n\nI am truly appalled that the proposal to withdraw funding from Brith Gof is not accompanied by a commitment to revenue fund another Welsh language experimental company. \n\nThe suggestion that revenue support for experimental work will be given to an English language company only clearly contradicts the strategy's stated aim of ensuring diversity across both the languages of Wales.\n\nGiven however that this has been proposed, why is the proposed grant increase for Volcano less than that currently given to Brith Gof? Surely, if Brith Gof is to be cut in order to ensure that Volcano can be better supported, Volcano should receive the full value of our grant in addition to their current award. \n\nThe strategy proposes an overall reduction of roughly £70,000 for experimental theatre. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Project Funding.\n\nOne of reasons why I have supported the principle of funding fewer better has been to ensure an increased budget for project funding. \n\nThe importance of project funding in supporting the work of independent artists and ensuring the development of new talent is enormous. Project funding is not however, and can never be, a substitute for revenue funding.\n\nThe belief that the work of companies such as Brith Gof or Hijinx can continue with project funding is entirely fallacious.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Welsh National Performing Arts Companies.\n\nFor me, this is the crux of my entire response.\n\nIt is from this that the entire strategy has been developed and all funding decisions made. It is clear that the strategy is proposing the creation of a National Theatre of Wales. \n\nSurely this is a matter for public debate and should rightly be a decision for the Assembly? Surely this is not a proper matter to be decided behind closed doors by a quango.\n\nIntrinsic to that debate is discussion as to the meaning and nature of a national theatre both now and in Wales, the role such an institution could / should play within the cultural life of the nation, and whether indeed the creation of such an institution is of value and benefit.\n\nDebate would therefore naturally broaden into the development of a cultural vision for Wales. Unless such a debate takes place and such a vision is clearly articulated, I fail to see how we can hope to develop an effective and coherent strategy according to which funding priorities can be set and individual funding decisions made.\n\nThe strategy fails to articulate such a vision. \n\nGiven everything I have listed above, I am sure you will not be surprised when I say I sincerely hope that Council will decide to reject the Draft Drama Strategy when it meets on March 19th. \n\n\n\n \n\tsource:\n\n    \t Brith Gof   \n\n      web site: \n\t \n      news written \n        by:\n\n    \tAlison Woods \n      \n      \n\n      e-mail:  \n      \n      \n\t \n      first posted \n        \n\n    \tThursday, February 25, 1999\n\t \n      \n\n    \t\n      \n\n\n\n",

In most cases, the symptoms are caused not by the organism itself, but by eating or breathing in the toxin. Botulism cannot be caught from an infected person. \n\nSymptoms often begin with blurred vision and difficulty in swallowing and speaking, but diarrhoea and vomiting can also occur. The disease can go on to problems with vision, and paralysis. Most cases will recover, but the recovery period can be many months. The disease can be fatal in 5-10% of cases; death is due to respiratory failure. Antitoxin is available which acts as an 'antidote' against the toxin; it must be given as soon as possible for best results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBotulism publications\n\n\n\nKey documents about botulism for health practitioners.\n Botulism publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBotulism useful links\n\n\n\nLinks to more information on botulism, including external websites.\n Botulism useful links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t            \nSecondary Navigation - links to other pages in this section\n\nCurrent section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and social care topics\n\n\nContains this content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol misuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthrax\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotic resistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntimicrobial resistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssisted conception\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBereavement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiotechnology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood\n\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\n\n\n\n\nBotulism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this main section:\n\n\n\n\nBotulism key documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther pages:\n\n\n\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren's services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChlamydia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical governance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicable diseases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControls assurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary Heart Disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptosporidiosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDental services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiphtheria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown's Syndrome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. coli O157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 A DAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood in Schools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoot and mouth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth clearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth inequalities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth care standards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare associated infection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy living\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHendra and Nipah viruses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer Majesty’s Inspector of Anatomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunisation infectious\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaternal and infant nutrition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegionnaires disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeptospirosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyme disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeningitis C  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder people's services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptical\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgan retention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutbreak plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPertussis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlague\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrison health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubella\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmonellosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallpox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial care\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialised services definition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStem cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstance misuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeenage pregnancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToxocariasis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToxoplasmosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuberculosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTularaemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Nile Fever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory committee on dangerous pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvises the Health and Safety Commission, the HSE, ministers and their counterparts under dvolution on all aspects of hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens.\nAdvisory committee on dangerous pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t            \nAuxiliary Links\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n© Crown copyright 2004\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n    \nGlobal Tools - quick links to useful sections\n\nAbout us\n\nSite map\n\nHelp\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch this site\nThis Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The site of the old cemetery is now a memorial park for Private Bunting - 22nd Bn Manchester Regiment who died 13 Dec 1918 aged 33; and private Crockson, 1st Bn Somerset Light Infantry who died 27 Jun 1917 - buried in Szawali (Schaulen) German Cemetary.\n\n\nKlaipeda Orphanage\n\n25 children from the Rytas Children's Home, Klaipeda (which has 91 children aged 4-19, most of whom will not be adopted) visited HMS Somerset on 30 May 03 for a children's party hosted by the ship's company. The visit was preceded by a press conference, before the party and presentation of some gifts on the flightdeck was made. On 2 Jun 03, 8 members of the ship's company made a return visit to the Rytas Home to deliver the rest of the donations, before continuing on to Giuilari Baby Orphanage in another part of Klaipeda to deliver much needed baby clothes, prams etc. These photographs are for the visit by the ship's company, their families and their friends and filled up a large part of the No2 Naval Store!\n\n\n\n\nTallinn - Orphanage\n\nA group of ship's company visited the Haiba Children's Home, 40 km from Tallinn, Estonia on 21 May 03 to present some of the children's clothes and toys which had been brought by the ship. Approximately 20 children/supervisors then returned to the ship for a return chidren's party. The CO, Cdr David Barker, also visited the home together with the Logistics & Supply Officer (LSO) Lt Cdr Katja Samuel (who coordinated all of the children's work for the 3 visits) and a female Estonian Naval Officer, Kersti Kelder, who was acting as our translator. The Haiba chidren's home has approximately 40 chidren from 0-17. In all of the chidren's home visits, a light coloured teddy bear can be seen - this was donated to the ship by the Mayor of Bath to take as many photographs as possible of where 'teddy' has been during the deployment as part of her fund raising efforts for the Royal United Hospital in Bath as well as to build a school for orphans in Bangladesh and link a school in Dessie, Ethiopia with a school in Bath.\n\n\n\nRiga\n\nIn Riga, Latvia, there was a children's party on board for the Ilgas Children's Home (25 May) followed by a return visit the following day (26 May), which also received local media attention (TV and newspapers).\n\n\nKotorHMS Somerset visiting Kotor, Serbia-Montenegro\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t?

The Government notes the case APCIMS and others in the financial industry make for this.\nStamp duty on shares is, of course, only one factor in selecting the location for a headquarters company. The UK is one of the most business friendly environments in the world and the benefits of locating in the UK include low rates of corporate and personal taxes and a network of over 100 tax treaties. There is no firm evidence to suggest that stamp duty is causing UK companies involved in overseas mergers to incorporate outside the UK.\nThe Government does, however, keep all aspects of the tax system under review and is happy to listen to views on this and other issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Links\n \n Millennium Lectures\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Prime Minister has hosted a series of lectures to mark the new millennium\n\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWatch our short films\nWatch government in action in our short films\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedia Centre\nPress briefings, PM press conferences and other resources are available in our Media Centre.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGuide to Legislation\nFind out how laws are made\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUseful Links\nUseful links to other government sites\n\n \n\n\n\n\n|\n\t\t\tcopyright | contact the webteam | website feedback | privacy policy | advanced search | sitemap | accessibility | rss feed | \n\n\n\n\n",

Between the 8-13 Jul, HMS Montrose was berthed at the Swedish Quay in Zeebrugge to support Belgian Navy Days. \n\n\n\nNine ships from six different Navies were represented and as well as the official receptions held by the naval base, many of the Ship’s Company took the opportunity to mix and host other crews from the eclectic collection of sailors in Zeebrugge for the weekend. The Ship was open to the public for 2 days and hosted over 4000 visitors from all over Belgium in what proved to be a very popular event.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Ship was in Belgium, the Ship’s Company took the opportunity to visit not only the local sights around Zeebrugge but also the many fascinating attractions in the nearby city of Bruges. \n\n\n\nTrips had also been organised by the Belgium Navy to Brussels and probably the most popular visit was to the In Flanders Fields World War I Museum at Ypres.  The highlight of this trip for many was the impressive memorial gate at Menin, where the names of over 54000 servicemen are engraved  – a commemoration to those who were never found. The photograph shows members of HMS Montrose Ship’s Company at the section where the soldiers of The Black Watch are remembered, which is one of the Ships’ affiliated regiments.\n\n\n\nBefore arriving in Zeebrugge the Ship had a very successful Sea Wolf missile test firing at sea off the south coast of England.  The Sea Wolf missile is HMS Montrose’s primary self defence missile and is capable of intercepting incoming missiles or attack aircraft with deadly accuracy and speed.  Three missiles were fired in total, all of which hit the target (which was towed 5 miles behind an aircraft).  \n\n\n\nAfter that success, and on the passage over to Belgium, in some really awful weather, the Ship’s Company participated in the Sports Relief Red Sock event in the Hangar.  Over 60 personnel rowed a mile for charity and as you can see from the photograph, it soon became very competitive, with OM Cuthill achieving the quickest time of 5mins 31sec.  If that was not enough, that evening Chief Lambert and Leading Physical Trainer Derbyshire hosted the first Montrose Bingo night.  Well supported by the Ship’s Company, the first winners shared a pot of over £200 and many are already buying tickets for what will be a regular event while at sea. \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Continued\nRead More ...\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t© Crown Copyright 2004.

The game played on AFC Barrow?s pitch in the centre of the town also gave the ship an opportunity to raise much needed funds for the Gym which provides a facility to provide exercise therapy for people who suffer from mental health problems and related issues.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough beaten 3-0 Bulwark?s team put up a good performance and raised ?150 for the Gym to buy training equipment and support the general maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeswick to Barrow Sponsored Walk\n\nOn Saturday 8th May eight members of the ship?s company and three support drivers took part in the 38th Keswick to Barrow Sponsored Walk ? a distance of 40 miles. It was an early and damp start for the team who had to be registered along with the other 1000 walkers by 0600.  First home from the HMS Bulwark team was MAA David Harris who ran the course and finished in just over 8 Hours.  The fastest competitor completed the course in less than 5 hours!  The entire Bulwark team members completed the course and raised approximately ?500 for the ship?s charities. The Bulwark team were joined in the event by four members of the medical staff from the ship?s adopted hospital in Bishop Auckland who were very useful in treating the many blisters acquired by the walkers!\n\n\n\nThe Toughest Footrace On Earth\n\nCaptain Andy Ward, the Officer Commanding the Landing Craft Troop on board HMS Bulwark was one of two Royal Marines who took part in the Marathon des Sables, billed as the ?Toughest Footrace on Earth?.  The annual event is a 152 mile staged footrace held over 6 days in Southern Morocco over the period 11 ? 17 April.  The race is divided into daily stages of between 11 and 50 miles across a variety of terrain (rocky, gravel, pebbles and of course sand!) which start at 0900 daily to ensure that racing takes place over the hottest part of the day, temperatures at times hovering around the 45 degrees Centigrade mark.  The most difficult part of the race for Captain Ward and his Royal Marine colleague Major Trit Leydon was a 36Km stage including 18km over sand dunes followed the next day by the longest stage of 50 miles.  Both Royal Marine officers finished in the top third of the 600 international competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tTop of page \n\n\t\t\tPrint \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t?

Growth overall in the year to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe first quarter was running at around 3% a year, still somewhat above\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlong-run trend. Inflation is currently running somewhat below our target of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2.5%. But cost pressures are still evident, particularly in the labour market,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand may be reinforced if the exchange rate continues to ease, as it has in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpast month. We need to remain vigilant, but, provided we take no risks with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprogress we have made in recent years in maintaining low inflation, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprospect is for continuing growth overall on a basis that can be sustained into\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe medium term.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t Mr Plenderleith stressed the importance of maintaining low\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinflation: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"Our first, and continuing, priority has to be to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to deliver the stable monetary framework - of interest rates directed\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat maintaining low inflation - as a platform on which commerce and industry\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthroughout the country can build their businesses and generate the growth in\n\t\t\t\t\t\toutput and employment the country needs if we are to prosper on a continuing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand sustained basis.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t However he recognised the unwelcome strains caused by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstrength of sterling, and noted the dilemma this posed for the MPC: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"… the effects have fallen most acutely on the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmanufacturing sector. The frustration felt by those who have built up efficient\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand competitive businesses, only to find their market position threatened by a\n\t\t\t\t\t\trise in the exchange rate over which they have no control, is entirely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstandable.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"In judging how far, and how fast, to moderate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic demand, we have taken into account the weakness of the UK's external\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsector, and the impact particularly on manufacturing, as an immediate factor\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffsetting in part the buoyancy of domestic demand. But we have also had to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttake into account the possibility further ahead that, if the exchange rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmoves back to more realistic levels, as we expect, the boost that could bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto external demand could only be accommodated, without strains on the supply\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcapacity of the economy as a whole, if domestic demand has moderated.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\t But he suggested that the exchange rate strains may now be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabating with the recent recovery in the euro: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"…it is reasonable to expect that the euro may\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin due course move back to more realistic levels; and that does indeed appear\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto have been happening in some part over the past month. Whether that will\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue is hard to judge, but there are reasonable grounds for believing that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome of the more extreme strains we have been experiencing from exchange rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovements may be abating.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t He touched on another, more positive, dilemma faced by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMPC, the ‘new economy’. Mr Plenderleith noted: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"The reason why these advances, if they are\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranslated into actual improvements in our economic performance, are so\n\t\t\t\t\t\texciting is that they represent scope for improvements in the supply side of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe economy: they hold out the possibility that the economy might be able to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrow faster than recent historical experience without jeopardising price\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstability.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t But added that caution was important here: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \"…it will be extremely important that we do\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot anticipate the process and begin to award ourselves the benefits before we\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave seen concrete evidence that they have been captured in improved economic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance.\" \n \n\t\t\t\t\t Mr Plenderleith concluded: \n \n\t\t\t\t\t “The job of the MPC is to deliver a platform of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing price stability so that business and industry across the country can\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontinue to deliver the goods and services the market place wants.” \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n \n\n \n\t  \n ",

The surveys are co-ordinated on a global basis by the Bank for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInternational Settlements (BIS), with the aim of obtaining comprehensive and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternationally consistent information on the size and structure of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding global markets. The Bank of England conducted the UK survey,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich covers the business of institutions operating within the UK in these\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarkets.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t Foreign exchange market turnover in the UK increased by 49%\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom April 2001 to April 2004. The volume of OTC currency and interest rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tderivatives business more than doubled over the same period. The UK remains the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle largest centre of foreign exchange activity with 31.3% of global\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturnover in April 2004: this share is broadly unchanged since the previous\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t The main findings of the UK survey are:\n \n\t\t\t\t\t \tAverage daily turnover in foreign exchange was $753\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  billion during April 2004, 49% higher than the $504 billion per day\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  recorded for April 2001, or a rise of 30% at constant 2004 exchange rates. This\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  growth has returned the level of turnover to beyond that seen during April\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  1998, more than offsetting the fall in turnover between April 1998 and April\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  2001. \n\tThe largest percentage growth between 2001 and 2004 was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  in outright forward transactions, (94%), followed by spot (47%) and swap\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  transactions (43%). Outright forward trades now account for 14% of total UK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  foreign exchange activity, compared with 11% in 2001.\n\tElectronic trading accounts for 55% of total foreign\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  exchange activity, and 67% of inter-dealer spot business (of which the majority\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  is via automated order-matching systems).\n\t Average daily turnover in OTC currency and interest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  rate derivatives was $643 billion during April 2004, compared with the $275\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  billion recorded for April 2001.\n\tThe growth within OTC currency and interest rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  derivatives was most pronounced in the OTC interest rate option market, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  saw turnover increase from $13 billion in April 2001 to $94 billion in April\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  2004, and now accounts for 15% of the overall OTC currency and interest rate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  derivatives market.\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t The December 2004 issue of the Bank of England Quarterly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBulletin will provide further analysis and more comprehensive statistics\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the UK.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t The BIS is publishing preliminary global results today (see\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe BIS\n\t\t\t\t\t\twebsite), with a detailed analysis to follow early in 2005. Central banks\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof many other countries are also publishing their own survey results; links to\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir websites can be found on the BIS website.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t Notes to Editors\n \n\t\t\t\t\t A total of 93 institutions, mainly commercial and investment\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbanks, participated in the UK survey. This was fewer than in previous surveys\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(for example, there were 253 participants in 2001), as only firms that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipate in the inter-dealer market and/or have an active business with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge customers were asked to complete the 2004 survey. Others active in the UK\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmarket were not directly involved in the survey, but their transactions with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tparticipating principals will have been recorded by those institutions.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t For the twenty business days in April 2004, participants\n\t\t\t\t\t\twere asked to provide details of their gross turnover in each market, broken\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdown in terms of specified categories of currency, transaction and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcounterparty. Gross turnover (measured in nominal values) is defined as the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tabsolute total value of all deals entered into during the month - i.e. there is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno netting of purchases against sales. Data were requested in terms of US\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdollar equivalents, rounded to the nearest million. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t The basis of reporting was the location of the sales desk of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe trade. This is a change from the 2001 survey where location was defined by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe location of the price-setting dealer. \n \n\t\t\t\t\t Turnover figures are published on a net basis. In the UK an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjustment is made for the fact that trades between participants in the UK\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsurvey will have been reported by both parties to the transaction; other\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries have also adjusted their data in this way. The BIS have, in addition,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjusted the global data for cross-border double counting prior to publication\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoday. Aggregating published national results would overstate global turnover\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to cross-border double counting.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\n \n\n \n\t  \n ",

They report to the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Andrew Turnbull.\nThe Strategy Unit\nThe Strategy Unit's aim is to improve Government's capacity to address strategic, cross-cutting issues and promote innovation in the development of policy and the delivery of the Government's objectives.\nThe unit was set up in 2002, bringing together the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU), the Prime Minister's Forward Strategy Unit (FSU), and parts of the Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS).\nThe unit has four main roles:\n\tundertaking long-term strategic reviews of major areas of policy;\n\tundertaking studies of cross-cutting policy issues;\n\tstrategic audit (occasional assessments of how well the UK, and UK government are doing); and\n\tworking with departments to promote strategic thinking and improve policy making across Whitehall.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Delivery Unit\nThe Delivery Unit is headed by Michael Barber and is responsible for ensuring that the Government achieves its delivery priorities, both across the key areas of public service (health, education, crime, asylum and transport) and in the other main domestic service delivery departments. Working closely with the Treasury, the Unit ensures that the departments have in place effective delivery plans for their Public Service Agreements and develops the framework, methodology and database for delivering these targets and identify training and development needs for civil servants involved.\nThe Delivery Unit reports regularly to the Prime Minister through the Minister for the Cabinet Office on progress on the delivery priorities of the delivery departments. It establishes the agenda for his regular stocktake meetings with the Ministers concerned; and also reports twice a year to the PSX Cabinet Committee. All departments remain accountable for meeting their PSAs through the PSX process.\nThe Office of Public Service Reform\nThe OPSR is headed by Wendy Thomson and focuses on reform of public services, such as the NHS, schools, police and local government. It has responsibility for:\n\tCommunicating the principles and values of public service reform and customer focus to the wider public service, and identifying and promoting best practice.\n\tModels for improving public service delivery by working with departments on more flexible structures, systems, processes, and ways of involving the private and voluntary sectors.\n\tPay and recruitment problems in the public sector.\n\tDeveloping systems for managing cross-cutting issues affecting service delivery, and improving links between departments and the wider public sector, including the use of e-Technology.\n\tDevising improved methods of public service management that reduce the impact of regulation on front-line services, working with departments and the Public Sector Team of the Regulatory Impact Unit.\n\nCorporate Development Group\nHeaded by Alice Perkins, this group spearheads the work on bringing in more talent, developing it better and raising the capability of Human Resource management throughout Whitehall. The component parts are:\n\tTalent: covering recruitment, career development, diversity, interchange and succession planning.\n\tLeadership Development and Skills: identifying the training and development needed in the Civil Service, and commissioning it.\n\tPay and Performance: developing pay, performance management and pensions systems and flexible retirement arrangements that support our wider objectives.\n\tModern People Management: making the way we manage people throughout Whitehall, in HR departments and in the line, more professional\n\tThe Centre for Management and Policy Studies, incorporating the Civil Service College, is a key provider and enabler of training and development, working with a range of outside institutions.\n\ne-Government Unit\nThe e-Government Unit works with departments to deliver efficiency savings while improving the delivery of public services by joining up electronic government services around the needs of customers.\nThe e-Government Unit's responsibilities include:\n\tstrategy: developing policy and planning for ICT within Government;\n\tarchitecture: providing policy, design, standards, governance, advice and guidance for ICT in Central Government;\n\tinnovation: providing high-level advice to Government bodies on innovative opportunities arising from ICT to improve efficiency;\n\tIT Finance: in partnership with OGC, monitoring major IT projects in Government and advising on major investment decisions (in partnership with OGC);\n\tIT HR: Head of the IT Profession in Government and leading its professional development;\n\tresearch: identifying and communicating key technology trends, opportunities, threats and risks for Government;\n\tsupplier Management: in partnership with OGC, managing the top-level relationship with strategic suppliers to Government (in partnership with OGC).\n\nThe e-Government Unit / CSIA also provides sponsorship of Information Assurance.\nThe Reform Strategy Team\nThe team is headed by Paul Kirby and has responsibility for:\n\tdefining the overall Civil Service reform strategy\n\tdeveloping the Departmental Change Programme\n\tsupporting the Civil Service Management Board\n\tcommunicating the reform message through the Civil Service\n\tThe Office of Government Commerce\n\nThe Office of Government Commerce\nThe Office of Government Commerce is part of the Treasury and is responsible for a wide-ranging programme to modernise procurement in government, and deliver substantial value for money improvements. The OGC's Chief Executive, Peter Gershon, is also a member of the Delivery and Reform Group with the remit of helping to improve the capability of the civil service to commission and deliver major projects.

She\nshe and Tamsin Gilbert did in India\nwas keen for us to send her research and any other things that\nwould be useful to guide nursing practice in the hospital.\nTamsin and I went to Salur, a town near the east coast of India\nwhere The Leprosy Mission (TLM) has a hospital with 125\nbeds of which 77 are for leprosy. We were met at Calcutta\nairport by a TLM worker and taken to the hospital for a few\nhours. My first impressions were vivid: a very distinct smell,\nthe clothing the people wore (we stood out blatantly from\neveryone else), it was raining but warm, the journey in the TLM\njeep - there seemed to be no organisation on the road and a lot\nof hooting! We had our first taste of the food and noticed the\nsmall lizards on the walls.\nWe were put on a train, travelling first class with air condition-\ning but I was very scared and held onto my luggage tightly for\nthe whole journey. This took 17 hours but we had beds, so got\nsome sleep. We were met, taken to another TLM jeep, regis-\ntered with the Superintendent of Police, and then had a two hour\njourney to Salur. Here we shared a basic but comfortable room.\nNursing\nThe first day we attended an eye camp. They selected over 30\npeople to have cataract operations the following week and these\nwere completed in one day by the same surgeon. For the first\nweek we took part in the Prevention of Disability Workshop.\nAbout 20 workers from TLM hospitals all over India came to\nSalur to have lectures and be examined. \nThe patients washed themselves or were helped by relatives.\nReliance on prayer\nThe equipment used was very basic and nothing was thrown\nI found coming to terms with the difference in culture and the\naway unnecessarily. Needles were rather blunt for giving injec-\ngreat poverty extremely difficult. Each day I had to rely on God\ntions! Very large pieces of gauze were cut and folded into the\nfor everything, which I hadn?t been used to. I found great help\nsmall squares by the staff.

Raising The Quality Of Social Housing\n\n\nChapter 7 of the Housing Green Paper 'Raising the quality of social housing' covers the following issues:\n\n\n  \t Encouraging more local authorities to consider the benefits of stock transfer;\n\t Supporting the transfer of up to 200,000 homes each year;\n\t Providing more detailed stock transfer guidance for local authorities;\n\t Enabling a transfer programme to extend over two financial years;\n\t Consultation on changes to the LSVT levy for the 2001 transfer programme;\n\t Introducing new Stamp Duty relief for registered social landlords;\n\t Conducting a review to consider further improvements to the transfer process;\n\t Introduce arms length management companies;\n\t Pilot the PFI for housing and consider future levels of support;\n\t Implement Best Value for Housing;\n\t Follow up recommendations of PAT5 and PAT7 on housing management;\n\t Ensure improvements through the Housing Inspectorate;\n\t Develop Best Value and Tenant Participation guidance for registered social landlords;\n\t Work up Housing Corporation proposals to support different types of resident control;\n\t Adapt the Housing Corporations regulatory framework to promote further efficiencies;\n\t Consider levels of investment in future years; and\n\t Introduce a new financial regime for local authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\tFigure 9Comments on 'Raising the quality of social housing'\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n415 respondents comment on Chapter 7 of the Housing Green Paper. Figure 9 shows the type of respondents commenting. 181 local authorities and 77 registered social landlords comment. Towards the lower end of the scale Individual respondents make up three per cent, Academics or Professionals make up two per cent and Councillors or MPs make up 1 per cent of those responding to the proposals on raising the quality of social housing.Figure 10 depicts the region that the respondent represents when commenting on raising the standard of social housing, 19 per cent are based in London, 14 per cent are based in the South East and 11 per cent are national representative agencies. The region with the least number of responses is Merseyside, which makes up 2 per cent of the total. However, as the total number of respondents to any aspect of the Green Paper is 13, the number responding on issues within Chapter 7 account for 54 per cent of all respondents from Merseyside.\n\n\n\n\tFigure 10Comments on 'Raising the quality of social housing' by Region\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSummary of views on 'Raising the quality of social housing\n\n1. 415 respondents comment on Chapter 7 'Raising the quality of social housing'. This represents 38 per cent of all respondents to the Housing Green Paper.\n\n2. Respondents are more likely to have concerns about the stock transfer process than support it. Fifty three per cent of the 261 respondents who explicitly comment on whether they support the stock transfer programme, express concern. The remaining 47 per cent actively support the programme.\n\n3. Only 17 respondents actively state support for the increase in the stock transfer programme to 200,000 homes per year.\n\n4. There is slightly more concern about the criteria of stock transfer, and the inclusion of an element of competition between new social landlords, than support for the criteria. Twenty five respondents have concerns compared to 14 respondents who support the criteria.\n\n5. Every respondents commenting on the extension of the stock transfer programme to 2 years are supportive (20 respondents comment on this proposal)\n\n6. Just over a fifth of respondents (21 per cent of those commenting on Chapter 7) share the view that stock transfer should be considered as one of a menu of options available to a local authority and its tenants to improve the condition of the stock.\n\n7. Almost half of respondents (49 per cent) state that local discretion is paramount and that tenant involvement is critical.\n\n8. Just under half (43 per cent) of the respondents comment on arms length companies, of whom 80 per cent are supportive of the proposals.\n\n9. A quarter (24 per cent) want to see the detail of arms length companies developed more.\n\n10. There is a broad welcome for the government's recognition of the size of the repairs backlog by 29 per cent of respondents. Increased funding is welcomed.\n\n11. Twenty one per cent of respondents to Chapter 7 want to see the discussion on local authority access to funding reviewed, to put authorities onto a level playing field with registered social landlords.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1 The stock transfer programme\n\n\nSupport for stock transfer\n\n\nThe Green Paper states the Government's intention to encourage more local authorities to consider the benefits of transfer both from a housing perspective and wider economic and social regeneration. Respondents are more likely to have concerns about the stock transfer process than support it. Fifty three per cent of the 261 respondents who explicitly comment on whether they support the stock transfer programme, express concern. The remaining 47 per cent actively support the programme.\n\n\nForty per cent of those agreeing are registered social landlords with 23 per cent being local authorities. Two are tenants groups with the rest being representative bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality and the Chartered Institute of Housing.\n\n\nFewer respondents comment on the detail of the proposed stock transfer programme, and where they do the level of support is often mixed. For example only 17 respondents actively state support for the increase in the stock transfer programme to 200,000 homes per year. \n\n\nEvery respondents commenting on the extension of the stock transfer programme to 2 years are supportive (20 respondents comment on this proposal) and 14 per cent would welcome further improvements to the stock transfer process. The latter group of respondents often suggested improvements, such as a stronger monitoring role for the local authority once the stock transfer has taken place, an option to transfer the stock back to the local authority where the new social landlord does not perform well, and a more active role for tenants in the decision making process.\n\n\nConcerns with the stock transfer programme\n\n\nLeaving the issue of who explicitly commented on supporting or disagreeing with stock transfer, a range of other comments are made. Concerns are voiced by 32 per cent of all respondents to Chapter 7. Of those expressing a concern two thirds make the point that stock transfer is just one option and it needs to be taken into consideration that tenants might choose to stay with the local authority. Tied to this is the issue of local democracy in that it is up to the tenants to decide whether to transfer. Half of the respondents think that local discretion and tenant choice is important when a local authority considers whether or not to transfer its stock. Forty five per cent of these respondents are local authorities. There is no significant regional variation to this response.\n\n\nWhat should happen if tenants decide not to transfer is debated by a number of local authorities. One view that sums up this is issue is that:\n\n\n'It is considered that in situations where tenants have not supported a transfer, or where an option appraisal has not identified any benefits for such a transfer, that the local authority should not be penalised through capital or revenue funding restrictions and thus be prevented from performing to the best of its ability.' (Tendring District Council)\n\n\nA few more local authorities and an MP expand on this point by asking what is so wrong about council housing that local authorities should be encouraged to transfer their stock.\n\n\nRelated to this is a concern from some registered social landlords about the difficulties existing registered social landlords have 'breaking in to the local authority market.' By this it is meant that many LSVT registered social landlords are those set up by the local authority to receive the stock and existing registered social landlords are by and large excluded from the process.\n\n\nIn developing this point further one registered social landlord is particularly concerned about how the flow of information coming from the local authority in the pre ballot stage is often designed to achieve the result the authority desired. They state:\n\n\n'Put simply we do not believe that the appropriate information will be provided and that most tenants will continue to be persuaded to vote in favour of transfer associations promoted by the local authority.' (Hyde Housing Association)\n\n\nTransferring up to 200,000 homes each year\n\n\nThe proposal to support up to 200,000 received very few comments. Seventeen respondents explicitly support the proposals while a further 15 express concern.\n\n\nConcerns centre on a number of issues. These can be summarised as:\n\n\n  \t Whether the proposed 12,000 dwelling limit is of sufficient size to give economies of scale;\n\t Whether there are potential Board members of sufficient calibre to make sit on the board; and \n\t Whether the proposed transfer programme will in fact create a registered social landlord based monopoly.\n\n\n\nThe argument about economies of scale is centred on current practice within the registered social landlord sector towards mergers and group structures. It is felt that the 12,000 limit conflicts with the move towards bigger more efficient registered social landlords. Interestingly a tenants group also call for the 12,000 limit to be increased but for the very different reason that the smaller level would split up the estate and mean that tenants could get a different level of service from different landlords on the same estate.\n\n\nStock transfer criteria\n\n\nThe Green Paper sets out the key criteria by which proposals for transfer will be considered and states further that the evaluation by a local authority on whether to transfer should be firmly grounded in the principles of Best Value. There is slightly more concern about the criteria of stock transfer, and the inclusion of an element of competition between new social landlords, than support for the criteria. Twenty five respondents have concerns compared to 14 respondents who support the criteria.\n\n\nThey main concern expressed relates to the element of competition proposed between registered social landlords, with some respondents seeing this as divisive.\n\n\nExtending the transfer programme over two financial years\n\n\nThe government believe that the requirement to complete the transfer within one financial year acts as a constraint against further stock transfer. The Green Paper proposes, therefore, that transfers can be extended over two financial years. Twenty respondents, predominantly registered social landlords or local authorities that have gone through a stock transfer explicitly state their agreement with the proposed two year extension.\n\n\nThe LSVT levy \n\n\nThe government does not propose to change the flat rate levy of 20 per cent on capital receipts arising from the sale of stock. The levy on preserved Right to Buy properties was scrapped on 1st April 1999. Seventeen respondents make reference to the levy with eight agreeing with the proposals and nine disagreeing.\n\n\nStamp Duty Relief\n\n\nOnly 10 respondents make reference to Stamp Duty, and all agree with the proposal and the listed exemptions.\n\n\nReviewing the stock transfer process\n\n\nFourteen per cent of respondents comment on the proposed review of the stock transfer process by suggesting improvements. Of those suggesting improvements one third are registered social landlords and a further quarter are local authorities. A number of suggested improvements are made including:\n\n\n  \t Improving the information available to tenants;\n\t Allowing greater flexibility in the size of transfers (the 12,000 limit);\n\t Putting all options available to a local authority (and its tenants) on an equal basis;\n\t Greater utilisation of existing registered social landlords and group structures to facilitate transfer; and \n\t Avoiding a two tier system.\n\n\n\nAbout 12 per cent of all respondents to this chapter suggest that transfer should be monitored on a long term basis to make sure that transfer are achieving real and measurable benefit. Among those making this comment are The Peabody Trust and the London Boroughs of Barnet, Greenwich and Islington and the Housing Corporation.Other respondents make the link between the rent restructuring proposals and proposals relating to the transfer programme and think that there is a contradiction in policy that needs to be reviewed. The argument is that the transfer programme could be stalled if LSVT registered social landlords have to adhere to RPI only rent increases, because it would make the business plan unviable (see Chapter 10).\n\n\nMonopoly landlords\n\n\nFourteen per cent of respondents commenting on Chapter 7 warn against the advent of monopoly registered social landlord providers. Commentators include registered social landlords. This it is stated would not be good for tenants. \n\n\n'The creation of more LSVT landlords may well lead to less consumer choice, and less efficiency as the new RSLs swamp existing players in the market, duplicate service provision and contribute to overheating in the local market for housing staff.' (Knightstone Housing Association)\n\n\nThe Audit Commission develops this view further and recognises that there could be conflicting aims:\n\n\n'There is clear tension between the need to increase competition and prevent large scale monopolies on one hand and the need to secure economies of scale in procurement and service delivery.' (The Audit Commission)\n\n\nThe Audit Commission, along with other respondents (South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council for example), warn against a 'two tier' system of stock improvement for local authorities where those that are 'excellent' go for the arms length company option and the LSVT route becomes 'second best.'\n\n\n7.2 Arms length companies\n\n\nThe Housing Green Paper gives local authorities the option of setting up arms length companies to manage its stock while retaining ownership. The Green Paper points out that a key feature of the initiative will be the ability to use more rental income to finance borrowing for investment in stock improvement. Only a small number of local authorities would be able to pursue this option and only those authorities that have demonstrated a high level of performance against Best Value targets, have demonstrated sound financial planning and provided a clear plan on rent restructuring will be considered.\n\n\nJust under half (43 per cent) of the respondents comment on arms length companies, of whom 80 per cent are supportive of the proposals. Nearly three quarters of which are local authorities and half of these are in London and the South East. Many of those welcoming the proposal state that the option will give local authorities and their tenants more choice in the future management of the stock.\n\n\nA number of observations and concerns are expressed and a quarter (24 per cent) want to see the detail of arms length companies developed more. Leicester City Council state that it will be important that extra funding for arms length companies is guaranteed, even if performance falls below performance standards. They advocate funding for a minimum of five years.\n\n\nTwenty one per cent of respondents to Chapter 7 express a view on whether the criteria for selection of arms length companies should include the criteria that only high performing local authorities should be able to create an arms length company. Of those commenting 86 per cent have concerns about limiting opportunities to high performing landlords only. One of the key arguments is that the decision of future ownership should be a local decision involving tenants and the local authority and that if it is decided that this is the best option then they should be allowed to pursue it. Others are concerned about how the 'high performers' are to be defined.\n\n\n10 per cent of all respondents comment that arms length companies should be created on a par with the stock transfer programme, in terms of size of properties included in the yearly programme, in terms of accessing private finance, and in terms of how tenant are involved. Respondents recognise that a ballot is a sensible way to gather opinion from tenants on whether they want to proceed with an arms length company. The issue of public accountability is also raised, which has been considered in Chapter 2 of this report.\n\n\nAn argument against arms length companies centred on local democratic control.\n\n\n'The creation of an arms length company will inevitably result in the loss or reduction of local democratic control over the management of council assets. The close relationship between local councillors and tenant representatives has been a keystone in achieving housing management practices which has led the council to be rated 'well above average' and also the awarding of three Charter Marks for Housing Management.' (Ipswich Borough Council)\n\n\nClarification is needed on the arms length proposal. The Abbey National point out that the Green Paper is sending out mixed messages about the ownership of social housing stock, and that clarity is needed, otherwise lenders may be reluctant to lend to registered social landlords. Their concern is that the Government appear to state that the best performing landlords will opt for arms length companies, with the second best option being stock transfer. This mentality will not please private financiers of stock transfer.\n\n\n7.3 The Private Finance Initiative (PFI)\n\n\nAn option for local authorities is the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Under the PFI local authorities enter into long term service contracts with the private sector to provide refurbishment, management, maintenance or repairs services. Providing the private sector takes a significant share of the risk, investment is not subject to public expenditure controls.\n\n\nUse of the PFI attracted comment from 18 per cent of respondents. Of these, three quarters agree with the principle of PFI. Ten respondents ask for more clarity on how extra capital resources for PFI are to be funded. Twenty one respondents state that it is important that tenants are involved in any discussion of future ownership or funding options. Five of these are tenant organisations.\n\n\nA few respondents express caution in the use of PFI until the results from the pilot authorities have been evaluated.\n\n\nRegistered social landlord board members\n\n\nThe issue of the calibre of RSL board members is mentioned by a few registered social landlords that are active in receiving local authority stock. These associations have noticed that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to attract people onto Boards. It is felt that this shortage could undermine the success of the LSVT programme in certain areas. Other registered social landlords point to skills shortages in housing management staff that again act as a constraint to transfer.\n\n\nIn response to this argument, however, Moat Housing Group state:\n\n\n'Greater use of existing housing association group structures for housing transfer may help overcome the potential skills shortages of staff and Board members.'\n\n\nWith respondent commitment to greater involvement of tenants in the future of their housing stock, regardless of the form of ownership, the issue of representative board members will become increasingly apparent in the future.\n\n\n7.4 Best Value and Tenant Participation Compacts\n\n\nThere is strong support for the principles of Best Value within the overall context of funding decisions. One quarter of respondents explicitly make reference to Best Value. These are a mix of registered social landlords, local authorities, tenant groups and national representative agencies.\n\n\nA similar proportion of respondents (and a similar mix of type) agree with the need to frame consultation within the Tenant Participation Compact structure.\n\n\nSeventeen per cent of respondents explicitly stated that they agree that registered social landlords should be subject to an inspection process similar to that used under Best Value for local authorities. One third of those agreeing are registered social landlords and a further third are local authorities. Others agreeing include the Federation of Black Housing Organisations, The Institute for Public Policy Research and the National Housing Federation.\n\n\nA small number of respondents (21) state that they welcome further guidance from the Housing Corporation on Best Value and Tenant Participation Compacts.\n\n\nMany respondents (15 per cent of all responses) make reference to the need to involve tenants more generally in decision making, whether that be related to stock transfer, more general elements of service delivery or resident control of estates. Many respondents point to what they see as existing good practice and think that there is more that others could do.\n\n\nAll of these respondents see benefits in involving tenants more directly in both provision of services and in managing their estates.\n\n\nA small number of respondents comment on the need to adapt the Housing Corporation's regulatory framework to promote further efficiencies in management and responsive to tenants by registered social landlords. Eight respondents welcome the adaptation. \n\n\n7.5 Recommendations from Policy Action Teams' 5 and 7\n\n\nTwenty four respondents explicitly endorse the findings of Policy Action Team (PAT) 5 and PAT 7 and welcome the increased resources for housing management and on the spot housing management techniques.However, many more respondents (133 in total) raise the general issue of the need to link proposals in the Housing green Paper with recommendations stemming from other policies on regeneration, low demand and social exclusion, including the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal which encompasses recommendations from the PATs (See Chapter 3).\n\n\n7.6 Future investment\n\n\nThe reference in the Green Paper to reviewing the level of future investment in social housing particularly to fund the repair backlog received much comment. This area attracts comment from 30 per cent of respondents, two fifths of whom are local authorities. Respondents welcoming the review do so in the context of the government's own estimates of £19 billion repairs backlog. Many local authorities in their response also make reference to repairs backlog locally and how the gap between what is needed and what has been allocated in the past has widened. This is one area where the welcome is very much upbeat (one respondent saying it is a 'miraculous' admission by the government).\n\n\n7.7 New financial regime for local authority housing\n\n\nThe proposed changes to local authority Housing Revenue Accounts (HRA) have been subject to a separate consultation exercise and very few respondents make comments within their response to the Housing Green Paper. Of those that did, 12 welcome the change but eight express concerns mainly centred on the specific aspects of the HRA changes.\n\n\n7.8 Ideas suggested\n\n\nRespondents raise other ideas that could be considered in the development of the proposals, including:\n\n\n  \t Local authorities should be able to sell homes more freely and keep the capital receipts;\n\t Local authorities should be able to access finance on the same basis as registered social landlords.\n\n\n\n\n\tKey links to Chapter 7\n\nCreating a level playing field; tenure neutrality; Tenant Choice; long term planning; linking with the wider context; Making it work locally, the Challenges ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSee also:\n\n\t\t\tQuality and choice: a decent home for

He said:\n\n  \n\n'I welcome the UN report released today.  The report confirms what I saw first hand during my visit to Darfur last week and is in line with my discussion with Mr Pronk in Khartoum.  There has been some progress in Sudan over the past 30 days, including improvements in the humanitarian situation and limited disarmament of the Popular Defence Force.  But we need to see much more.'\n\n\n\n'The Government of Sudan is still not doing enough to disarm the militias.  A culture of impunity continues, with no evidence that the perpetrators of these appalling attacks are being brought to justice.'\n\n\n\n'I believe that the modest improvements to date have come about primarily because of the pressure exerted by the international community.'\n\n  \n\n'We will now want to listen to the Special Representative's presentation to the Security Council, and discuss his recommendations urgently with Security Council partners.'\n\n\n\n\n\nSudan Country Profile\n\nThe United Kingdom in the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To find out more about the African Union, please visit www.africa-union.org. \n\n\n\nWe are also supporting the conflict management capacity of a number of sub-regional organisations.

We are working with ECOWAS and international partners to identify further areas of support. We are also providing substantial support to the development of the West African Standby Brigade (WASBRIG), funding provision by the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre of advice and research on doctrine, training, concepts and planning.\n\n\n\nIn eastern Africa we are supporting the efforts of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) to create the Eastern Africa Standby Brigade (EASBRIG).

(Please read Security and General Tips and Risk of Terrorism when Travelling Overseas page for further information and guidance.\n\n\n\nCrime\n\n\n\nCrime rates in Cape Verde are low but you should take precautions and avoid carrying valuables in public and remain vigilant at all times.\n\n\n\nPolitical Situation\n\n\n\nThe political situation is stable.\n\n\n\nRoad Safety\n\n\n\nTraffic is usually light and road conditions and driving standards are generally of a reasonable quality.\n\n\n\nSea Safety\n\n\n\nSea conditions around Cape Verde are sometimes treacherous (there are also many submerged rocks). Mariners should take local advice. Travel by sea to the southern islands of Fogo and Brava in particular can be significantly disrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENTRY REQUIREMENTS\n\n\n\nBritish nationals require a visa to enter Cape Verde. Cape Verde is represented in the UK by the Honorary Consul Mr Joao Roberto. He can be contacted at 18-20 Stanley Street, Liverpool L1 6AF (tel: 0151 236 0206; fax 0251 255 1314; e-mail: joao.Roberto@capeverdeconsul.com or contact the Cape Verde Consulate in Rotterdam, Mathenesserlaan 326, Rotterdam 3021 HX; (tel: +31 10 477 8977; fax: +31 10 477 4553). For those travelling via Senegal there is a Cape Verde Embassy in Dakar. Specialist travel agents dealing with Cape Verde can also arrange visas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEALTH\n\n\n\nWe strongly recommend that you take our comprehensive medical and travel insurance before travelling. This should include cover for medical treatment and evacuation, accidents, cancelled flights, and stolen cash, cards, passports and luggage.\n\n\n\nYou should seek medical advice before travelling and ensure that all appropriate vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\n\nFor further information on health, check the Department of Health’s website at www.dh.gov.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL\n\n\n\nThe Cape Verde Escudo is tied to the Euro at CV Esc 110.27 = 1 Euro.

If you have a particular question to ask, you may contact the Regimental Recruiting Team and put your question to them. \nWhere is 5th Regiment RA located?\n5th Regiment RA is located at Marne Barracks, Catterick in North Yorkshire. Marne Barracks is located right next to the A1, signposted clearly on both the northern and the southern carriageways. Because of the camp's location it has excellent communications routes both south and north. London is only 4 1/2 hours away, and Edinburgh is 2 1/2 hours north.\n\nWhat Towns are nearby?\nThe largest towns within one hour's drive are Newcastle and Middlesborough to the north and York and Leeds to the south. Closer in are the towns of Darlington  and Northallerton, both within 25 mins drive. Richmond and Catterick Garrison are 10 minutes drive away; there's a Tesco, sports shops and military equipment shops in the Garrison and Richmond has all the normal shops for a small town. If it's a quick trip to the shops you want there's Catterick village five minutes walk down the road.\n\nWhat entertainment and recreational facilities are in the area?\nMarne Barracks: There are a number of entertainment facilities on camp; a NAAFI bar with Spar shop; a particularly comprehensive PRI Shop; Hair Dressers and evening sports classes in the gymnasium. The Gymnasium is a brand new state of the art facility, which is open until 9.00pm and open at the weekend as well.\n\nCatterick Village: As already mentioned the village is a short walk from Marne Barracks and comprises a number of small shops, which include a Post Office, garage, bakers and a cafe. There are a few Public Houses, the most popular being the Angel Hotel which is most frequented by soldiers and locals. For those after a late night snack there is a fish and chip shop, kebab/pizza shop and a chinese take-away. North of the village is Catterick Racecourse, this holds a large open market on Sundays and on Public Holidays.\n\nCatterick Garrison: Catterick Garrison sits on an elevated plateau 4 miles west of the A1 and 2 miles east of Richmond. The Garrison consists of some 2,400 acres of land with the surrounding training areas of Feldom and Bellerby adding a further 19,000 acres. Together with Catterick Training Area, the Garrison has responsibility for about 34 square miles of land, which represents a sizeable slice of North Yorkshire.\n\nThere are 19 separate barrack complexes within Catterick Garrison. There is accommodation for over 6,000 single service personnel and nearly 2,153 married quarter's spread across 22 Estates. Catterick Garrison is in many respects unique amongst military garrison towns. It is virtually self-sufficient; it has its own infrastructure, owning and operating its own water supply system, high Voltage electricity ring mains and is of course responsible for all its property and estate maintenance.\n\nThe Garrison has recently completed a period of expansion, major rebuilds and troop movements which has increased the number of military units, personnel and families accommodated in the Garrison. Catterick is now the largest military garrison in the British Army. The Garrison lies within the boundaries of Richmondshire District Council and has developed extremely close links at all levels of the Parish, Town, District County Government and the emergency services.\n\nCatterick Garrison is always a hive of activity; there is an assortment of Public Houses that include fun pubs, a nightclub and two families clubs. There are countless military and civilian clubs and associations about the Garrison, sporting activities varying from horse riding to clay pigeon shooting.\n\nLocal Area: If you are the type to go sightseeing then the Richmond Tourist Office has a wide and varied choice of leaflets free of charge, all advertising places of interest, as the area is rich with castles, monasteries, medieval ruins and many well-preserved manor houses. Above all, the district possesses a wealth of churches that still reflect their grandeur and architecture.\n\nThe area has so much to offer. On the doorstep are the Yorkshire Moors with scenic views and forest parks, which are extremely popular in the spring and summer months. The sea is about an hour's drive away with resorts such as Scarborough and the historic fishing village of Whitby. To the west is the Lake District again about an hour's drive. There are many small towns and villages in the surrounding area, which provide you with a base for scenic walks, all of these are clearly marked and follow Public footpaths and Bridle ways. These areas also have a number of pubs, which often have bar meals available throughout the day, and evening. They will provide you with free car parking for the duration of your walk.\n\nWhat Public Transport is in the Local Area?\nA regular bus service operates from just outside Marne Barracks/Catterick Village to the market towns of Richmond, Northallerton, and Darlington via the surrounding villages.  Local taxi services are also available. The nearest train station is in Darlington, which is on the mainline going north and south. There is also a small station in Northallerton. There are three airports within an hour of the camp, Newcastle Airport, Teeside Airport, and to the south Leeds/ Bradford Airport.\n\nWhere's the Nearest Bank?\nThere is a Link cash machine on camp in the NAAFI shop. There are also various banks in Catterick Garrison; Lloyds TSB, HSBC and a number of additional cash machines as well. Richmond, approximately 2 miles from the Garrison has the majority of the major banks and building societies. Darlington, approximately 15 miles away, has all the banks and building societies you would expect in  a main town.\n\nWho's on the Camp?\nTwo Regiment's, 5th Regiment Royal Artillery, and 8 Regiment Royal Logistics Corp share Marne Barracks. These Regiment's share most of the facilities; the Gymnasium, the Regimental restaurant and both the Sergeants' and Officers' Messes. This means there is approximately 1000 personnel working on camp, however this is a bit false as there are normally several sub-units away at any one time on tours, exercise etc.\n\nWhat's the Accommodation Like?\nCurrently the accommodation on camp is of poor quality, but during 2004 the rebuild of the accommodation is due to start with brand new single man en suite rooms. Until this time the single accommodation varies, there are a number of single man rooms  but some are up to four man rooms, normally with two or three living in those rooms. The family's accommodation is all of a good grade with garages available.\n\nWhat's the Food Like?\nThe food is high quality. There is a wide choice on the menu at each meal. There's normally soup, sandwiches and a choice other than chips at lunchtime and a variety of meats in the evening. As already mentioned the Cookhouse is shared with 8 Regiment RLC.\n\nWhat are the Sports Facilities Like?\nThe camp has a brand new gymnasium with a comprehensive weights room, large gym floor and sauna. There are several sports pitches on the airfield and these get used frequently by both Regiment's sports teams. There are many other sports available in the surrounding area; there's a swimming pool in the Garrison and a couple of civilian gymnasiums in Richmond. If you travel to Darlington there are all the sports facilities anyone could want.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of 5 Regiment RA encourages all soldiers to participate in all sports at all levels, from representing the Battery teams through to representing Joint Service (Army, Royal Navy and RAF) teams.\n\nWhat are the Parking Facilities Like?\nEach Battery's accommodation has nearby designated parking areas with enough space for everyone. There is some parking outside each Battery's offices, however these are normally reserved for the Officers and Senior Ranks within these Batteries.\n\nWhat Education Facilities are Available?\nWithin Catterick Garrison there is a comprehensive Army Education Centre, including Internet facilities and the ability to gain a wide variety of civilian qualifications. Also within the Garrison there is a Darlington College facility. Within this college you may gain any number of qualifications from GCSEs to IT based qualifications via Learn Direct.On Marne Barracks, Darlington College have a learning suite where you can gain access to the Internet and also civilian and IT qualifications.\n\nWhat Hours Do We Work?\nThe normal working day begins at 08.30hrs and goes through to 16.30hrs. Monday and Tuesday are normal working days, Wednesday morning is spent on the vehicle park working on the vehicles and in the afternoon everybody plays sports, be it at Regimental level or just a kick around in the gym. Thursday again is a normal working day. Friday we finish work at 12.30hrs, normally after the Commanding Officer's run. The weekend is generally your own unless you are on duty or on exercise.\n\nWhat's the Travel Like in the Regiment?\nThe Regiment as a whole has great opportunities to travel both in work and adventure training. In the past few years there is a great list of countries visited by members of the Regiment, some of which are listed below:\n\n\n\tAustralia\tBosnia\n\tOman \tCanada\n\tNorway\tUSA\n\tKosovo\tNorthern Ireland\n\tSlovenia\tKenya     \n\tMacedonia\tCyprus     \n\tAlbania\tGreece\n\tPoland \tTurkey     \n\tBelize\tAscension Islands\n\tGermany\tSouth Africa\n\tBrunei\tFrance     \n\n\n\nObviously not everybody gets to go everywhere, but by joining the Regiment, you may get to travel to a great many of these countries.\n\nSummary.\nThe Regiment is unique within the British Army.  It has a wide variety of trades you can gain if you take up the challenge.  There is opportunity to travel both operationally and on Adventure Training.  The camp is ideally placed for travel both North and South at the weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tCONTACT US\nIf you would like any further information about 5 Regiment Royal Artillery please contact the Regimental Recruiting Team at recruiting@5regtra.mod.uk\n\n\n \n\t\t\t  \n              \n\t\t\t  \n              \n              \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n              \t\n\tArmy \n                    Home > Privacy \n                    Statement > \n                    Copyright \n                    > Liability \n                    > Contacts\tBack^Top \n                  \n\t \tTo contact \n                          the author of this page select Page Properties to view \n                          their details\t  Last \n                          Reviewed: 8 Nov 04 \n                           \n\n\n\n\n              \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This will help close the famous democratic deficit which the EU has yet to solve - though the referendum campaigns based on facts and reality, not the myths and distortions of the anti-European press will also help. We need to shape what I call a P2P - Parliament to Parliament, Politician to Politician, Party to Party - approach to Europe. \n\n\n\nThis will mean a new role for national parliaments and the Commons should take a lead in creating parliamentary networks in Europe. Jack Straw has put forward important proposals to create a grand committee for Europe to allow UK parliamentarians to have an increased say in shaping and scrutinising EU policy. MPs and their committees need to hold meetings in Brussels and other national capitals to take British arguments and promote British interests across Europe as well as understand better the national and European priorities of 24 other EU member states.\n\n\n\nThe 78 UK members of the European Parliament must work collaboratively with the elected British government and its 408 Westminster MPs.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately some MEPs have boasted they want to 'wreck' Europe which means they will be no help to British companies, trade groups, British unions, the financial services industry, British NGOs, British local government leaders, British voluntary groups and other representative bodies who want allies and partners in the European Parliament not self-styled wreckers. Equally some other British MEPs who support the isolationist anti-EU line share these views or use their membership of the European Parliament to indulge in petty posturing for domestic political consumption.\n\n\n\nThis puts further onus on Britain's national parliamentarians to take a responsible leadership role in defending and defining Britain's place as a leading European nation. The new constitutional treaty allows us all to say Yes or No to Britain's position in Europe. It allows us to say Aye or No to the enhanced role for the House of Commons and other national parliaments which is an important element of democratic control in the new Europe the UK is seeking to build.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritain and the European Union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current Speeches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "Foreign & Commonwealth Office News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Full Graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW DETECTION EQUIPMENT TO STOP DRUGS ARRIVING BY POST\n\n\n(18/03/04)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITED TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERVIEW GIVEN BY FCO PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY, BILL RAMMELL, TO BBC RADIO 4, THURSDAY 18 MARCH 2004\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nCustoms officers are going to be introducing new equipment which will scan all mail bags arriving in this country from Jamaica because of an apparent increase in the amount of cocaine being sent here in the post.  Mr Rammell, are these new scanners going to solve the problem of drugs arriving by mail?\n\n\nBILL RAMMELL:\n\nI think it's part of the solution.  I think we need to remember when we are dealing with the drugs industry, it's ingenious, it's illegal, it's well resourced and when we block off one route it will try to develop another.  The thing that gives me confidence and I was in the Caribbean the week before last meeting with Caricom National Security Ministers is that there is a determination on both sides to really make a difference.  We've done that with the ion scanners at the airports which have had a huge impact on stopping the drug mules.  But there is a determination as well to look at other issues.  We were discussing training assistance that we can give, intelligence and information sharing, maritime co-operation.  But we also really do need to be looking at the postal service and we are doing that and developing the technology to try and help them.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nOn the question of these mules, you make the assertion that it's been a very successful fight against this.  Does that mean that you are checking everybody who gets on a plane and you're confident that if anyone has swallowed cocaine you will pick it up?\n\n\nBILL RAMMELL:\n\nNo, I actually saw the operation of the ion scanners myself and they do it on an opportunistic basis.  They will scan people where they identify that there is a potential problem with cocaine, they then take people to hospital and actually deal with it in that way.  And as I say, if you look at the figures, it has actually reduced the incidence of people trafficking cocaine in that way by about eighty or ninety percent.  But you need a solution across the board and that is what we're trying to do.  The reason that I was in the Caribbean was actually at the request of the Caricom Prime Ministers who made the request to our Prime Minister Tony Blair back in December and I think that demonstrates that they're determined to tackle the problem.  But it's also our mutual interest.  I mean this is an area where foreign and domestic policy comes together.  A huge amount of the cocaine that comes from South America is trafficked through the Caribbean and then hits our streets.\n\n\nQUESTION:\n\nPresumably it is very difficult to devise a system that will check all the mail coming in because it could be sent through a third country?\n\n\nBILL RAMMELL:\n\nYes.  And in modern government and politics you don't want politicians suggesting that everything is easy.  And when you are dealing with an illegal industry such as this, you block off one route and then they'll look for another.  And therefore we need to be looking at every part of the solution.  We are certainly doing that with maritime co-operation, sharing intelligence, we have been using the ion scanners, we are developing the technology to look at the postal service.  We have got to be looking at other trafficking routes whether that is coming via Africa or going through the Continent of Europe.  I've got confidence that there is a real political determination but we are dealing with a very changing, very ingenious illegal industry and we've got to keep one step ahead of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about drugs and international crime...\n\nSee also the Caribbean section of this site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to current News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
