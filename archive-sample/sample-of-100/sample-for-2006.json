But in the last 3-4 weeks I have noticed a lump on the lower part of my gum. It does not hurt and it is pink like my gum. It's fairly firm and it does not hurt when I press it (unless I press hard).\n\nI have also noticed my saliva production has increased, but I am think that may be down to anxiety.\n\nThis lump is about 2-3 cm long and protrudes about 5 mm which makes my lower cheek bulge slightly.\n\nWhat could it be and should I trouble my doctor with it (I sort of know the answer to that already)?\n\nThank you - Greg\n\n\n\t \t\n\tPosts: 7 | Location: Leicester | Registered: 21 May 2004\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nPaulineT\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted \n23 May 2004 02:48 AM\n\n\n\n\nHi Greg\nGo the docs on Monday - you know what to do so stop procrastinating...... As a former sufferer of this area you can I think be demanding about getting a ENT consultant appointment within 2 weeks. My GP phoned the hospital as I left his room and got me an appointment just 9 days later.\n\nI am concerned about the size of your lump and about the excess saliva you mention. For about 9 months prior to the diagnosis I started to wake up with a a drop or two of saliva at the corner of my mouth. It had never happened before ever.\n\nAt first it was once about every 3 weeks then it increased to two weeks then to weekly and by the time of my op it happened every other day or so.\n\nI have come across one other person who told me they had this as a symptom. It stopped after surgery, but happened about once just before radiotherapy and then stopped again. \n\nYou must check this out. Let us know. I want it to be harmless for you. We all have delayed at some point not quite believing we could be one of the statistics.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\t \t\n\tPosts: 323 | Location: Worcestershire, England, UK | Registered: 10 June 2003\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nVicki Lynn\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted \n23 May 2004 07:51 PM\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE DO GO GREG,, THERE IS NO SENSE IN DELAYING OR PUTTING THIS OFF ANOTHER DAY, GO FIND OUT WHAT IS WHAT,,THEN GO FROM THERE,, PLEASE KEEP US INFORMED,,,WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER THRU THIS,,,,BE STRONG,, BE BRAVE,,GO, GO, GO , ALWAYS VICKI LYNN\n\n\n\t \t\n\tPosts: 591 | Location: Las Vegas | Registered: 15 May 2004\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nGreg\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted \n24 May 2004 05:36 AM\n\n\n\n\nThank you Pauline and Vickie.\n\nYes, I had already talked myself into going on Monday to my doctors, even if it is nothing to worry about, I of course do need to know.

As Pikeman says we are all frightened when we get diagnosed. As pikeman also says that feeling doesn't go away, but we are all in this togeather so we help each other. If you read my diary about when I was diagnosed you will see you are not any more frightened than I was. As you say the outcome from you apointment might not be as bad as you think.\nKeep us informed \nMaurice\n\n\n\t \t\n\tPosts: 143 | Location: Nelson Lancashire UK | Registered: 23 April 2004\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nPaul\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted \n08 July 2004 03:18 PM\n\n\n\n\nHI Greg, Brave NOT     \n\"\"\"Cowards get Cancer Too\"\"\"    \nme one of the biggest    \nI wish you all the look for you appointment with Max fax and let us know what happens\n\nCheers\npaul\n\n\n\t \t\n\tPosts: 481 | Location: London England | Registered: 06 March 2003\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \tPrevious Topic | Next Topic \tpowered by groupee community\t \t \n\n\n\n\t\t Please Wait.

These are the key milestones for the MRD programme and reaching \n        them will be a huge achievement for all staff and partners involved, not \n        least those continuing to deliver vital services to customers while preparing \n        for the organisational changes. But we're not there yet. There is lots \n        more still to do in the last few weeks, particularly to ensure that all \n        our staff know what they will be doing and that they and our stakeholders \n        have all the information they need.

The review \n        is intended for everyone working in, and with an interest in, rural areas. \n        It sets out the standards for 11 core services for the rural public, including \n        education, health and social care, provision of broadband, transport, \n        postal services and emergency services.\n\n      Following feedback from readers, the 2006 edition is much more about \n        ‘real people and real issues’ and as a consequence the publication \n        is intended to be more balanced and informative. The ‘Did you know’ \n        section has been expanded with the inclusion of more targeted signposting \n        around all the key case studies. The topics are more reflective of the \n        concerns facing rural communities today and describe some innovative ways \n        communities have addressed these issues. The aim is to inspire more people \n        to take those first steps to understand and address the needs of their \n        own communities.\n\n      A copy of the report (www.defra.gov.uk/rural/pdfs/services/rural-services-review-2006.pdf) \n        can be found on Defra’s Rural Services internet pages\n\n        (www.defra.gov.uk/rural/services)\n\n      Programme People\n\n      This \n        month we have been talking to Steve Heaton from the Northwest Development \n        Agency (NWDA).\n\n      Steve has been spearheading the development and implementation of the \n        Agency’s rural affairs policy and delivery in the North West for \n        three years. His main responsibility has been to implement the NWDA’s \n        £100 million Rural Renaissance Programme, in order to make a major \n        contribution to rural development within England’s Northwest.\n\n      i) How have you and your team been anticipating taking on the new socio-economic \n        work in October?\n\n      The work has a number of components from our perspective. There is a \n        significant amount of internal activity with a cross agency team involved. \n        That team is looking at all the business process implications of taking \n        on the socio-economic work.\n\n      In parallel to that the rural team has been leading on the development \n        of the new programme for the region. NWDA has a strong sub-regional emphasis \n        and we have asked the sub-regions to work out what the key priorities \n        are for them. Each has to do this within the framework of the measures \n        available under the regulation, the steer from the strategy consultation \n        and the priorities in the Regional Rural Delivery Framework and the Regional \n        Economic Strategy. These various sources give a pretty clear steer to \n        sub-regions as they identify their own priorities. We have a significant \n        interest in delivery using the Leader methodology and expect that to form \n        a major part of delivery of Axes 1 and 3. \n\n      ii) How do you see devolution to the regions impacting on rural development?\n\n      It provides an important opportunity for the region and, in the case \n        of NWDA, the sub-regions to establish priorities. The development of Regional \n        Rural Delivery Frameworks has brought partners together and helped generate \n        a better shared understanding of each others’ priorities. That shared \n        understanding is of enormous benefit when rural development is being planned \n        and implemented. \n\n      iii) What differences will your customers notice over the coming year?\n\n      Our customers are likely to be sub-regional partners who will be undertaking \n        delivery on our behalf. We hope to use existing structures wherever possible \n        and this should provide a high degree of continuity for final beneficiaries.\n\n      iv) What’s your top priority in the region at the moment?\n\n      Rural Renaissance, a £100m investment programme by NWDA, is in \n        its fourth year of a five year delivery plan. Inevitably the early years \n        of such a programme focus on capacity building and development work. Pressing \n        ahead with agreed delivery is the key objective over the remainder of \n        the programme. The bulk of the investment is being made in the final two \n        years of the programme.\n\n      v) When you think about your role in the RDA since you joined in 2003, \n        what stands out the most?\n\n      The strengthening of the devolution agenda. NWDA was at the forefront \n        of developing a region wide rural strategy which was, in many ways, a \n        forerunner of Regional Rural Delivery Frameworks. I think that the NWDA \n        model influenced both the Haskins report and Rural Strategy 2004 and gave \n        confidence that devolution of strategy and delivery to regional and sub-regional \n        level could work. I think this has represented a very significant change \n        of emphasis.\n\n      vi) What’s been the most challenging part of the MRD reforms to \n        date? What opportunities have you gained either now or that you see coming \n        in the future?\n\n      Getting partners to understand that the changes were not simply about \n        a different organisation doing what its predecessor had done. Looking \n        ahead, I think that how we achieve, in a practical and meaningful way, \n        integration of delivery across the three delivery axes of the Rural Development \n        Regulation is going to be a challenge.\n\n      The major opportunities from MRD are better alignment of funding, a co-ordinated \n        strategic approach across all pillars of sustainable development and a \n        reduction in duplication. We have also been able to build on some of the \n        piloting work of the Countryside Agency and expand some activities across \n        the region. Wheels2Work is a good example.\n\n      vii) What’s your experience so far, and hopes for, partnership \n        working with Natural England and the Commission for Rural Communities?\n\n      The regional devolution agenda has been embraced by many partners but \n        how Natural England is able to embrace it will be important. I hope that \n        there will be significant regional autonomy so that public sector interventions \n        can be focused to achieve best results. \n\n      Working with the CRC has been limited thus far given that it has a small \n        regional presence. It is however a productive relationship and we are \n        hoping to be able to provide accommodation for a member of CRC staff in \n        one of our offices. On a practical basis this would help ensure a continuing \n        close relationship. \n\n      EFRA Committee Inquiry – the potential of England’s Rural \n        Economy\n\n      EFRA, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, has decided \n        to undertake a new inquiry – The Potential of England’s Rural \n        Economy. The aim is to highlight the potential of England's rural economy: \n        what could be achieved and the barriers to achieving it. The Committee \n        is going to build on recent parliamentary scrutiny of the MRD reforms \n        – in 2004 looking at the Rural Strategy, and in 2005 the Natural \n        Environment and Rural Communities Bill. \n\n      In particular, the inquiry will consider: \n\n      - Defra's objectives for economic development in rural areas, including \n        the relevant Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets and funding.\n\n      - Regional Development Agencies’ (RDAs) role in unlocking the economic \n        potential of rural areas, and Defra's relationship with RDAs.\n\n      - Agricultural and non-agricultural providers of rural employment and \n        possible barriers to their further development.\n\n      - Ensuring rural proofing arrangements are effective in rural aspects \n        of economic development and are properly reflected in national and regional \n        policy.\n\n      - The role of Natural England and the CRC.\n\n      See Press Release at http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environment__food_and_rural_affairs/efra_pn61_060727.cfm\n\n      \n\n       Communications Team, MRDP, Defra\n\n        4A Ergon House, Horseferry Road\n\n        London SW1P 2AL\n\n        Email:  mrd.comms@defra.gsi.gov.uk\n\n        Tel: 020 7238 4958 \n\n        Fax: 020 7238 5865 \n\n      \n\n      Archived newsletters: \n\n      Back to top \n\n      \tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - August 2006  \n          [54KB] \n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - July 2006  \n          [54KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - June 2006  \n          [85KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - May 2006  \n          [121KB] \n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - April 2006  \n          [66KB] \n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - March 2006  \n          [64KB] \n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - February 2006  \n          [65KB] \n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - January 2006  \n          [54KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - December 2005  \n          [78KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - November 2005  \n          [85KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - October 2005  \n          [37KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - September 2005  \n          [144KB]\n\t Modernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - August 2005  \n          [78KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - July 2005  \n          [139KB]\n\tModernising \n          Rural Delivery newsletter - April 2005  \n          [86KB]\n\n\n      Related Links\n\n      English \n        National Parks and Environmental Land Management Funding Protocol \n         \n        [101KB] \n\n      Minutes of the Strategic Reference Group \n\n      Back to top \n\n      The Strategic Reference Group was set up to challenge MRD to ensure it \n        will deliver benefits that matter to our customers.

February 2004) announced the award of 29 grants worth £5m as part of its initiative to strengthen UK brain sciences research and build foundations for future work to help tackle major mental health problems.\n\nThe innovative projects cover a wide variety of scientific approaches to address major disorders and diseases such as depression, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  \n\nThe awards range from basic studies of genetics, biological markers and mechanisms of disease, utilising new imaging techniques or better exploitation of existing technology to creating new or enhanced packages of care for mental health and future development of clinical trials.\n\nThe awards are made as a result of the first round of the MRC’s call for proposals for brain sciences research launched in the Summer of 2003.  The call followed two themes: ‘Trial Platforms’ to pave the way for rigorous evaluation using clinical trials and ‘Pathfinders’ designed to build knowledge and capacity for future research.  \n\nA total of £ 2.23m was awarded for 11 Trial Platforms and £2.82m for 18 Pathfinder grants.  MRC was particularly keen to attract bright scientists at early stages of their careers for the Pathfinder grants and eight of these projects will be led by such researchers.\n\nThe successful awards include*:\n \n•Testing of new imaging technology to help surgeons target more precisely the areas in the brain to treat Parkinson’s in order to improve the outcome of neurosurgery\n\n•Exploring brain inflammation as a predictor for Alzheimer’s \n\n•Study of changes in the white brain matter in sufferers of bi-polar (manic depressive) disorder in order to explore the genetic basis of  to look for genetic clues to the illness\n\n•Study of gene FOXP2 implicated in developmental learning disorders such autism, dyslexia and speech and language impairment.\n\n•Vitamin treatment to reduce the amino acid homocysteine (a newly discovered risk factor) in the blood of Alzheimer’s patients \n\n•Understanding causes of depression in pregnant women and the long-term health effects for mother and child.\n\n•Understanding how anti-depressants work in the body with the aim of improving therapies and targeted treatment \n\nProfessor Nancy Rothwell, Chair of the MRC Neurosciences and Mental Health Board who chaired the Pathfinder panel said: \n\n“We had an excellent response to this call and the standard of application was very high.  The pathfinder grants are all dynamic, internationally competitive and will advance our understanding of mental illness.  In the longer term they offer hope of new diagnosis, prevention and treatment.”\n\nDr  David Armstrong, Chair of the MRC Health Services and  Public Health Research Board  who chaired the Trial Platform panel said:”\n\n“Overall, two thirds of all the grants awarded are for clinical research.   Well-designed clinical trials are important if we are to effectively assess the healthcare being provided to the population.  Some of these platforms create potential for large-scale trials in the future, but many could have an immediate impact on care and the ways in which it is provided for patients and their families.”\n\nProfessor Colin Blakemore, Chief Executive of the MRC said: “This package of awards is a really exciting boost for brain research which will address some of the most common problems affecting people in the UK today.\n\n“We have a good mix of experienced researchers and those at the start of their careers.   Developing scientists’ careers is one of my priorities for the MRC and this should help them fulfil what the panel saw as their outstanding potential as leading researchers for the future.  \n\n“The applications we received were also so cost-effective that we’ve been able to support a third more projects than we anticipated at the outset.”\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information please call the MRC press office on 020 7 637 6011\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\n* These grants have been highlighted to show range and diversity and do not reflect any other status attached to them\n\nTo access a full list of the grants made under this call see the MRC website \nhttp://www.mrc.ac.uk/funding-bscall-successful.htm\n\nThis call has been funded out of SR2002 money for brain sciences.  The second phase of the MRC Brain Sciences Initiative will be a new call for proposals launched in Summer 2004.  Details have yet to be confirmed but will be posted on the MRC web and advertised in the academic press.  For further general information relating to this call and MRC’s work in the area of brain sciences see http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index/public-interest/public-topical_issues/public-brain_science.htm\n\n\nMRC spend on neuroscience and mental health in

Make sure you read all the information before agreeing anything.\n\nWhat protection does the site offer if a transaction goes wrong? Remember the site provider can refuse to accept responsibility if a trade goes wrong because of a trader's action.\n\nMany sites do provide users with limited compensation in some instances and also access to dispute resolution schemes but be clear what is being offered.\n\nCheck out the seller or buyer\n\nMost auction sites operate a feedback system which allows you to see comments by other users who have traded with that person. Check the person's rating and read the comments. If you see bad comments consider carefully whether or not to trade. Check out where the trader is based, how easy would it be to get your money back if things went wrong?\n\nCheck out the item you are buying:\n\n\tensure the description of the item is adequate \n\n\tdon't be afraid to ask questions before bidding if you are unsure of something, an honest seller will be happy to clarify \n\n\tdo some research and work out what would be a fair price for the item \n\n\tset yourself a maximum bid and stick to it\n\n\nMake sure you know:\n\n\thow much is the postage \n\n\twill the item be insured \n\n\tis it being sent from overseas \n\n\tare your credit card details kept secure \n\n\twhat form of payment will the seller accept.\n\n\nPayments\n\nPaying by credit card can in some circumstances offer additional protection. So does payment by escrow service, where a trusted third party holds the money until the goods are received.\n\nOther pages in this section:\n\n\tavoiding fraud \n\n\tyour legal rights\n\n\nBack to internet auctions homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\tmore consumer information\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nYour rights when shopping from home\n\n\n\n\nOnline shopping\n\n\n\n\nInternet auctions\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBefore bidding\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTop tips to avoid fraud\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\tYour legal rights\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nOnline health products\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ access keys\n| home\n| what's new\n| site map\n| advanced search\n| complaints procedure\n| skip ]\n\n\n\n\n",

The latter lays out the legal framework and procedures for most of Tanzania’s rural land to henceforth be governed through a community-based land tenure management system. This devolves authority over land administration, land management and dispute resolution to the community level. This paper aims to provide a very simple but comprehensive explanation of the Village Land Act, which came into effect in May 2001. It includes a list of questions and answers about the new law, which were originally for Tanzanian District Councils as base material upon which they developed simple material aids and guidelines for villagers.\n\tLinks:\tOrder from EarthPrint  View PDF report  (392k)\n\n\n      \n\n      Copyright © 2005 International Institute for Environment and Development.\n\n  All rights reserved. \n\n  3 Endsleigh Street, London WC1H 0DD, email: info@iied.org.\n\n  tel: +44 (0) 20 7388 2117, fax: +44 (0) 20 7388 2826.\n\n  UK Registered charity no. 800066.\n\n       Contact\n            the Web Developer | Legal\n      Notice\n\n    \t\n   \n\n      \n      New Publications Publications \n        Help \n\n      \tView some of our flagship publications: \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n      IIED's Publication Catalogue: From Words to Action:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          view PDF (1.31Mb)\n\n  To obtain a hard copy please email:\n\n  info@earthprint.com \n\n      \n\n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n\t\t\n           \n\n          \n\n           \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n",

The final official\nHarvest release (1.4pl2) forms the basis for current open source\ndevelopment.\n\n Download http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/harvest/\n\n\n Community support: harvest-develop@tardis.ed.ac.uk mailing list\nand comp.infosystems.harvest Usenet group\n\t\tLicensing requirements: Open source software\ndistributed under the terms of the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n\tPurpose\tOriginally intended to be a generalised resource\ndiscovery system built in a modularised fashion, designed as an\nopen-ended system using network protocols, programming APIs and a\nstandard metadata format (SOIF).\n\tApproach\tA Gatherer component performs indexing of\narbitrary content, using the Essence system from the University\nof Arizona (included in the package). Metadata records (in SOIF\nformat) are produced by summarisers; the metadata records are\nmade available by the Gatherer component; a Broker component\nperiodically fetches SOIF records from Gatherers and indexes\nthem. The Broker is searched either using the Harvest Broker\nprotocol, or by plugging in search engines. The package tries to\nimplement the modular design by reusing readily available\nsoftware (such as existing indexers e.g. glimpse, the Essence\nsystem, existing HTTP servers), and Harvest is essentially the\nplumbing to connect these components together over a\nnetwork.\n\tPlatform and\nrequirements\tHttp server, Perl, C compiler. Runs on any modern\nUnix-like system.\n\tComponents and their\ntechnology\t\n\tServer\tThe Harvest Broker component serves this\nrole.\n\tDatabase\t\n\tSearch\ntools/clients\tUser interacts via HTTP. Search is performed via\na web form. A Perl CGI script (nph-search) speaks the Harvest\nBroker protocol to the Broker and returns HTML to the end\nuser.\n\tAPI\t\n\tMetadata Formats\tOnly the SOIF metadata format (originally\ndeveloped for Harvest) is supported.\n\tExtras/Other\nfeatures\tVery limited web-based administration features\nare provided, e.g. one can initiate a gathering operation.\n\t\tA new version of Harvest is written entirely in\nPerl.\n\t\tSee review\nin the Renardus report for additional comments.\n\n\n\n\tASF \tHarvest\tIndex+ \tIsaac \n\tMetastar \tROADS \tSitesearch \tZope \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThese pages were maintained by Monica Duke and Richard Waller of UKOLN, University of\nBath. \n\n\n\nThis page was last updated on February 7th 2001. \n\n\nThe IMesh Toolkit project was funded under the NSF/JISC International Digital Libraries Initiative from September 1999 to July 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

the Order)\n\n\nThis Order, which applies to England only, amends the Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants) Order 1978, revokes earlier amendment Orders and comes into force on 1st December 2004. It substitutes for Schedules 1 and 2 to the 1978 Order the Schedules set out in this Order. Schedule 1 lists disinfectants approved by the Secretary of State and Schedule 2 lists disinfectants which, although no longer approved, may continue to be used as approved disinfectants until 28th February 2005.\n\n\nThis Order was notified in draft to the European Commission in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC.\n\n\nA regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1]\n1981 c. 22; see section 86(1) for definitions of \"the Minister\" and \"the Ministers\". Functions of \"the Ministers\", so far as exercisable in relation to England, were transferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by the Transfer of Functions (Agriculture and Food) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/3141) and functions of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were transferred to the Secretary of State by article 2 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794).back\n\n[2]\nS.I. 1978/32.back\n\n\n[3]\nS.I. 2003/1420.back\n\n\n[4]\nS.I. 2001/608.back\n\n\n[5]\nS.I. 2000/3195.back\n\n\n[6]\nS.I. 1999/919.back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISBN\n0 11 050123 3\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\t\n\nOther UK SIs | Home | National Assembly for Wales Statutory Instruments | Scottish Statutory Instruments | Statutory Rules of Northern Ireland | \nHer Majesty's Stationery Office\n\t\n\n\t\nWe welcome your comments on this site\n\t© Crown copyright 2004\tPrepared\n1 December 2004\n\n\n\n\n",

In contrast to most available studies, the paper assesses the longer term impact on these children, considering how early education has affected their cognitive and social skills whilst at school, and their educational attainment and labour market outcomes into adulthood. \n\t \tContact:\nAlissa Goodman or Barbara Sianesi\nRelated publication\n\n Early education and children's outcomes: low long do the impacts last?Other press releases\n All press releases for 2005\n Press releases for 2006\n Public finance bulletins\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tDisclaimer · Copyright · Accessibility · Email webmaster · \n\nLast updated 11-09-06\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n",

Following on from the recommendations of the Transforming Youth Work Warwick Conference in 2002 the Workforce Development Implementation Group worked on the next phase. Its report was welcomed by Margaret Hodge, Minister for Children and Young People.  \nYou can download a copy of the full report  and the executive summary    \nThe NYA has produced guidelines and self-assessment framework to help organisations providing youth work services to create a workforce development policy and seek NYA accreditation.  An accredited workforce development policy is now one of the recognised characteristics of a good quality youth service, in line with the Government's Resourcing Excellent Youth Services agenda.  Guidelines for Development and Accrediting a Workforce Development Policy in a Youth Work Organisation are available from the NYA Quality Standards Team priced at £30 + VAT.  For further information contact Ann Wilson or Diane Evans - NYA Quality Standards Team.  \nRefining the Youth Work Standards and Performance Indicators\nThe NYA icontinues to work with DfES in sharpening the standards and targets in REYS, making sure they match up with each other and improving their practical usage.  More information is available on:\n\tCredit Where It s Due Benchmark and FAQs\n\nYouth Services Quality Mark\nREYS stated the Government wanted to see a kitemark developed which would give the seal of approval for Youth Services.  The NYA together with its Quality Action Group is working up proposals with pilots in each of the 9 regions developing the Quality Mark.  View the list of QAG members.\nVisit the Quality Mark website.\nFAQs about Quality Mark\nWe've tried to give some answers to many of the questions people frequently ask us to do with youth work training, qualifications and professional development on the frequently asked questions part of The NYA site. \nMembers and contact details of the Quality Standards Team are set out on The NYA staff list - go to About the NYA\n\n\nGlobal Gang.

          "The Methodist Church of Great Britain\n\n\tThe Methodist Church of Great Britain\n\t \n\n\n\n\t Faith, Ministry & Church: Vice President John Bell addresses Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Vice President of Conference 2005/6, \nJohn Bell, is a retired\nbusiness executive from the Chester and Stoke \nDistrict. He was\neducated at grammar schools in Sunderland and \nNewcastle, later\nstudying Economics at Manchester University \nand Industrial Management\nat the University of Leeds. He is married to \nJoan and has two grown-up\nchildren, Alison and Martin. John has a \nspecial interest in the role\nof faith in the workplace, and in the \nselection and training of people\nfor ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis morning John addressed delegates and \nguests at the Sunday morning\nworship service, welcoming a diverse assembly \nof people and inviting\nthem to reflect on faith, ministry and church \nfrom their own\nperspectives. He spoke of those who had \nprofoundly influenced and\nchallenged him on his own faith journey, \nencouraging those present to\ndo the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the diversity that comes with \nfaith, John commented that\n\"Perhaps, the broader our base, the stronger \nwe may become. Let us\nhold this in our minds when we consider the \nConference report\nPilgrimage of Faith, reflecting our shared \njourney on human sexuality.\nNo, we haven't arrived; the journey is not \nstraightforward; maybe we\ndon't even know the destination. But let us \ncontinue to journey,\nsafely, together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our faith, with its amalgam of belief and \nunbelief, our confidence in\nGod this day, even if we would have difficulty \narticulating these\nthings, are a gathering of all that has gone \nbefore in our lives,\nperhaps shredded, honed and glued together \nagain through the years.\nLike the two on the road to Emmaus, as we \njourney and wrestle, we will\nglimpse Jesus, the risen Lord.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis diversity of faith is carried into the \nministry of the church in\nall its variety. John challenged ordained \nministers to have the\ncourage to follow their hopes for the \nMethodist Church in the 21st\nCentury, and spoke of the need to recognise \nthe value of lay ministry;\n\"Yes, we may engage in the work of the \ngathered church, but we have\nenormous opportunity to exercise our Christian \nministry where we work\nor otherwise commit and spend our time \n(whether in parenting, in\nretirement, in community service, in many \nother situations). What a\nwonderful opportunity we have! And yet, so \nneglected in the\necclesiastical pecking order. In my time with \nthe Connexional\nCandidates Committee, I often asked candidates \nabout their call to\nordained ministry – it seemed a fair question –\n and was most dismayed\nby the sincerely offered answers that amounted \nto 'I want to give\nmyself full-time to serving God. I can't do \nthat in a secular job:'\noh, no? Where did you develop this taste for \nluxury? Of course I knew\nwhat they meant, but it seemed to betray a \nnarrow view of mission\npossibilities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving to the final of the service's themes, \nhe said, \"What is surely\nbeyond doubt is that 'the church' is the \nhardest bit. People say 'it's\nnot just about numbers:' no, it isn't. If we \nreflect on the Old\nTestament idea of the remnant of Israel, maybe \nwe are the Christian\nremnant today in whom God has put his trust. \nBut we cannot be content\nthat God expects nothing of us: Jesus' great \ncommission in Matthew 28\nto make disciples of all nations is direct \nenough. It's neither\ncomplacency nor panic, but faith and vision \nwith a strong dose of\nhonesty and realism that are needed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn believes that being part of the Church \ninvolves four key\nchallenges for each and every member; \nupholding the faithful through\npastoral support, finding fresh ways or being \nand doing church,\nworking in partnership with those of other \ndenominations and learning\nfrom the confidence and success of our partner \nchurches in other\ncontinents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally John called for the Church to be open \nto new insights in the\nsearch for and pilgrimage with God, for which \nbeing open to the person\nand work of Jesus and the inspirational \nchallenge of discipleship is\nessential.\n\n \n\n\n \nNews index \n\n \nMedia contacts \n\n \n\n\t\n\t \n\tCopyright ©2006 Trustees for Methodist Church Purposes. \t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n",

Concern has grown over the way that faith is represented. In such a context, can the artist still claim total freedom of expression? Artists of all backgrounds and descriptions have recently found themselves colliding with religious and racial sensitivities. A Sikh playwright was attacked for her work by other Sikhs. A satirical opera featuring Christ was barracked by Christians. Internationally, the pattern repeats itself as nations increasingly lose homogeneity.  \n\n \n\nThe panel explores whether it is enough to cite artistic freedom as the over-riding good. Surely rights must be balanced with responsibilities?  Does the right to give offence outweigh the right not to be offended? And in the final alliance, might we need to find a new process and dialogue so that sections that currently and dangerously feel excluded can be part of a public debate?  \n\n \n\nThis timely art06 debate is in association with Night Waves, BBC Radio 3's daily arts and ideas programme.  The discussion will be broadcast on Radio 3 on Monday 12 June at 9.30pm.\n\n \n\nThe panel is chaired by Paul Allen and includes the prominent playwright, David Edgar.   \n\n \n\nThere is no charge for the agenda but as there is limited capacity in the venue pre-booking is essential so please click on online booking now to reserve your seat. online booking\n\n\n\nPanel members biographies are now available here.\n\n\nThe Harris Museum, Preston Photo: Norwyn Creative Imaging\nDavid Edgar.

If I send in a blood sample and a hundred bucks, they can tell me if my family came to the US from Scotland via the group that migrated to Ireland in the 1700's; or if I came from Scotland via the group that stayed and fought for the English king.

If the American Indians are descended from the Lamanites who originated in Jerusalem, is there any DNA evidence at all to support this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the relevant portion of the intro to the BoM:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. ... After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is twofold:\n\n\n1) We don't know much of anything about the genetics of the original people who came from Jerusalem.  Although some genetic lines can be traced (like the Cohen line), there isn't any such thing as \"Hebrew DNA\".\n\n\n\n\n\n2) The definition of what it means to be a Lamanite changes over the hundreds of years from 600 BC to the end of the BoM.  It doesn't just mean genetics and parentage.  It's became a political affiliation, religious affiliation, and a choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Cue David Letterman \"top 10\" music)\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 7 Ways You know you're a Lamanite.

A group of people migrated from the Middle East. It seperated into two nations, the Nephites and the Lamanites. Eventually only the latter survived and they are the anscestors of the American Indians. It doesn't say that the Lamanites weren't really Lamanites, only half, or partial or sort of Lamanites, somehow different from the group which came from Jerusalem.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, even if a Lamanite was a Nephite who became or deserted to the Lamanites, or a descendant of Zoram, he would still be able to trace his anscestry back to the people who came from Jerusalem and his DNA would indicate an origin in the Middle East or at least have charecteristics in common with other ME inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, again, has anything been found in the DNA of the American Indian which might suggest a link with the Middle East? And if not, where do the studies which have been done suggest they may have come from?\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaret\n_________________\n\"On Christ the Solid Rock I stand,\n\n\n All other ground is sinking sand.\"\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tHomestar Runner\n\n\n\nJoined: 26 Jul 2005\nPosts: 335\nLocation: Colorado\n\t\tPosted: Mon Dec 12, 2005 8:53 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tHi Margaret,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big glaring assumption you are making is that the Americas were empty of all people except for Lehi and gang.

This does not suggest much in the way of inter-marriage with other races which may have been there at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou say that the Book of Mormon is silent on the subject of other groups of people that Lehi and his descendants may have come across. Yet it goes into detail about the animals, the types of plants and the metals they found there. It seems odd then that nothing is said about any other inhabitants that may have been there also, particularly if inter-marriage was involved. The Bible records vividly the many stresses and tensions which resulted when God's people formed marriage relationships with the heathen tribes that shared their land. Would the people of the Book of Mormon not have had similar problems? The B of M claims to be a history of the former inhabitants of the continent. For inter-marriage to have taken place on a scale sufficient for the Jewish migrants to have lost their genetic markers by 300AD (a mere 900 years since their arrival in 600BC) there must have been a serious breakdown in the structure of their society and for this to have happened without it being considered significant enough to warrant any mention in the Book of Mormon seems incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid the early leaders believe that the American Indians were mainly of Lamanite descent? It would appear so from their statements. Joseph Smith sent delegations to preach to \"the Lamanites\", he spoke of \"the borders of the Lamanites\" and while he did not say that all the American Indians of his day were Lamanites, the impression he gave was that they were principally of Lamanite descent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrigham Young also considered the American Indians to be Lamanites and of Jewish descent.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Discourses of Brigham Young\", compiled be John Widtsoe, pages 122 and 123, he is quoted as saying,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a curse on these aborigines of our country who roam the plains, and are so wild that you cannot tame them. They are of the House of Israel: they once had the Gospel delivered to them, they had the oracles of truth: Jesus came and administered to them after his resurrection, and they received and delighted in the Gospel until the fourth generation when they turned away and became so wicked that God cursed them with this dark and benighted and loathsome condition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe did not say \"they used to be\", nor did he suggest that their genetic inheritance had become so watered down that no-one could say any longer where in fact they came from, he said \"they ARE of the House of Israel.\" So where is the DNA evidence to support this?\n\n\n\n\n\nSpencer Kimball took a gentler view of the Lamanites. From \"The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball\", p596 I quote,  --\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You Polynesians of the Pacific are called Samoan or Maori, Tahitian or Hawaiian, according to your islands. There are probably 60 million of you on the two continents and on the Pacific Islands, all related by blood ties. The Lord calls you Lamanites, a name which has a pleasant ring, for many of the grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah. The name Lamanite distinguishes you from other peoples. It is not a name of derision or embarrassment, but one of which to be proud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI assume therefore, that there is DNA evidence to support this teaching that the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands are of Semitic origin. \n\n\n\n\n\nMargaret\n_________________\n\"On Christ the Solid Rock I stand,\n\n\n All other ground is sinking sand.\"\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tHomestar Runner\n\n\n\nJoined: 26 Jul 2005\nPosts: 335\nLocation: Colorado\n\t\tPosted: Tue Dec 13, 2005 10:27 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tHi Margaret,\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems from your post that you continue to not avail yourself of the links I posted.

They really, really do explore this fascinating issue more broadly and more deeply than I'm able to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMargaret wrote:\n\tThe introduction states that the Lamanites were the PRINCIPAL ancestors of the American Indians. This does not suggest much in the way of inter-marriage with other races which may have been there at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect.

The Bible's scope is also a lot more comprehensive across both centuries and peoples.  To draw a rough analogy, the Bible is like the complete history of Europe for 15 centuries, the BoM is like the history of the Welsh people from 1300-1400.   Much different scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\t For inter-marriage to have taken place on a scale sufficient for the Jewish migrants to have lost their genetic markers by 300AD (a mere 900 years since their arrival in 600BC) there must have been a serious breakdown in the structure of their society and for this to have happened without it being considered significant enough to warrant any mention in the Book of Mormon seems incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, it's not.  Archaology paints a fairly believable picture of possibly several million inhabitants living in the Americas when Lehi arrived in 600 BC.  Compare several million against Lehi's small group (we're not really told how many, but maybe 30 or 40 people total?).  It's really not that hard to believe that the genetics got lost in the soup.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the link above contains an essay giving people a quick \"genetics 101\" lesson that helps you understand this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\tDid the early leaders believe that the American Indians were mainly of Lamanite descent? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort answer - yes.  And we still do.  The word \"principal ancestor\" still applies.  Again, \"Lamanite descent\" can mean many different things.  It's possible that every person alive when Columbus arrived was related in some way to Lehi, and it's quite probable that any or all genetic markers have been lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\tI assume therefore, that there is DNA evidence to support this teaching that the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands are of Semitic origin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou seem quite hesitant to abandon this question, even though I keep pointing out to you that it's moot.

I would suggest at this stage that even several millions, from the tip of Alaska to the bottom end of South America would have been spread rather thinly and it would have been quite possible for this band of people to have continued for quite a long time without being assimilated into a larger group. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat's just a thought, but when I also consider that migrant people tend to stick together, especially when they find themselves in an alien land and that God's  people in the Old World were not supposed to inter-marry anyway, I am skeptical. If they had been assimilated to the degree you suggest - that they \"lost\" their DNA, they would also have lost their cultural and ultimately spiritual identity. Yet the Book of Mormon records these people as creating great civilizations and being unique enough to be considered the \"Other Sheep\" when it recounts Jesus appearing to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have had a look round various sites, admittedly only a small portion of the many available,  and I only found one scientist who mentioned the \"genetic soup\" theory and that was only a passing references. None of \n\n\nthe others did. These are scientists who are working in the field of genetic research, and they include Mormons, and their conclusions seem to be that there is no link between the American Indians and the Jewish Peoples. If there was a plausable explanation (ie genetic soup\") for the absence of DNA they would have referred to it and not considered this absence such a serious problem for the credibility of the Book of Mormon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem I find with the FARMS link you gave is that, as far as I understand, this research foundation was set up and funded  by the Mormon Church in order to provide evidence for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. This in itself does not invalidate its research but as it is not independant, its findings must be viewed with a degree of caution. Rather than honestly looking at the evidence and seeing where it leads, however uncomfortable that might be , there is the danger of shaping the evidence to fit a predetermined conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, for example, schools were provided with educational materials fronted by a dentist, who claimed that sugar was not so damaging to children's teeth and health as previously thought, you might, and I hope you would, wonder who was paying for it. You would not be surprised then to find out the money was coming from a sugar company. \n\n\n\n\n\nNeither of us knows enough about this subject to be able to properly evaluate all the research findings. All we can do is read widely and come to as honest a conclusion as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where are we? The Lamanites, from the far north of Canada, down through South America and across the Pacific, have no identifiable Jewish blood in them. This is in spite of many, many assurances by Mormon prophets and apostles, that they were, and are, \"of royal blood,\" \"the children of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Lehi.\" Now it seems they could have come from anywhere - except we now know for sure, as was always suspected, that they came from Asia and there is no evidence at all to suggest a Middle East input.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the writers I've come across have stated that the amount of research which has been done, in this area as well as others, ie geography, linguistics etc, has undermined the authority of the Book of Mormon as a historical document and thus of Joseph Smith as a prophet. It has been suggested that one way forward for the Mormon Church would be to gradually phase out its teaching that the Book of Mormon is a factual history, and replace it, again gradually, with the idea that it is only an expression of a spiritual experience and not to be taken literally. \n\n\n\n\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaret\n_________________\n\"On Christ the Solid Rock I stand,\n\n\n All other ground is sinking sand.\"\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tHomestar Runner\n\n\n\nJoined: 26 Jul 2005\nPosts: 335\nLocation: Colorado\n\t\tPosted: Fri Dec 16, 2005 10:26 pm    Post subject: Re: Bible v Book of Mormon Video\t   \n\t\n\n\tHi Margaret,\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMargaret wrote:\n\tI would suggest at this stage that even several millions, from the tip of Alaska to the bottom end of South America would have been spread rather thinly and it would have been quite possible for this band of people to have continued for quite a long time without being assimilated into a larger group. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would agree.

A brief cursory reading of the BoM shows that both Nephite and Lamanite culture changed dramatically at numerous points throughout the book.  Lamanite abandoning of the traditions of their fathers occurred within a generation or less.  There were long periods of seperation between BoM authors and the other groups they encountered.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's see - my family migrated to the US in the early 1800's.  It's only been 200 years, but my dad certainly didn't consider himself a migrant, nor did his father, nor his, nor his.  I doubt that my original immigrant ancestors thought of the US as \"an alien land\" within 5 or 10 years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\t If they had been assimilated to the degree you suggest - that they \"lost\" their DNA, they would also have lost their cultural and ultimately spiritual identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, not necessarily.  I'll get to your criticism of FARMS below, but if you refuse to look at the links I provided, any kind of \"genetic population study 101\" material will do.

Nobody seems interested in funding a study.  All mormon-related stuff you hear in the field is without exception, taking results from someone else's study and noting that there is no link.  That's kind of like watching the evening news, and hearing the news anchor say \"No cats were involved in a bus/train collision.\"  In reality, nobody was looking for cats.  The police didn't say anything about cats - the hospitals have no records of injured cats, the reporters didn't talk about cats.

Does it come from the Ashkenazim, the largest proportion of the identifiable Jewish people existing today?  They descended from a group of only a few thousand ancestors who lived in and around the territory of Poland about five centuries ago.  Is it the Lembas of southern Africa, who show thoroughly Negroid blood groups?  Is it the Falasha Jews from Ethiopia?  The Bene-Israel group that developed in India, descended from 7 founding families a few hundred years ago?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\t This is in spite of many, many assurances by Mormon prophets and apostles, that they were, and are, \"of royal blood,\" \"the children of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Lehi.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, how do you know they didn't?  \n\n\n\n\n\nI'll quote a bit from one of my FARMS articles:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand what Israel meant anciently in terms of kinship relations, it is necessary to review the history and development of that people as described in the biblical account. Abraham is the first person to be called a \"Hebrew\" in the Bible (Genesis 14:13), though his grandson Jacob, who lived in Syria for a time, is termed a \"Syrian\" (Deuteronomy 26:5). The Bible gives us the names of Abraham's patrilineal male ancestors, but we know nothing about the origin of his mother or his wife Sarah. This poses a problem for a researcher hoping to trace the Abrahamic genetic heritage using mtDNA.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Sarah's son, Isaac, Abraham had sons by two other wives: an Egyptian named Hagar, who bore Ishmael (Genesis 16:1, 3; 21:9; 25:12); and a woman of unknown origin named Keturah, who bore six sons (Genesis 25:1–4). Besides his own children and immediate family, Abraham's house included men and women servants and people he had converted to his faith (Genesis 12:5; Abraham 2:15). Among these were his chief steward, Eliezer (Genesis 15:2), and 318 \"trained servants, born in his own house,\" who could be mustered for battle (Genesis 14:14). All of these, according to the custom of the time, would have been considered \"Hebrews,\" though they may have had no biological relationship to Abraham. This presents a second problem for those who hope to use the Bible as documentation of genetic connections.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham's son Ishmael married an Egyptian woman (Genesis 21:21), while Isaac married his cousin Rebekah. Isaac's son Esau had two Hittite wives (Genesis 26:34) and another who was a daughter of Ishmael (Genesis 28:8-9). Esau's brother, Jacob, who came to be known as Israel, fathered twelve sons and one daughter by four wives (Genesis 29:28–35; 30:1–24; 35:15–19). Each of Jacob's children would have carried the mtDNA of his or her mother. While two of these wives, Leah and Rachel, were Jacob's cousins, the Bible tells us nothing of the origins and background of the other two, Zilpah and Bilhah.\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, little is known of the women who married the sons of Jacob, though we know that Joseph married an Egyptian, Asenath, who bore him Manasseh and Ephraim (Genesis 41:45, 50–52).8 Joseph's half-brother Judah had three sons by a Canaanite wife named Shuah and twin sons by Tamar, whose ancestry is unknown (Genesis 38:2–30). Of the half-Canaanite sons, only one (Shelah) lived long enough to have posterity, but his mtDNA would be unlike that of his half-brothers, Pharez and Zarah, unless their mothers were sisters (Genesis 46:12; Numbers 26:19–21). From Pharez descended Salmon, who married the Canaanite woman Rahab, who had been spared with her father's household during the Israelite destruction of the city of Jericho in Joshua's day. Their son was Boaz, who married the Moabitess Ruth, who became the great-grandmother of King David and, consequently, of all the kings of Judah and of Jesus Christ himself (Ruth 4:18–22; Matthew 1:2–16). While most of the kings of Judah from whom Christ is descended married women of the same tribe or of other Israelite tribes, this is not true of all of them. For example, Rehoboam, son of Solomon, was born of a woman named Naamah, who was an Ammonitess (1�Kings 14:21, 31; 2 �Chronicles 12:13). Genesis 40:10 informs us that Simeon had a Canaanite wife, but nothing is said of the other wives of Jacob's sons or their origins, although it seems likely that they also married outside Abraham's kin group. The children and grandchildren of Jacob who are mentioned in the biblical account number seventy, but this does not include daughters and granddaughters. Although nothing is specifically said on the matter, it is not unreasonable to assume that Jacob's people included servants and their families as well.9 One thing, however, seems certain: all of Jacob's grandchildren inherited their mtDNA from their mothers, who were likely non-Israelite.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know very little about Israelite marriage practices in Egypt during the four-hundred-year sojourn there; however, there is some indication that intermarriage with non-Israelite peoples was not uncommon (see, for example, Leviticus 24:10). Moses married a Midianitess (Exodus 2:21). When the Israelites left Egypt, it is said that a \"mixed multitude\" went with them (Exodus 12:38; Numbers 11:4).10 Whatever its size, the exodus group included many who were not descended from Jacob's original family.11 We have no details about the ancestry of these other people, but we know from Leviticus 24:10 that at least one of the men who fled into the wilderness with Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\tSome of the writers I've come across have stated that the amount of research which has been done, in this area as well as others, ie geography, linguistics etc, has undermined the authority of the Book of Mormon as a historical document and thus of Joseph Smith as a prophet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote them.

(I'm not going to shell out much money, though.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\tQuote:\n\t It has been suggested that one way forward for the Mormon Church would be to gradually phase out its teaching that the Book of Mormon is a factual history, and replace it, again gradually, with the idea that it is only an expression of a spiritual experience and not to be taken literally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard that notion.  I've never heard it entertained by anyone with a rudimentary grasp of this issue, though.  I've only heard it from mormons desperate to hold onto their beliefs by refusing to look through the telescope.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nHSR\n_________________\n1 Don't seek info from his enemies.

Sorry for not getting back sooner - visitors!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll reply in no particular order.\n\n\n\n\n\nFARMS\n\n\n\n\n\nFarms receives a great deal of support from affluent church members. Its funds come from private donations. It has the use of premises provided by BYU which functions under the direction of the church. FARMS works closely with the church's Deseret Book Company and is co-publisher with the company on works on the Book of Mormon. FARMS scholars approach their research fully convinced of the truthfulness of the book of Mormon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would think it is about as independent and objective, let's say, as a group of Jehovah's Witness scholars who work from premises provided by a Watchtower owned educational establishment; who receive the bulk of their funding from dedicated Jwhovah's Witnesses; who start and end their researches with the conviction that the Watchtower Society is \"God's Organisation\" and whose publications promote that organisation as \"the truth\".\n\n\n\n\n\nYou ask what Jewish Blood would look like. Perhaps you should ask President Hinckley. In a prayer at the dedication of the Mexico City temple in December 1983 he stated,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bless Thy Saints in this great land and those from other lands who will use this temple. Most have in their veins the blood of our father Lehi.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe made a similar reference to \"the blood of Lehi\" when he was in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1999 to dedicate another temple.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you mean \"what would Jewish DNA look like? Your position is that it was there but has been lost. You also suggest that as we do not know the genetic composition of many of the Old Testament characters we are unable to point to a specific Jewish DNA marker. However the people you mentioned, whether Israelite, Hittite Caananite, Egyptian etc would have shared common identifiable Middle Eastern DNA markers. No evidence of any link with ME DNA has been found in the American Indians.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou mentioned the Lamba People. I'll quote here from an article I found,\n\n\n\"Lamanites no More: DNA and Lost Ties to Father Lehi\"; http://www.irr.org/mit/Lamanites-DNA-Book-of-Mormon.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While not accepting it as conclusive, Mormon scholars acknowledge the legitimacy and efficacy of DNA studies for determining a person or group's ethnic history. Sorenson gives the example of how DNA testing was used to confirm that a group of black South Africans known as the Lemba People were of Jewish origin. The group, which included Jewish Priests, migrated first to Yemen and then to Southern Africa over 2000 years ago (Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, 9:2 p70). Southerton found it notable that Sorenson acknowledges the persistence of these DNA markers in a group of people nearly 3000 years removed from their ethnic Semitic origin, yet is skeptical of its ability to do the same for a more recent Jewish ancestry in the Americas (Southerton, 2004, p.190)\n\n\n\n\n\nSorenson is, if I remember, the author of a book you mentioned. Southerton is/ was a Mormon, (don't know if he still is) and a scientist working in the field of Genetics. I know he is not flavour of the month right now, as is Thomas Murphy who is also quoted in this article and the one listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo quotes from Spencer W Kimball which I found in \"DNA and the Book of Mormon Record.\" http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/dna-bom.html\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom page 601 of \"The Teachings of Spencer W Kimball\", the twelfth Mormon Prophet stated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were two large families, those of Lehi and Ishmael, who in not many centuries numbered hundreds of millions of people on these two American continents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd from page 596 of the same book, he wrote,\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lamanites share a royal heritage. I should like to address my remarks to you, our kinsmen of the isles of the sea and the Americas. Millions of you have blood relatively unmixed with gentile nations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if their blood was \"relatively unmixed with gentile nations,\" how did it get lost in some sort of a \"genetic soup?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are any number of internet links as you'll already know. Any typed permutation  of DNA, Mormon and American will provide enough to keep you out of mischief till you draw your pension. Some have no religious agenda though they provide interesting info none the less, others are the Mormon/non Mormon where one is challenging the claims of the others. I also looked at the official Mormon one. I don't know enough to follow the scientific material, might as well have been marking an essay in Chinese, but the overall arguement had a few too many \"ifs\", \"maybes\" and \"possiblys\", to be convincing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're coming from opposing points of view. You believe the Book of Mormon to be factually true and are happy with research which provides evidence which validates the lack of evidence. I don't believe the Book of Mormon to be factually true and the lack of DNA evidence is another proof of this.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for acknowledging I have a brain. My nearest and dearest might dispute this. But what if my God given brain and my ability to detect falsehood has led me to believe the Book of Mormon is fiction......??\n\n\n\n\n\nMargaret\n_________________\n\"On Christ the Solid Rock I stand,\n\n\n All other ground is sinking sand.\"\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tGordon\n\n\n\nJoined: 31 Dec 2004\nPosts: 220\nLocation: Merseyside, England\n\t\tPosted: Sun Jan 01, 2006 5:51 am    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tJust been sitting here checking the forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nListening to Radio 5 live,  in background, they have a lot of reports from around the world. \n\n\n\n\n\nJust heard on it, report from USA, that Dan Brown author of \"The Da Vinci Code\"  his next book will be about the Mormons.  \n\n\nSeems he has been doing a lot of research into them in Salt Lake City and elsewhere. \n\n\nSpeaking to various members of the Mormon church and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wonder what the plotline will be?\n_________________\n\"People say they love Truth, but in reality they want to believe that which they love, is Truth.\"  R.J.Ringer\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\trick b\n\n\n\nJoined: 10 Apr 2005\nPosts: 475\n\n\t\tPosted: Sun Jan 01, 2006 8:53 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\thello Margaret,\n\n\ncan I ask you a question off topic? have you ever eaten hagas? if so what do you think of it? just curious, thanks, rick b\n_________________\n2 Thessalonians 1:8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalatians 4:16 Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth.\n\n\n\tBack to top\t\t      \n\n\n\n\t\n\tLaurie\n\n\n\nJoined: 14 Mar 2005\nPosts: 2573\nLocation: My real name is Lara-belle--->CANADA\n\t\tPosted: Sun Jan 01, 2006 9:37 pm    Post subject: \t   \n\t\n\n\tLet me guess...Rick B loves his hagus   \n_________________\nAnd the LORD God said, it is not good that man should be alone, I will make a help meet for him.

New agri-environment schemes, backed by £150 million a year, include a range of measures that will have widespread benefits for farmland birds. \n\n      The overall farmland birds index has been stable since 1994 although it shows a small decline between 2003 and 2004 . As well as whitethroat and greenfinch, there are encouraging signs of recovery for tree sparrow. \n\n      Minister for climate change and environment, Elliot Morley said: \n\n      “Bird populations are a good gauge of the general state of our wildlife and countryside. This government is committed to supporting and working with farmers and others to restore and enhance the habitats and conditions necessary for our precious birds to survive and thrive. \n\n      \"The exact reasons for changes in various populations are largely unknown and often very complex. We have several research projects on the go, but they may not provide easy or short-term answers. \n\n      “However, more and more farmers are joining new agri-environment schemes - now covering more than one million hectares in England alone - which can secure many more safe breeding and feeding grounds for farmland birds and other wildlife. “ \n\n      The wild bird population indicator is one of 20 UK framework indicators under the government's Sustainable Development Strategy. The indicator covers 111 species of breeding birds native to the UK, but excludes introduced and rare species. \n\n      Further information \n\n      See: \n\n      \tNews release 459/05\n\tThe Government's Sustainable Development Strategy \n\n\n       \n\n    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \tPage published: 20 October \n      2005\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t Top \n       |  Help \n       |  Feedback \n      |  Access \n      Keys  |  Copyright/Terms \n       |  Privacy\t  Department \n      for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\n\n",

          "Anaerobic Digestion \nNovember 2004 \nBriefing \nAnaerobic digestion \n \nIntroduction \nFollowing the implementation in the UK of the EU Landfill Directive, much of the \nbiodegradable waste stream which would previously have been sent to landfill has to be \ndealt with by other means. With strong public opposition from local communities to \nincineration, local authorities are increasingly looking for other means to tackle the UK’s \ngrowing waste problem. One such technique, explained in this briefing, is the process of \nanaerobic digestion (AD). \n Anaerobic digestion \nAD is a biological process naturally occurring in environments with little or no oxygen. For a \nlong time AD has been used by the farming community to process cattle slurry into a soil \nenhancer. However, with better capturing of by-products, the process is now being promoted \nby some sections of the waste industry as a technology suitable for treating biodegradable \nmunicipal waste (BMW). \nAD can be used to treat all types of biodegradable waste, including food waste. It is also \nused to stabilise mixed waste after the removal of recyclable materials, but the resulting solid \nand liquid digestates will be of lower quality and may not be suitable for use as soil \nenhancers. \nAnaerobic Digestion– how it works \nAD breaks down organic materials within an in-vessel or controlled environment. This is \nusually an airtight container, known as a digester. The AD process releases by-products, \nthese are: \n• Biogas, which is made up of around 60% methane (CH4) and 40% carbon dioxide \n(CO2). This can be burnt to generate heat and/or electricity. \n• Bio liquid or liquor digestate, which can be used, if of suitable quality, to improve soils \nas a conditioner or fertiliser.  \n• Fibre digestate, which can also be used, if of suitable quality, as a compost to apply to \nsoil. \nCharacteristically you can divide the AD process into two stages.  \nStage one – Inside the digester \nThis stage is in two phases. The first, the acidification phase (acetogenesis) is when micro-\norganisms release enzymes that convert organic compounds into fatty acids, hydrogen and \nacetic acid.  \nThe second phase known as methanogenesis is when methane and carbon dioxide are \nproduced from the organic acids.  \nDuring both phases there should be tight controls on the pH level to keep it between 5.5-8.5 \n1\nand the temperature to stay within 30-60°C, these conditions maximise the digestion rates. \nStage two– Treating the by-products. \nIn the second stage, the biogas is scrubbed so it is fit to be used in the generation of \nelectricity, while the liquid and solid digestates are used as soil enhancers or disposed of \naccording to their quality. The suitability of the digestates depends on a number of factors \nsuch as its level of contamination and how biodegradable the incoming waste stream or \nfeedstock is. Garden and kitchen waste separated at the first point of disposal, i.e. at the \nhome or kerbside (source separated) provides the best feedstock.   \n \n \n 2Anaerobic digestion \n \nPotential advantages of AD \n1. AD can process a range of different types of BMW.  \n• It can complement composting systems, catching biodegradable waste that can’t \nbe processed through windrow composting - such as cooked kitchen waste and \nanimal by-products.  \n• It can be used to stabilise waste, after mechanical separation as part of an MBT-\ntype plant (see box 1), before it goes to landfill. \n2. AD produces useful by-products, which can be easily captured. \n• The  biogas produced can be combusted when the AD plant is used with a \ncombined heat and power plant (CHP), providing electricity (which can power the AD \nprocess or be added to the national grid) and heat for homes.  \n• Methane can be further refined to produce fuel related products such as \n2\nmethanol, but AD’s role in producing biofuels needs further researching.   \n  \n• Fibre and liquid digestates can provide soil improvers and fertilisers. This may \nbecome increasingly important as the UK Government looks to improve soil \n3\nconditions and the EU Soils Directive develops. There is also some evidence that \n4\nthe digestates may suppress normal soil pathogen and parasite levels.  \n• The digestates from AD which go to landfill are stabilised and compacted, \n5\nreducing the amount of methane and leachate produced as well as odour and dust. \nAD takes under 35 days to stabilise waste, where as in landfill, biological waste may \n6\nemit methane and leachate for over 35 years.  \n3. Where data exists, compared to incineration, landfill and pyrolysis and gasification, AD \n7\nproduces the least net air and solid emissions .  \n4. Plants can be small and low rise so may be situated in towns, reducing haulage \ndistances and associated traffic pollutants. \nPotential disadvantages of AD \n1. Local authorities may see AD as a substitute for source separating materials for \nrecycling and composting. Source separation is preferable to mechanical separation \n8\nas it produces a better sorted waste fraction and encourages people to overcome \n9\nthe “throw away culture.”  \n2. If the feedstock is poor and AD cannot process the waste into soil enhancers, further \ntechniques such as composting may be needed, resulting in increased expenditure. \n3. If AD does not completely biodegrade the waste, the digestate may not meet with \nGovernment standards, so will not help local authorities to meet their Landfill \n10\nAllowance Trading Scheme targets.  \n4. AD plants create a lot of waste water. This will contain a high nitrite load and will \n 3Anaerobic digestion \nneed further processing before it can be disposed into sewage systems - although \n11\nsome water may be re-circulated during AD, particularly when the feedstock is dry. \n5. AD plants may have negative local impacts on the environment such as odour, dust \nand pollutants associated with burning methane. There are few examples of sizable \nplants in the UK, so environmental and health impacts have not been widely \nobserved.  \n \nBOX 1. Mechanical and Biological Treatment (MBT)  \nMBT is a technology that treats mixed residual waste. It mechanically extracts metals, glass, \nplastics and contaminants such as batteries still left in the waste stream. This maximises the \ndiversion of recyclables after source separation. The other part of MBT, the biological stage, \nis the point at which biodegradables are decomposed to reduce and stabilise the biologically \nactive materials. Some MBT systems may propose AD for this biological stage, capturing the \nmethane to provide energy for the plant. The residue can then be landfilled. \nFor more information read Friends of the Earth’s briefing at  \nhttp://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf \n \nThe impact on climate change and human health \nClimate Change  \nWaste disposal contributes to climate change, for example through the release of methane \nfrom landfill or the burning of fossil fuel derived plastics. Sending untreated waste to landfill \nand incineration are the worst options for climate change – according to research by the \n 12\nCommunity Recycling Network. \nBiogas composing of methane and carbon dioxide is the main climate change concern from \nthe AD process. Studies show that the CO2 produced from AD has a shorter life span and \n13\nhence a lesser impact on climate change than the methane emissions - which if not \n14\neffectively combusted has similar climate impacts as landfill emissions.  \nHowever if AD captures the biogas and is used with CHP it is an example of a low carbon \n15\ntechnology, which reduces greenhouse gases by offsetting emissions from other fossil \n16\nfuelled power stations . Furthermore, AD as a waste disposal technique powers itself, for \nexample studies on the treatment of sewage waste have suggested a 16% reduction in CO2 \n17\nemissions from using AD, in comparison to conventional sewage treatment techniques.   \nHuman Toxicity \nHuman toxicity is a measure of the potential risk to health. Currently there is little data on \nhealth impacts from AD plants. Moreover these will differ (as with the impacts to climate) if \nthe plant also provides CHP. The main emissions impacting humans are as follows: \n• Air emissions are low due to the enclosed nature of the process but if the biogas is \ncombusted will include nitrogen oxides, which have been linked to lung problems and \n 4Anaerobic digestion \n18\nallergies. However the emission rates using AD with CHP when compared to other \n19\nforms of waste disposal are generally favourable.  \n• Solid residue impacts from the digestate are more closely linked to the quality of \nfeedstock. Metals such as mercury or lead will be higher in the digestates if the AD \n20\nprocesses mixed residual waste rather than separated green and kitchen waste. \nGovernment control standards such as the Animal By-Products Regulation, will \n21\ndetermine if it can be spread on the land and come into contact with humans. \n• Liquid emissions, similarly to solid emissions, depend on the feedstock. They are also \nsubject to controls, determining whether they can be placed on the land and come into \nhuman contact.  \nThere are clear differences in health impacts depending on the type of input going into the \nAD plants, with properly separated biodegradable waste having lower health impacts than \nmixed waste. Generally AD, like composting, performs well compared with other types of \nwaste disposal techniques. However, there are two important warnings attached to these \nconclusions. \nFirstly, types and levels of emissions will change according to the activities attached to AD. \nAD with CHP will emit sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and particulates; however these \nactivities will produce net reductions in pollutant emissions compared to other energy \nsources such as coal fired power stations. \nSecondly, firm conclusions about human toxicity are difficult to draw due to the lack of \noperational AD plants and the true impacts of most emissions and the chemical interactions \nbetween them in the atmosphere are poorly understood. \nBOX 2 Case Study \nThere is one example of a full scale anaerobic digestion plant in the UK but it is Europe \nthat leads the way, with many more examples of AD as part of integrated waste \nmanagement schemes found in Denmark and Germany.  \nIn the UK there is an integrated anaerobic digester within an MBT plant in Leicester, \nWanlip, operated by Biffa. After a kerbside collection of recyclables, the remaining \nhousehold waste is front-end sorted by a ball mill, at the main MBT plant. The resulting \norganic waste is hydrated and then processed in the AD plant. The whole process digests \nabout 40,000 tonnes pa of organic waste which remains in the digester for around 18 \ndays. The biogas produced is converted by two turbines into electricity, which is then \nplaced onto the national grid, with the waste water being re-circulated back into the \ndigester and the remaining digestate then going to a windrow composting site before \nbeing applied to the land. Biffa have been unable to confirm whether the solid digestate \nwill be used as a soil conditioner or go to landfill. \nA solution to the waste crisis? \nAnaerobic digestion is an important waste disposal option to consider, due to the speed and \ndifferent types of green waste it processes and the by-products produced. Moreover it has \n 5Anaerobic digestion \npotential benefits as an energy source. Friends of the Earth would encourage local \nauthorities to consider both AD and composting as part of a sustainable waste management \nsystem. Local conditions such as whether the area is urban or rural is likely to influence the \nprocess choice.  \nFriends of the Earth also believes that AD should only be applied to the biological part of the \nwaste stream and not unsorted residual waste, as the resulting digestate is unlikely to be \nsuitable as a soil enhancer without further treatment. For this reason it is important for the \nsegregation of the waste to take place at source, as this is a much more efficient way to \n22\nseparate biological waste than mechanical sorting systems. Not only will source separated \nwaste collection systems increase the amount of waste recycled but it will also encourage \npeople to take a greater responsibility for the waste they produce.  \nReferences \n \n1\n Themelis.N.J &.Verma.S, (2004) The Better Option, anaerobic digestion of organic \nwastes in MSW.

The immediate plan is a start toward building a stockpile that eventually could reach tens of millions of doses, assuming that Congress appropriates enough money.In the worst case, scientists said, the vaccine being manufactured now would immunize only 4 million people, each of whom would need two shots a month apart. That means the vaccine would probably be restricted to critically needed personnel who would keep the government and public-safety services running during a pandemic. About a quarter of the vaccine is destined for a stockpile controlled by the Pentagon.\n\nA pandemic would be expected to confine millions of people to their homes for weeks or months, shutting down much of the economy.\n\nTechniques to dilute the vaccine while preserving a strong immune response are under study. In the most optimistic scenario, the stockpile due by February might be diluted to cover 120 million people out of a U.S. population of 298 million. Some preliminary research suggests that dilution will work, but scientists said larger studies are needed. How well the vaccine, diluted or not, would prevent influenza in a pandemic remains uncertain.\n\n“I didn’t realize there was so much going on,” said Charles M. Helms, a University of Iowa doctor and chairman of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, which heard reports on the government’s efforts at a meeting in Washington yesterday. “It’s incredible.”\n\nWilliam Hall, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, said the government has made it a point not to claim that vaccine dilution would produce a huge stockpile in the short run, since the studies needed to prove that are still underway. “We’re trying to stretch the supply of vaccine, but to be perfectly honest, if a pandemic occurs tomorrow, we can cover 4 million people,” he said.\n\nA fast-spreading form of influenza that sickens mostly birds but can also kill people has provoked worldwide alarm.\n\nSo far the virus cannot jump readily from person to person. But scores of people, mostly in Asia, have caught it from birds, and it has killed half of them. Authorities fear that the virus will evolve to the point that it can spread readily in the human population.\n\nThe influenza pandemic of 1918 killed perhaps 50 million people worldwide in months. President Bush announced a plan Nov. 1 to prepare the nation for a pandemic, and Congress is considering his request for more than $7 billion in emergency funds.\n\nThere is no licensed human vaccine today, and standard vaccine against annual flu would offer little protection. Several countries, including the United States, are rushing to develop and stockpile a vaccine. The government also is stockpiling Tamiflu, a drug that might be used to treat infected people, but for prevention, a vaccine is the preferred approach.\n\nThe effort is fraught with uncertainties, however. The experimental vaccine is designed to immunize people against the viral strain circulating in birds, but it is unclear how much protection it would provide if the virus evolved to spread readily among humans.\n\nMultiple human tests are underway, and Linda C. Lambert, chief of respiratory diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said researchers would offer some results soon. But scientists do not expect hard data on the number of deaths the vaccine could prevent to be available until a pandemic outbreak.\n\nSanofi Pasteur SA of Lyon, France, and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., are making the experimental vaccine under government contract. Several companies are working on more advanced vaccines that might offer strong protection with one shot, but those are years away.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   China reports 30th bird flu outbreak\n\n   Posted in China, News, Asia by Future Health Solutions -

China said there was no        SARS-like cover-up surrounding bird flu and said the nation was \"capable\" of stopping the deadly disease from spreading easily among humans. \n\n Health Minister Gao Qiang said there would be no repeat of the 2003 scenario in which local governments did not openly report accurate figures about the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) until months after the outbreaks.\n\n  \"There’s no such covering up of bird flu transmissions in China,\" Gao told reporters at a news briefing.\n\n  \"Once there is an outbreak, we will inform the public immediately and tell the public to be more prepared.\"\n\n  The SARS epidemic eventually spread to several countries, killing more than 800 people, including including 349 in China.\n\n Gao said authorities in China, the world’s most populous nation, would be able to prevent the disease from spreading easily among humans.\n\n  \"We have the determination and the capability to control the large scale spread of bird flu to humans,\" he said.\n\n Gao, however, acknowledged there were still weak links in the nation’s prevention system, saying the ability of health officials at local levels might not be high enough to detect cases in a timely manner.\n\n \"I’m not worried about local governments hiding outbreaks, but I’m worried about our grassroots health and disease-prevention personnel not being able to find and confirm cases in a timely manner due to the low-level of competency and poor technical expertise,\" Gao said.\n\n \"Because bird flu outbreaks are mostly in rural areas, some in remote mountainous areas, where local health conditions are rather poor and local staff are not very competent.\"\n\n It was crucial, then, for the health ministry to work closely with agriculture departments in local areas to step up training of medical staff there so they can identify and diagnose the disease quickly, Gao said.\n\n  Gao also said the total number of outbreaks had reached 30 in China this year, affecting 11 provinces.\n\n  The agriculture ministry announced Wednesday a 30th outbreak in Xinyuan county in the nation’s westernmost Xinjiang region.\n\n Some 300 farm raised birds died in the Biesituobie village on November 24, leading to the culling of some 1.18 million farm raised birds within a three kilometer (1.8 mile) radius of the village, the ministry said.\n\n  The outbreak was confirmed as the H5N1 strain of bird flu on Wednesday, it said.\n\n  China this month confirmed its first three human cases of bird flu, two of which were fatal.\n\n There was no change in the number of human cases Gao said, adding that none of the people who had contact with the three patients, including two who died, showed any symptoms.\n\n China is the biggest poultry producer in the world with 14 billion poultry farmed annually, and the fact 70 percent of the fowl are raised in backyard farms with close proximity to humans worries international health experts. \n\n   The lethal H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus has killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003. \n\nScientists warn that continued contact between infected birds and humans may eventually result in the virus mutating into a form that could be easily passed on by humans, sparking a pandemic that could kill millions. \n\nIn related news, nine people have been arrested for selling fake bird flu vaccines that are suspected to have contributed to an outbreak of the disease in the northeastern province of Liaoning, state press said Wednesday. \n\nPolice have arrested officials of the Jinyu Group, a company based in Inner Mongolia that produces medicines, and of the Inner Mongolian Biological Medical Products Factory, the Liaoxi Commercial Daily reported. \n\nAfter a 20-day investigation covering four provinces and regions, police found the two companies had manufactured and sold 200,000 vials of 12 different kinds of bird flu vaccine nationwide, the report said. \n\nChina is seeking to vaccinate its billions of farm raised birds, but requires manufacturers to have a license to produce the vaccines. \n\n   Liaoning has been one of the worst hit areas in China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   Kenya Broadcasting Corporation: Kenya certified free of bird flu\n\n   Posted in News, Africa, Kenya by Future Health Solutions -

The main players in Australia are Toll Holdings and Patrick Corp. \n\nBusiness ethicist John Sweeney said the analysis had the hallmarks of Gordon Gekko, the character played by Michael Douglas in the film Wall Street. Gekko famously said: \"Greed is good.\" \n\n\"This makes your blood go cold,\" said Mr Sweeney, leader of the Edmund Rice Business Ethics Initiative.  \n\nMr Sweeney also said that market behaviour may need to be regulated in the event of a bird flu pandemic.  \n\nJames Thier, who oversees a $380 million portfolio at Australian Ethical Investment, said Citigroup should have kept its advice to \"positive stocks\" like vaccine makers and pathology. \n\n\"These people are looking at avian flu and saying that these are potential winners for us.  \n\n\"They are looking at the negative side,\" Mr Thier said. \"But this needs to be approached from a positive perspective rather than saying, ‘How can we profit from millions of deaths?’.\" \n\nIn research called Setting the Scene for Aussie Stocks 2006 (Part 2), Citigroup’s Adrian Blundell-Wignall and Alison Tarditi present their \"Avian Flu Thinking\". \n\nA sub-head follows: \"Event Risk Scenarios for Possible Human Pandemic.\" Underneath is a flow-chart which contemplates both mild and \"virulent\" pandemics. \n\nUnder the virulent scenario, there would be \"protracted [economic] weakness as fundamentals deteriorate\", so clients should move to a \"very defensive\" investment strategy. \n\n\"What is interesting from the perspective of playing the avian flu them [sic] is to find stocks that we would like anyway, because of value, growth and/or a solid ranking on our accruals screen, but would benefit disproportionately if the virulent pandemic case emerged as a risk case,\" the former Reserve Bank boffins conclude. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   California: State tries to save bird flu drug for those most vulnerable to illness\n\n   Posted in United States, News, North America by Future Health Solutions - Spence on November 30th, 2005 \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tState tries to save bird flu drug  for those most vulnerable to illness\n \t\t\t     \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t     \t\t\t     \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t    \n\n\t                           By Rebecca Vesely, STAFF WRITER          \n\n\n    \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\n\n\n\n\t \n\t Doctors should refrain from prescribing the drug Tamiflu to patients worried about a potential avian flu pandemic, the state urged in new guidelines issued Tuesday.\nTamiflu is an antiviral that has been shown to reduce symptoms in people infected with the H5N1 virus, known as bird flu. It is in short supply worldwide. \n\n\"It’s important to make sure that the drug is available now for those who really need it,\" said Dr. Mark Horton, the state health officer, in a statement. \n\nThe highest priority for Tamiflu is for the elderly, young children and people with chronic illnesses who come down with the seasonal flu, according to the guidelines issued by the state Department of Health Services. \n\nPeople with high risk of developing complications from seasonal flu who have been exposed to the virus, such as those living in nursing homes, should also have priority access to the drug, the state said. \n\nDr. Julie Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has repeatedly said that enough Tamiflu and similar antiviral drugs will be available this flu season for those who need them. \n\nStill, the drug is in great demand. The federal government has stockpiled 2.3 million doses in an event of a pandemic flu, less than other developed countries. U.S. health \n\n officials said Roche will deliver more in the coming months.\n\nPresident Bush has called for spending  \n\n$1 billion to stockpile antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu as part of his $7.1 billion pandemic flu plan.  \n\nSwiss drugmaker Roche has in recent days permitted the countries of Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines to produce the drugwithout a license because its patent isn’t protected in those countries. \n\n The H5N1 virus, or bird flu, has infected millions of birds and killed 63 people in Southeast Asia and China, according to the World Health Organization. No birds or humans in the United States have been infected. \n\n California health officials expressed concern that \"indiscriminate and inappropriate use of Tamiflu may promote the development and spread of resistance among influenza viruses.\" \n\n The California Medical Association has had no reports of doctors overprescribing Tamiflu and endorses the guidelines, said CMA spokesman Peter Warren. \n\n\n Contact Rebecca Vesely at rvesely@angnewspapers.com.                                              \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   Thailand: WHO: Culling wild birds ineffective against avian flu\n\n   Posted in News, Asia, Thailand by Future Health Solutions - Spence on November 30th, 2005 \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWHO: Culling wild birds ineffective against avian flu\n  \n The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) today issued a media release that warned against culling wild birds in cities in countries affected by bird flu. WHO said this could distract attention from the campaign to contain the disease among poultry in the battle against the virus that could spark a potentially lethal human pandemic. \n\n “This is unlikely to make any significant contribution to the protection of humans against avian influenza,” FAO senior officer responsible for infectious animal diseases Juan Lubroth said of reports that wild birds were being killed in Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam as a precautionary measure. \n\n “There are other, much more important measures to be considered that deserve priority attention. Fighting the disease in poultry must remain the main focus of attention,” he added. “Wild bird species found in and around cities are different from the wetland waterfowl that have been identified as carriers of the avian influenza virus.” \n\n The Agency has previously warned that the H5N1 strain that has hit several Asian countries is likely to be carried over long distances along the flyways of wild water birds to the Middle East, Europe, South Asia and Africa, with the potential to trigger a global human pandemic.\n\n “Controlling the virus in poultry is the most effective way by which the likelihood of the bird flu virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility can be reduced,” Mr. Lubroth said.\n\n Ever since the first human case of H5N1, linked to widespread poultry outbreaks in Viet Nam and Thailand, was reported in January last year, UN health officials have warned that the virus could evolve into a human pandemic if it mutates into a form which could transmit easily between people. \n\n The so-called Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920 is estimated to have killed from 20 million to 40 million people worldwide. Overall, there have been 132 reported human H5N1 cases, 68 of them fatal, all in South-East and East Asia. Some 150 million domestic birds have died or been culled in an effort to curb the spread.\n\n FAO, along with the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the inter-governmental World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has recommend a series of measures to fight the virus, including improved veterinary services, emergency preparedness plans, and control campaigns such as culling infected animals, vaccination and compensation for farmers to encourage them to report outbreaks.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   Phillipines: Commentary: Government drive vs avian flu intensified\n\n   Posted in News, Asia, Phillipines by Future Health Solutions - Spence on November 30th, 2005 \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11/30/2005\n\nCommentary: Government drive vs avian flu intensified\n\n   \n\nBy Marivic A. Alcober  \n\nTacloban City (30 November) — To keep the region free from avian flu or bird flu, an intensified information campaign is presently being undertaken through the coordinated efforts of the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Health (DoH), and the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) all of region 8. Said information drive is being conducted through press releases, guestings in radio programs and TV Talk Shows and through conduct of fora. \n\nDA regional offices are instructed by Secretary Domingo F. Panganiban to coordinate with their Local Government Units to intensify its monitoring and at the same time check illegal entry of wild birds, poultry and meat products from other areas. \n\nOn the national level, preparedness plan is being undertaken in line with Avian Flu Protection Program as directed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Regional awareness is being established from municipal down to the bureaucracy levels to effectively protect the people from this threat to their livelihood and from this deadly virus. \n\nAt present, region 8 is not considered as a bird flu virus critical area due to the absence of a bird sanctuary, however, DA-8 Dir. Leo Cañeda advises the public to be more vigilant due to the presence of migratory bird sites in some towns in the region. \n\nOn their part, DENR Regional Director Leonardo R. Sibbaluca directed their Provincial Community Environment & Natural Resources Officers to conduct close monitoring, specifically in San Juan and Maasin to prevent the entry of wild birds coming from other countries. \n\nDENR field officers were likewise instructed by Dir. Sibbaluca to conduct surveillance on areas where migratory species congregate, and to immediately report any occurrence of high incidence of wild bird mortality. \n\nThe PIA, through its Regional Director Erlinda Olivia P. Tiu have been inviting representatives from DA, DENR and the DOH to guest in their regular \"Harampang ha PIA\", a press conference with the media, and their TV Talk Show \"Panindugan\" as a tool for information dissemination relative to this virus. \n\nAvian influenza or bird flu is a contagious disease of animals caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. Avian influenza viruses are highly species-specific, but have on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. \n\nIn the current outbreak, laboratory confirmed human cases have been reported in the following countries: Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Hongkong, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea and Taiwan. \n\nPeople become affected by the virus through indirect contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their feces, is presently considered the main route of human infection. \n\nIn areas free of the disease, poultry and poultry products can be prepared and consumed as usual, with no fear of acquiring infection with said virus, however, good hygiene practices and proper cooking is advised. In areas experiencing outbreaks, poultry and poultry products can also be safely consumed provided these items are properly handled during food preparation. Consumers are advised that all parts of the poultry are fully cooked, and that eggs, too, are properly cooked.

This strategy outlines how our nation will prepare, detect, and respond to a pandemic, whether it results from the strain currently in birds in Asia or another influenza virus.\n\nPandemic flu is a global outbreak of flu that occurs when a new flu virus appears in people, causes serious illness, and spreads easily from person to person. On average, pandemic flu occurs about every 30 to 40 years. The last pandemic flu occurred in 1968, and medical experts believe one may occur sometime in the near future. The avian flu strain H5N1 is the virus currently considered to be the most likely to cause a new flu pandemic. Scattered cases of H5N1 have occurred among people in direct contact with sick poultry or who ate undercooked poultry infected with the virus. So far, direct person-to-person spread of this virus has not been a problem.\n\nWe know that many of you are concerned about the avian flu and a possible pandemic. For that reason, we have created the Avian Flu Web page with frequently asked questions, glossary of important terms and health-related information.  The site includes other federal government links.  We will continue to add information as it becomes available.\n\nWhat should I do now to protect myself and my family?  While seasonal flu vaccines do not protect against avian flu, getting vaccinated against seasonal flu is an important part of maintaining good body resistance and staying healthy overall. This is particularly important for high-risk groups (the very young, old, and those with chronic diseases) to decrease the overall risk of viral infection and possible complications. Use other personal protective measures such as frequent hand washing, covering coughs and staying home when sick.\n\nIn the past few months, DoD assistance to civil authorities during recent natural disasters has demonstrated that, when directed, we are able to respond with a wide array of capabilities to support the nation during times of need. With these same capabilities and others, we stand ready to assist in the event of a pandemic.\n\nLinks:\n\n\tNational Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.\n\tFederal Government Pandemic Flu Information\n\n\nReminders:\n\n\tIf you feel sick, stay at home and away from others.  Stay away from people who are sick.\n\tCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and put your used tissue in the wastebasket. If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or the inner part of your elbow, not in your hands.\n\tWash your hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing. Wash with soap and water or clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand cleaner. In addition, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth as much as possible.\n\tGet regular exercise, enough rest, and eat healthy, balanced meals. Because tobacco use has been associated with a greater risk of severe complications from certain lung infections, you should avoid smoking.\n\tAs an added measure persons 65 years of age or older, should consult with a healthcare provider to be immunized with pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine, as should people with chronic or other special risk factors.\n\n\nOther sites:\n\n\tU.S. Agency for International Development\n\tDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\tUSDA\n\tDepartment of State\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   Regulators cooperate in speeding bird flu vaccines - Yahoo!

Several countries in the region are regularly reporting more suspected cases in people and outbreaks in poultry.\n\nAnnual flu kills about 250,000 people globally in an average year.\n\nScientists fear H5N1 could kill millions of people if it mutates into a form that passes easily among humans. The regular flu vaccine is useless against avian flu and there is no cure, although drugs can help reduce its severity.\n\nSeveral companies are producing an experimental H5N1 vaccine, but hundreds of millions if not billions of doses would be needed if there were a pandemic. Flu vaccine production, now based on chicken eggs, is slow, unwieldy and uncertain.\n\nSince flu viruses mutate so quickly, any vaccine made now would almost certainly provide poor protection against whatever strain eventually causes a pandemic, meaning a new vaccine would need to be formulated.\n\nInternational officials have been warning for years about the dangers of influenza and the poor structures in place to defend against epidemics and pandemics.\n\nThe weaknesses were highlighted last year when British regulators took away Chiron Corp.’s license to make vaccine at its British plant — costing the United States nearly half its anticipated flu vaccine supply. The British move took the FDA by surprise.\n\nNO SURPRISES\n\nOfficials do not want any such surprises if H5N1 or any other strain of influenza does cause a pandemic.\n\nGoodman said the FDA had been in discussions with the        World Health Organization and other regulatory agencies about how to coordinate approval of a vaccine against H5N1 or some other strain of pandemic flu.\n\n“Vaccine manufacturing is no longer a U.S. issue — it is a global problem,” Goodman said.\n\nHe said there were plans for two global regulatory meetings early next year, the first probably in Canada and a second in the United States. Issues would include what criteria are needed for approving new flu vaccines.\n\n“The differences are not dramatic,” he said.\n\nAnother benefit would be global agreement on approval of the annual influenza vaccine, he said. Companies will only make pandemic flu vaccine if they can use the facilities to make annual flu vaccine, Goodman said.\n\n“Nobody is going to produce 600 million doses every 50 years and then every 49 years something else,” he said.\n\n“The ideal thing would to be perpetually prepared for a pandemic, not just this year when everybody happens to be really freaking out about it.”\n\nThe regulators may release written guidance on the criteria for approving a new vaccine, and Goodman said the FDA was making similar moves in one-on-one meetings with flu vaccine manufacturers.\n\n“We have adapted to what I think are extraordinary circumstances through a number of extraordinary actions,” Goodman said.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPermalink | Comments\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t« Previous entries\t\t · \t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t \t\tPages\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\t\tAbout Future Health Solutions\tContact Us\t\n\n\n\n\tAbout Site\tArchives\t\n\tCalendar\t\n\tCategories\t\n\tLinks\t\n\tRecent News\t\n\tSearch\t\n\n\n\n\tAvian Flu\t What is a Pandemic?\t\n\tFrequently Asked Questions\t\n\tMortality Rates\t\n\tPandemic Preparation Documents\t\n\tPandemic Stages\t\tPhase 1: Interpandemic Period\t\t\n\tPhase 2: Interpandemic Phase\t\t\n\tPhase 3: Pandemic Alert\t\t\n\tPhase 4: Pandemic Alert\t\t\n\tPhase 5: Pandemic Alert\t\t\n\tPhase 6: PANDEMIC\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \t\tCategories\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\t\tBird Flu Humor (2)\n\n\tBusiness Planning (18)\n\n\tDepartment of Health and Human Services (1)\n\n\tDetection, Treatment & Planning (356)\n\t\t\tAnti-Virals (139)\n\n\tClinical Treatment (15)\n\n\tDiagnostic kits (14)\n\n\tEducation (1)\n\n\tEthics (2)\n\n\tHospitals (16)\n\n\tInfection Control (20)\n\n\tLong Term Care/Nursing Homes (7)\n\n\tPandemic Preparation/ Self Care (13)\n\n\tQuarantine (3)\n\n\tSchools (3)\n\t\t\tPublic Schools (3)\n\n\n\n\n\tScientific Studies (32)\n\n\tSpecimen Handling (2)\n\n\tSurveillance Guidelines (12)\n\n\tSymptoms (9)\n\n\tTools - Pandemic Impact (6)\n\n\tVaccines (156)\n\t\t\tDevelopment (129)\n\n\tPriority Groups (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tDocuments and Links (33)\n\t\t\tComprehensive Responsive Plans (24)\n\n\tFrequently Asked Questions (25)\n\n\n\n\n\tFinancial Impact (77)\n\t\t\tBusiness Impact (30)\n\n\tBusiness Preparation (29)\n\n\n\n\n\tGovernment/ Public Health (71)\n\t\t\tA.

Those Parts confer permitted development rights in respect of certain telecommunications development, including the erection of satellite antennas. Where such rights apply, no specific application for planning permission is needed.\n\n\nArticle 2 amends Part 1 of the 1995 Order (development within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse) as regards the size limit of a satellite antenna installed on or within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse (other than on a chimney) pursuant to permitted development rights. It applies throughout England and Wales a size limit for such an antenna of 90 centimetres (measured in any direction).\n\n\nArticle 3 amends Part 24 of the 1995 Order (development by telecommunications code system operators). It disapplies permitted development rights in respect of the installation, alteration or replacement of apparatus on a mast where the height of the mast would, as a result of that installation, alteration or replacement, be increased above specified limits. It modifies existing exclusions from such rights to permit in certain circumstances the installation, alteration or replacement of small antennas on a building. A small antenna is defined in article 3(h) as an antenna which is used in connection with a telephone system operating on a point to fixed multi-point basis, and which does not exceed 50 centimetres in any linear measurement or have an area exceeding 1,591 square centimetres.\n\n\nArticle 4 amends Part 25 of the 1995 Order (other telecommunications development) by raising the maximum size limit for satellite antennas on buildings or structures of a height of 15 metres or more to 1.3 metres.\n\n\nMinor incidental and consequential changes are also made to the Parts mentioned.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n[1] \n1990 c.8; to which there are no relevant amendments.back\n\n[2] \nS.I. 1995 No. 418; to which there are no relevant amendments.back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISBN \n0 11 065615 6\n\n\n\n\n\t?\n\n\n\t\n\nOther UK SIs?|?\nHome?|?\nNational Assembly for Wales Statutory Instruments?|?\nScottish Statutory Instruments?|?\nStatutory Rules of Northern Ireland?|?\nHer Majesty's Stationery Office\n\n\t\n\n\t\nWe welcome your comments on this site\n\t?

          "Defra, UK - Environmental Protection - Recycling and Waste \nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\n \nThe Producer Responsibility Regulations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997:\nRecovery and Recycling Targets for Packaging Waste in 2001\n(Regulatory Impact Assessment)\n \n\n\n\n\nPurpose and intended effects of the measures\n\n\nIssue and Objective\n\n\n1.\tThe Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 No. 648 as amended in 1999 (1999 No. 1361 and 1999 No. 3447) were introduced to implement the EC Directive on packaging and packaging waste (94/62/EC) (\"the Packaging Directive\") in Great Britain. \n\n\n2.\tThe targets that appear in the 1997 Regulations were based on early and incomplete information about the tonnage of packaging in the waste stream and about the number of businesses obligated as well as those excluded. The experience accumulated since 1998 has allowed a better understanding of the total quantity of packaging in the waste stream and it has also provided data on the amount of packaging reported by obligated businesses.\n\n\n3.\tConsultation took place in 1998 on changing the targets for 1999, 2000 and 2001 but in announcing revised business targets for 1999 and 2000, the Minister kept open the possibility of changing the business targets for 2001 at a later date. \n\n\n4.\tOn the basis of the data reported from obligated businesses in 1999, the Government published in August 2000 a further Consultation Paper on Recovery and Recycling Targets for Packaging Waste in 2001 (Consultation Paper) proposing to raise UK business targets from 52% (recovery target) and 16% (material specific target) to 58% and 18%. On the basis on the data available at the time, 58% and 18% were the targets necessary to achieve the Packaging Directive targets of 50% and 15%.\n\n\n5.\tThe Government completed a general review of the data used in the Consultation Paper in the light of the now available more recent data reported in 2000 from obligated businesses, revised estimates for total packaging in the waste stream from Materials Organisations (MOs) and responses to the Consultation Paper.\n\n\n6.\tAs a result of this review the Government intends to raise the targets to 56% (recovery target) and 18% (material specific target). Such changes to the targets are now felt necessary in order to ensure that the current level of targets for 2001 in the Regulations are sufficient for the UK to meet its mandatory obligations under the EC Packaging Directive.\n\n\n7.\tThis RIA has been prepared by considering the overall UK-wide costs of the proposed changes to the packaging regime as it is difficult to separate the cost directly applicable to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, the amending legislation to implement the changes is planned to be made by separate Regulations in Scotland and Northern Ireland from England and Wales. It would therefore be useful if a separate assessment of Scottish and Northern Ireland cost implications can be made, although without further information, the best estimate is that costs in Scotland will be of the order of 10% of the UK total and that costs in Northern Ireland will be in the order of 2.5% of the UK total.\n\n\nRisk Assessment\n\n\n8.\tThe targets need to be increased in order to achieve the UK's mandatory targets set in the Packaging Directive. Failure to meet the targets could potentially result in infraction proceedings against the UK which may result in a judgement from the European Court of Justice and possibly the imposition of financial penalties on the UK. \n\n\n9.\tFurther risks associated with not meeting the current targets set in the Packaging Directive include the extra environmental disamenity generated by the landfilling of packaging waste that could be recovered. \n\n\nOptions\n\n\nIdentify the Options\n\n\n10.\tTwo options have been identified after the review of all the data in the Consultation Paper issued in August 2000 and after the consideration of the results of consultancy work.\n\n\n\n\tOption 1 – Keep the planned recovery/recycling targets for 2001\n\tOption 2 – Change the planned recovery/recycling targets for 2001\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this RIA, Option 1 (the status quo) is the counterfactual. Option 2 will be assessed relative to this baseline.\n\n\nOption 1\n\n\n11.\tTargets for 2001 are left at the current level of 52% overall recovery and within this 16% for each specific material by recycling (except for wood and other).\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n12.\tTargets are increased to a level necessary to ensure compliance with the Packaging Directive, namely 56% overall recovery and 18% for each specific material by recycling (except for wood and other).\n\n\nIssues of Equity and Fairness\n\n\n13.\tOption 2 will impact across all obligated companies. The impact on each sector will be proportional to the sectoral split of obligations already set in the Regulations. In addition, the material specific recycling target will have a varying impact on different materials sectors given the current differences in recycling levels of each material. There will be no burden on small businesses as the Regulations already include safeguards for smaller businesses. (See section \"Impact on Small Businesses\" at the end)\n\n\n14.\tHowever it should be noted that a trade-off exists between avoiding extra burdens on smaller businesses and the proportional burden placed on obligated businesses (i.e. businesses above the thresholds). Targets apply to all the packaging waste in the waste stream, therefore, the more exclusions there are to protect smaller businesses and others, such as charities, the higher the burden on obligated businesses to recover and recycle the required percentage of packaging waste.\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\nIdentify the benefits\n\n\nOption 1\n\n\n15.\tObligated businesses will not be affected further than the current Regulations require. Their costs and planning efforts on how to meet their recovery obligation for packaging waste in 2001 will not increase more than was expected in 1997.\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n16.\tThe benefits of option 2 are:\n\n\n\n\tto ensure that the legally binding targets set in the Packaging Directive are met, ensuring that the adverse legal and public opinion consequences of failing to meet the EU mandatory recovery/recycling targets are avoided;\n\tto further reduce the impact on the environment of packaging waste; to provide an higher level of environmental protection.\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying and valuing the benefits\n\n\nOption 1\n\n\n17.\tThis is the baseline scenario against which the benefits of option 2 will be assessed. This option will deliver a total recovery of about 4,413,000t of waste packaging in 2001. This will deliver 47.4% recovery of packaging waste. This would fall below the legally binding target of 50% in the Packaging Directive and some material specific targets as laid down in the Packaging Directive would not be met.\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n18.\tPotential infraction proceedings together with a possible eventual penalty from the ECJ for non-compliance with the Packaging Directive will be avoided assuming that obligated businesses meet the revised targets. The benefit of avoiding this is hard to quantify but the ECJ could potentially impose daily financial penalties based on the UK's GDP. Adverse public opinion for not meeting EU mandatory recycling targets for packaging waste will also be avoided. The benefit of avoiding this is hard to quantify. It Is difficult to value the environmental benefits of a reduction of the environmental impact of packaging waste. Environmental benefits could result from a reduction in the amounts of waste going to landfill whilst the production of recyclate might mitigate against the use of virgin materials. Hence  the greater recovery and recycling of option 2, (compared to option 1) could potentially reduce emissions to air, soil and water. This is an objective that underlies the UK's vision of sustainable development.\n\n\n19.\tThis option is expected to deliver a total recovery of about 4,750,000t of waste packaging in 2001. This is expected to deliver 51.0% recovery of packaging waste which, after taking into account the uncertainty in estimates (including the possibility that some tonnages reported by the smaller businesses may go down in 2001), will ensure that the legally binding target of 50% in the Packaging Directive is met and that all material specific targets as laid down in the Packaging Directive are met.\n\n\nCompliance costs for business, charities and voluntary organisations\n\n\nBusiness sectors affected\n\n\n20.\tThe only sectors that will be affected by this proposal are those already obligated under the Regulations and those carrying out recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The sectors obligated under the Regulations are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\tManufacturing packaging raw materials\n\n\n\n\n\tConverting materials into packaging\n\n\n\n\n\tUsing packaging to pack or wrap products\n\n\n\n\n\tSelling packaging to the final consumers\n\n\n\n\n\tImporting packaging materials, packaging or packaged goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the Regulations place an obligation on approximately 14,000 firms. In addition, businesses which carry out recovery and recycling of packaging waste will be affected. In total there are approximately 210 such businesses.\n\n\n\nCompliance costs for a \"typical\" business\n\n\n21.\tCharities as defined in Section 506 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are exempt from the Regulations. De-minimus businesses (those below the threshold limits of £2 million turnover and 50 tonnes of packaging handled) will also not face any compliance costs, as they are not affected by the Regulations. \n\n\nOption 1\n\n\n22.\tOption 1 will not result in compliance costs in addition to those anticipated in 1997 under the current Regulations. Estimated costs are around £11,000 per business on average.  (This is obtained by dividing the number of businesses estimated to be obligated (14,000) for the total cost of compliance of Option 1 (£155,000,000))\n\n\n23.\tHowever, smaller obligated businesses and larger obligated businesses are likely to experience a lower or higher cost respectively as a result of the smaller or larger number of packaging tonnes handled respectively.\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n24.\tIt is difficult to estimate the compliance costs for a typical business as this varies enormously according to the type of business (manufacturer, converter, packer-filler and distributor) and the total tonnage of packaging handled. On a per firm basis, option 2 (see below) will imply an \"average\" increase of about 8.5% in the cost of compliance with the Regulations. This has been calculated by estimating an 'average' compliance cost.\n\n\n25.\tDividing the estimated additional cost under this option by the number of estimated obligated firms (14,000) gives average total compliance cost of £930 per firm.\n\n\n26.\tHowever, smaller obligated businesses and larger obligated businesses are likely to experience a lower or higher cost respectively as a result of the smaller or larger number of packaging tonnes handled respectively. Furthermore, businesses that use different materials may incur different costs.\n\n\n27.\tFurthermore, some businesses and compliance schemes may be aware that targets are likely to increase in 2001 if the UK is to meet its legally binding targets under the Packaging Directive. Therefore, it is possible that businesses and compliance schemes will be able to reduce their future costs by planning in advance to meet higher targets.\n\n\nTotal Compliance costs\n\n\nOption 1\n\n\n28.\tThere are legal and public opinion consequences of not meeting the mandatory EU targets. In the extreme this would amount to a daily fine payable until the situation has been rectified. The total cost of recycling and recovery under option 1 is estimated to be £155,000,000 (excluding any fines imposed by the ECJ). There is some uncertainty surrounding these costs; assumptions and calculations underling this estimates are presented in Appendix A.\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n29.\tThe total cost of complying with option 2 is estimated to be £168,000,000. There is some uncertainty surrounding these costs; assumptions and calculations underling this estimate are presented in Appendix A. Thus the cost to firms of complying with option 2 is £ 13,000,000 more than the cost of complying with option 1.\n\n\nConsultation with small businesses: 'The Litmus Test'\n\n\n30.\tBusinesses that do not simultaneously satisfy the two thresholds of the Regulations (i.e. businesses with an annual turnover of £2m or less; and those handling 50t or less of packaging per annum) are excluded from the obligation to recover and recycle waste packaging.  Therefore the proposed changes to the level of targets do not affect small businesses below this threshold.\n\n\nOther costs\n\n\n31.\tAs the reporting and recycling obligations are already in place, apart from some one-off adjustment costs, there are no other costs of compliance to businesses due to proposed changes in the level of recovery/recycling targets.\n\n\nResult of Consultation\n\n\n32.\tResponses to the Consultation Paper on Recovery and Recycling Targets for Packaging Waste in 2001 have been carefully analysed. They have highlighted few imprecision in the Consultation Paper and they have informed our revision of the data and estimates presented in the paper itself.\n\n\n33.\tThere were 171 responses to the consultation. These included individual businesses, trade associations (e.g. British Retail Consortium, Food and Drink Federation, Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association); and compliance schemes.  With few exceptions, all responses oppose the proposed target of 58% recovery. There were a limited number of themes which were mentioned by most of those responding.  The main themes are -\n\n\n\n\tlast-minute increase is unfair to those who have complied so far;\n\tincrease only needed because the Agency has not deterred free-riders; those complying should not have to compensate for non-compliers;\n\tlower turnover threshold test to £1million;\n\tinsufficient infrastructure to cope with the required increaset;\n\tnot enough time to meet a 58% target.\n\n\n\n\n34.\tA number of responses comment on the fact that there has been insufficient investment in the recycling infrastructure, yet some £110 million has been paid for PRNs in 1998 and 1999 alone. We will be asking the Advisory Committee to focus as a priority on the reprocessing infrastructure.\n\n\n35.\tA number of responses suggest reverting to a £1million turnover threshold.  Industry thinks this will bring in a lot more businesses but it would also bring in relatively small amounts of packaging, could increase compliance costs and would require a significantly greater monitoring effort on the part of the Agencies.\n\n\nAppendix A\n\n\nEstimating the cost to firms of complying with options 1& 2\n\n\n36.\tIn order to estimate the total cost to business of compliance with both options 1 and 2, it is assumed that the cost of recycling one tonne of material is equal to the average price of a PRN for that material. Furthermore it is assumed that non-material specific recycling for 2001 is distributed across different materials according to the percentage split of 1999. To calculate the difference in costs between option 1 and option 2 one can assess the costs assuming PRN prices remain the same under both options (i.e. assuming that raising to 56% and 18% instead of 52% and 16% the targets does not raise the price of PRNs). To this can then be added the resulting costs should PRN prices be higher under option 2 than under option 1.\n\n\nCosts assuming no difference in the PRN prices between the two options\n\n\n37.\tThe following needs to be estimated:\n\n\na)\tthe average price of PRNs in 2001;\n\nb)\tthe percentage split of non-specific recycling across different materials in 2001.\n\n\na)\tthe likely average price of PRNs in 2001\n\n\n38.\tThe average of price of a PRN in 1998 has been used to estimate an average price of a PRN in 2001. (Such assumption is considered more appropriate than using or including the average price for 1999 as 1999 prices were generally lower than the 1998 prices, and higher prices are expected for 2001. PRN prices are expected to rise as targets rise from the 2000 level (45% recovery, 13% material specific recycling). The estimated prices are used for both option 1 and option 2. However, due to more stringent targets, PRN prices may rise higher under option two, this factor is estimated in section \"Cost assuming difference in the PRN prices between the two options)  The average (1998) prices used in order to estimate the price of a PRN in 2001 were £112/t for plastic, £21/t for aluminium, £32/t for paper, £22/t for glass and £30/t for steel. Economic theory suggests the price of wood recovery and mixed (incineration) PRNs will be the same. The average (1998) price of an incineration PRN is £31; this price will also be used for wood. The price of £31/t will also be applied to \"other\" materials. These estimate prices are based on average prices for PRNs paid by one compliance scheme during 1998.\n\n\nb)\tthe percentage split of non-specific recycling across different materials in 2001\n\n\n39.\tThe percentage split for non-specific material recycling in 2001 is assumed to be equal to the 1999 percentage splits as 2000 data for recycling achievements will not be available till early 2001. In 1999, these were: 70.75% for paper, 17% for glass, 6.67% for steel, 3.87% for wood, 1.56% for plastic, and 0.15% for aluminium).\n\n\nEstimated cost of OPTION 1\n\n\n40.\tBased on a total for packaging in the waste stream in 2001 of 9,313,900 (as from latest Materials Organisations' estimates) and assuming a split between obligated and non obligated businesses equal to 91,1% and 8,9% respectively, under option 1 the total recovery of packaging waste is estimated to be 4,412,594t. The total recycling (material specific and non-specific material recycling) of packaging waste for 2001 is estimated at 3,887,594 tonnes. In particular at least 544,250t is estimated to be paper; 333,642t is estimated to be glass; 18,277t is estimated to be aluminium; 107,361t is estimated to be steel; 253,408t is estimated to be plastic; 95,148t is estimated to be wood; 5,635t is estimated to be \"other\" and 2,529,873t is estimated to be non-specified material recycling. Packaging recovery from energy from waste is estimated at 525,000t. \n\n\n41.\tThe recycling of non-specified material has been allocated across different materials according to the percentage split estimated in b).\n\n\n42.\tBased on the estimates calculated in a) and b), the total cost of option 1 is estimated to be about £155,000,000.\n\n\nEstimated cost of OPTION 2\n\n\n43.\tBased on a total for packaging in the waste stream in 2001 of 9,313,900 (as from latest Materials Organisations' estimates) and assuming a split between obligated and non obligated businesses equal to 91,1% and 8,9% respectively, under option 2 the total recovery of packaging waste is estimated to be 4,752,024t. The total recycling (material specific and non-specific material recycling) of packaging waste for 2001 is estimated at 4,227,024 tonnes. In particular at least 612,281t is estimated to be paper; 375,347t is estimated to be glass; 20,561t is estimated to be aluminium; 120,782t is estimated to be steel; 285,085t is estimated to be plastic; 107,042t is estimated to be wood; 6,339t is estimated to be \"other\" and 2,699,588t is estimated to be non-specified material recycling. Packaging recovery from energy from waste is estimated at 525,000t. \n\n\n44.\tThe recycling of non-specified material has been allocated across different materials according to the percentage split estimated in b).\n\n\n45.\tBased on the estimates calculated in a) and b), the total cost of option 2 is estimated to be £168,000,000.\n\n\n46.\tThe differential cost between option 1 and option 2 is therefore estimated as £13,000,000.\n\n\nCosts assuming difference in the PRN prices between the two options\n\n\n47.\tAlthough the estimates used for PRN prices (i.e. average prices for 1998) are considerably higher than current market prices in order to allow for increase in prices related to increase in targets, it is possible that PRN prices rise more in Option 2 than Option 1.\n\n\n48.\tCalculating the likely change as a result of raising the targets would be an extremely complicated task and involve considerable uncertainty. Thus, for the purposes of this RIA, the figures should be seen as illustrative.\n\n\n49.\tFor each £1 increase from the average PRN prices in 1998 for each materials estimated in a) (see 28.), the cost of option 2 relative to option 1 will rise by about £4,752,000.\n\n\nTotal cost difference between the two options\n\n\n50.\tThe differential cost between option 1 and option 2 is therefore estimated as £13,000,000 plus £4,752,000 per £1 increase in PRN prices from 1998 average prices for all materials between the two options. Hence:\n\n\n\n\tif PRN prices did not rise above 1998 average the estimated differential cost would be £13,000,000;\n\tif PRN prices rose by an additional £1 on average for all materials in option 2 the estimated differential cost would be £17,752,000;\n\tif PRN prices rose by an additional £5 on average for all materials in option 2 the estimated differential cost would be £35,860,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished 15 January 2001\n\n Waste Index\n\n Environmental Protection Index\n\n Defra Home Page\n\n\n\n",

The aim was to sharpen thinking on UN\nhumanitarian coordination in the light of processes underway in the UN. These include debates on\nhow the UN chooses coordination arrangements, the report of the UN Panel on Peace Operations –\n5\nthe Brahimi report – and OCHA’s own Change Management Process.\nThe purpose of the study is to:\n1. Draw lessons from recent experiences in humanitarian coordination.\n2. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of UN coordination models – that is, the\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator or so-called ‘combined model’, the model where the\nHumanitarian Coordinator is separate from the Resident Coordinator, and the ‘lead agency model’\n– in particular circumstances.\n3. Identify features of coordination arrangements which have provided ‘added value’.\nThe Terms of Reference (ToR) further specified a range of questions on specific aspects of\ncoordination including the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP), access, information, sectoral\ncoordination, strategic monitoring, and the relationship between humanitarian, development, political\nand military actors.\nThe study’s methodology was a review of studies of coordination over the last decade, more than 250\ninterviews with UN, NGOs, the Red Cross Movement, governments, donors and the military, and\nthree case studies of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia and Kosovo, each based on\na week-long visit by the study team. Although the study’s focus was the coordination of, and by, the\nhumanitarian agencies of the UN system, as the range of interviewees suggests, the study drew on\nthe experiences and perspective of all those implicated in UN coordination.\nThe study team encountered a number of constraints, one of which was to address the broad scope\nof the study and do justice to the wealth of material gathered. Interviewees also challenged the ToR’s\nneglect of humanitarian coordination in natural disasters as a perpetuation of the division between\nthose working in and on natural disasters as opposed to complex emergencies.\nSECTION 2: COORDINATION – AN OVERVIEW\n2.1 Historical Overview\nThe UN humanitarian system is composed of six key actors – UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, FAO, WHO\nand UNDP – each established by separate treaties, with its own governance mechanism. The first\nattempt to establish a comprehensive framework to organise this system was General Assembly\nResolution 2816 of 14 December 1971, which created the Office of the UN Disaster Relief\nCoordinator (UNDRO) 'to mobilise, direct and coordinate relief.' UNDRO was not a success, and two\ndecades later, prompted also by dissatisfaction with other ad hoc coordination arrangements and Gulf\nwar experiences, General Assembly Resolution 46/182 was passed.\nResolution 46/182 created the post of Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and the Inter-Agency\nStanding Committee (IASC), among other measures. The following year, the Secretary-General\nestablished the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) headed by the ERC, also designated\nUnder Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. In 1994 the IASC approved ToR for Humanitarian\nCoordinators and in 1997 further refined the options and the criteria to select them. As part of the\n1997 reform programme of Secretary-General Annan, the DHA was replaced by a new office with a\nmore streamlined mandate focused on coordination, advocacy and policy development: OCHA.\n                                                          \n5\n Brahimi, L. (2000) Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations A/55/305 S/2000/809 (United Nations: New York)\nAugust.\niHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nToday, the combined Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator model exists in 14 complex emergencies,\nthe lead agency model in two cases, and six countries have separate Humanitarian Coordinators.\n2.2 Defining Coordination\nWhile defining why coordination is important may be not be contentious within the UN, defining who\ncoordinates and how it is done provokes fierce debate. Distinctions between strategic and operational\ncoordination are used to fight inter-agency battles about who does what, and reinforce the impression\nthat there are areas of humanitarian response that are unrelated to strategy and all that this implies by\nway of analysis, goals and monitoring. Also unresolved is whether coordination is a minimal activity\npreventing duplication and overlap or a more integrating activity that seeks to harmonise responses\nas part of a single programme or strategy.\nOne of the definitions used repeatedly in past studies of coordination stood out as potentially\nuseful to the UN:\nCoordination is the systematic use of policy instruments to deliver humanitarian\nassistance in a cohesive and effective manner. Such instruments include strategic\nplanning, gathering data and managing information, mobilising resources and ensuring\naccountability, orchestrating a functional division of labour, negotiating and maintaining a\n6\nserviceable framework with host political authorities and providing leadership.\nThis definition emphasises coordination functions that are often missing or weak in UN humanitarian\ncoordination. These include:\n• The importance of using policy instruments in systematic ways – that is, in an organised way\naccording to established procedures rather than in an ad hoc manner;\n• The emphasis on cohesion, bringing elements of a response together;\n• The focus on planning, managing information, accountability, functional divisions of labour and\nsustaining frameworks with political authorities.\n2.3 The Changing Context of Humanitarian Coordination\nThis study was required to focus primarily on the conduct of UN coordination within the humanitarian\nsystem. Such an ‘intra-humanitarian’ focus can obscure the significance of political and military actors\nin facilitating or obstructing humanitarian action. The frequent absence or weakness of legitimate\ngovernment to prioritise and implement policy creates the UN’s coordination challenge in the first\nplace. The violence and insecurity facing civilians and those that seek to help them are also\nsickeningly familiar challenges to humanitarian action and its coordination.\nNewer challenges include the increasing fragmentation and bilateral management of resources for\nhumanitarian assistance, and thus a reduction in the share of resources received by the UN.\nHumanitarian aid as a share of rich countries’ wealth is also falling. This is a clarion call for advocacy.\nDonors are making greater demands of humanitarian actors to uphold performance standards and\nincrease accountability. For some, this requires greater field capacity to scrutinise and even\ncoordinate humanitarian activity. Case studies suggest there are some donors – the European\nCommission in particular – who have the capacity and interest to fill any coordination vacuums left by\na discredited or ineffective UN. The consequences of this remain unexplored.\nThe added momentum given to debates on peacebuilding strategies by the Brahimi report, with its as\nyet undefined role for humanitarians in such activities may prove the latest attempt to explicitly coopt\nhumanitarian action to deliver on wider political goals of peace and security. This could have\ncommensurate coordination difficulties as NGOs and other humanitarians are forced to distance\nthemselves explicitly from a non-neutral UN in the interest of preserving their humanitarian identity,\ncentral to efforts to sustain access to civilians in need.\n                                                          \n6\n Minear, L., Chelliah., U, Crisp, J., Mackinlay, J. & Weiss, T.

Watson Institute for International Studies: Providence, Rhode Island)\nOccasional Paper 13.\niiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nSECTION 3: OBSTACLES AND INCENTIVES TO COORDINATION\nWhile the context sketched above presents some of the external challenges to the UN’s coordination\nrole, the study focused in greater detail on challenges more internal to the UN. Past studies,\ninterviews and case studies reveal a picture of structural, institutional and management obstacles to\ncoordination.\n3.1 Structural Obstacles\nAlthough described as a system, there is little about the combined structure of the UN’s funds,\nagencies and programmes that is systematic. Each is required to respond to the often-divergent\nimperatives set by their different governance structures influenced by the political interests of UN\nMember States. In the same way, while donors vociferously demand coordination, donor earmarking,\nmicro-management, visibility concerns and political agendas all thwart it. Donors have also proved\nweak at coordinating themselves.\nUN agencies’ demonstrated preoccupation with securing donor approval further weakens the\ncoordination imperative. The push for profile necessary to attract funding posits sister agencies as\ncompetitors in a market they perceive to be shrinking. OCHA appears particularly vulnerable in this\nenvironment that makes market competitors out of humanitarian collaborators as donor enthusiasm\nfor OCHA appears to correlate directly with UN agency mistrust.\n3.2 Institutional Obstacles\nThe competition for funds exacerbates institutional cultures that foster agency allegiance over system-\nwide loyalty, where staff commitment to coordinated outcomes is neither required nor rewarded.\nAgencies have proved unwilling to release their ‘best people’ for secondment into coordination\nfunctions, preferring to retain them to deliver their agency’s mandate. Some argue that maintaining\neffective agency operations has the greatest direct impact on beneficiaries – the fundamental concern\nfor humanitarians. Yet effective coordination increases the impact of the overall response. Requiring\nstaff to coordinate and seconding skilled staff to play co-ordination roles are essential to the system's\nperformance.\nHowever, where Coordinators are perceived to have vested institutional interests – for instance,\nhaving joint responsibility for operations and coordination – they are likely to attract hostility and be\nunsuccessful in their coordination role. This is also true of the UN system as a whole where some\nagencies are prone to focus on UN matters to the exclusion or neglect of NGOs and the Red Cross\nMovement, who are key players and partners in humanitarian response.\n3.3 Management Obstacles\nWeak management compounds these structural and institutional difficulties. Such weakness is\nmanifest in the ‘adhocracy’ that this study concludes characterises the UN’s coordination. Comparing\none situation to another, there is little that is done in a systematic way. While some claim this shows\nflexibility, it in fact reveals decisions not made, conflicts not resolved, and the influence of politics on\nmanagement decisions. This appears to be true of all levels in the UN. In practice it results in staff\nwith unclear roles, responsibilities, reporting lines and accountabilities, and huge numbers of people\nsent into the field with little induction or guidance on fundamental matters.\nAd interim arrangements are another facet of this ad hoc approach that highlights one of the apparent\nironies of ‘flexible’ arrangements: they are both vulnerable to be changed at any moment, and may be\nleft to fester with dysfunctions going ignored. They are also a prime example of how adhocracy puts a\nhuge onus on individuals to work things out on the ground. On the positive side, not having\nrequirements or systems set in stone offers room for innovation. Negatively, the weak management\n \nassociated with adhocracy allows the incompetent to underperform or create chaos. Such adhocracy\nseems to be built into the UN system, both as a product and cause of the resistance to coordination.\niiiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3.4 The Ingredients of Success\nIn the face of such obstacles, coordination is against the odds. However, coordination does happen\nwhere contexts conducive to coordination dilute the impact of obstacles, such as small\nnumbers of humanitarian agencies, where relationships among agencies have been built over time,\nand where shared technical expertise facilitates communication and increases focus on how to\nachieve shared goals rather than agency profiles.\nCoordination also happens where incentives to coordinate are increased – whether because\nagencies have to work together in the interests of their own security or to achieve access to\nbeneficiaries, or where donor or media scrutiny requires it or supports it. Coordinators vested with\ncontrol of access or funds at critical stages in the response also provided a powerful incentive to\nothers to coordinate, provided these elements were in the hands of those with a mentality of inclusion\nand service-orientation.\nAgencies can be persuaded to coordinate where coordination clearly adds value. A crucial\ningredient here is leadership. Two key elements in leadership are effective managerial skills and\nanalytical skills that offer clarity, structure and direction for both field operations and humanitarian\nadvocacy. The team was struck by the significance of the ‘intellectual route’ to authority and influence\nwithin the UN. Committed, experienced, competent Coordinators who foster trust, build teams, and\nfocus on humanitarian response rather than an agency add value. Yet adding value also depends on\nhaving sufficient and skilled support staff to perform essential coordination functions.\nIf adhocracy is one of the obstacles to coordination, so making coordination more systematic is its\nantidote. Although removing many of the obstacles to coordination depend on the actions of Member\nStates and donors, the above analysis suggests the UN will maximise the likelihood of effective\ncoordination by consistently ensuring that:\n• Coordinators have sufficient competence, management skills, dynamism and vision to give them\nauthority to persuade or encourage others to coordinate.\n• Coordinators have elements of command at their fingertips, such as control over funding and\naccess, in order to increase the incentives or requirements of others to coordinate.\n• Coordination is carried out by those who do not have vested institutional interests but rather\nprovide services for the whole system, and for whom coordination is a full-time job.\n• The Coordinator is supported by skilled staff to perform essential functions and services.\n• There is effective accountability for coordination through clear structures and reporting lines,\nincluding clarity on who deputises for the Coordinator and what his/her responsibilities will be.\nThis requires monitoring and assessment to ensure that good performance is rewarded and poor\nperformance is sanctioned.\nThe benefits of planning in advance, having rosters of available staff and well-written Memoranda of\nUnderstanding (MoUs) are also ingredients of more systematic responses.\nYet there is one further key ingredient for effective humanitarian action and coordination upon\nwhich even the best laid plans and procedures depend: a focus on the people who are in need. No\nstructures or incentives can compensate for lack of commitment to an effective, coordinated response\nto the needs of beneficiaries.\nSECTION 4: THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF COORDINATION MODELS\nThe previous section set out some of essential ingredients of effective coordination, namely that it is\nrecognised as a full-time task requiring particular skills and competencies, and that it must be\n \nresourced, performed and respected as such. The coordination role requires skilled support teams,\nclear lines of accountability for coordination, and that coordination is carried out by players with no\nvested interest who perform a service for whole system.\nivHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThese ingredients should have a bearing on how the UN selects coordination arrangements. They\nprovide clear criteria for any coordination structure to fulfil. Yet the study concluded that the selection\nof coordination arrangements seems only weakly connected with both the lessons from past\nperformance and the demands of the context. The interests of the Secretary-General and the major\nUN operational agencies seem to prevail in decisions that focus on the top of coordination structures\n– that is, how they get led – and pays little attention to specifying what and how coordination services\nand functions are provided. (Tensions around the roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships of\nOCHA field staff are a direct result of this.) Thus the study concludes that the IASC should focus\nmore on specifying the composition, functions and competencies of coordination teams and\nstructures, not solely responsibilities at the top.\nAlthough the study disputes that the models as specified by the UN are the key determinants of\ncoordination outcomes – arguing that the role of host governments or authorities, the actors involved\nin coordination and their respective geographical location, and the nature and frequency of\ncoordination activities are all significant – the study presented assessments of their respective\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nThe combined role of Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator provides a sense of uniformity to\narrangements globally, and can contribute to bridging the relief–development gap. UNDP’s\nwillingness to bear the cost of coordination is another point in its favour. Yet many interviewees\nexpressed doubts about Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators' ability to carry out robust humanitarian\ndiplomacy, for example, on the rights of refugees or IDPs. The fiercest criticism is the lack of\nhumanitarian coordination experience or skills of existing Resident Coordinators. The study concludes\nthat if the Secretary-General and IASC members continue to favour appointing\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinators, this should be accompanied by a number of measures to\nmitigate the disadvantages, including a pool of candidates that are agreed to be suitably qualified,\nmore rigorous performance monitoring, and decisive approaches to replace those not up to the job.\nThe logic behind the use of the lead agency model is undeniable. Where one agency is\noverwhelmingly present, it makes sense to use the infrastructure in place for the benefit of\ncoordination. In theory the model also appears attractive because it comes closest to institutionalising\n‘command functions’ within one agency. However, in practice the evidence suggests that it has not\nbeen possible for an agency with operational responsibilities to coordinate for the benefit of\nthe system. Lead agencies have tended to mould the emergency in their own image, to favour their\nown programme rather than focus on the overall response, and to interpret coordination as control.\nYet lead agencies have insufficient control to compel others to coordinate, and in practice have\nundertaken insufficient consensus-building efforts to persuade others to coordinate. If there were\neffective personnel rosters to establish rapid response coordination teams in the earliest days of an\nemergency, the problematic option of carving capacity out of the lead agency would no longer be\nnecessary.\nThe team concluded that there is a strong case for the IASC to favour the Humanitarian\nCoordinator being separate from the Resident Coordinator. This is not least due to concern at the\ndearth of suitable candidates for the positions of Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator and the slow\npace at which the pool of competent candidates is being enlarged. It also stems from a recognition of\nthe scale of the challenges faced in humanitarian coordination such as the importance of leadership in\novercoming the obstacles to coordination within the UN, and the importance of advocacy and\nnegotiating access. This is so particularly in cases of large-scale rapid onset emergencies where\nterritorial control is divided among belligerents. The team was struck that this opinion was widely held\namong interviewees. Their view contrasted with that of the IASC in arguing that this option should be\nthe rule rather than the exception. To address the risk that separate Coordinators entrench false\ndistinctions between relief and development in intellectual or operational terms, the UN will need clear\nstrategies to guide its action and strong collaboration among all those on the ground. Secondments\nfrom operational agencies to the post of Humanitarian Coordinator should be actively sought.\nvHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nSECTION 5: HOW COORDINATION GETS DONE\nSection 5 elaborates on the study’s recurring theme that effective coordination adds value to\nhumanitarian response by performing key tasks and offering a range of services and skills to\nhumanitarian agencies. The report sets out some of the ingredients that make such tasks, services\nand tools more or less helpful, as well as challenges associated with providing them.\n5.1 Coordinating Integrated Responses – Tasks and Techniques\nAnalysis: The fact that the IASC’s list of strategic coordination functions excludes analysis and that\ndonors show little interest in agencies’ understanding of their environment reinforces the notion that\nanalysis is an optional extra. Yet in the words of one interviewee, ‘Offering a compelling vision of what\ncan be achieved based on sound analysis of context is perhaps the greatest value added ever offered\nto coordination.’ Such analysis underpins effective strategies, including those to ensure that\nhumanitarian aid does more good than harm. Good contextual knowledge and situational analysis are\ncritical elements of effective security management. Analysis is also a vital part of learning lessons,\nwhich is currently weak. Both Coordinators and their team members require strong analytical skills.\nYet effective analysis also depends on techniques and systems to gather, share and manage\ninformation.\nFormulating a Strategy and Plan: Too often humanitarian actors are unable to articulate what they\nare trying to achieve, or how particular actions relate to precise goals. This impairs coordination and\nresponse. This study finds that strategies are most valuable when they are based on sound analysis\nand focus on tackling problems in an integrated way rather than in mandate sized pieces; when they\nfocus on providing both humanitarian protection and assistance, and include the principles and\nstandards that will inform that approach. They should also focus on specific, measurable targets and\nhave benchmarks against which progress can be monitored. At their best, strategies emerge from\nprocesses that allow participants opportunities for joint analysis and reflection, which includes NGOs\nand actors outside the UN. To get the most from joint planning requires harmonising planning tools\nand cycles.\nStandards: Given the absence or weakness of any government structure setting standards,\nhumanitarians are left to delineate their own guide for action. Without agreed standards, this may vary\nradically from one situation to another. Conducting humanitarian activity in a stable, predictable\nmanner is central to fostering respect for humanitarian principles and practice. Coordination teams\nhave central roles to play in facilitating principled responses. Yet at the field level the team found little\nevidence of attempts to standardise the response among agencies, beyond their expressed\ncommitment to the Sphere standards. While the study found examples where standards had been\nagreed, and even where compliance mechanisms had been established, overall the lack of system-\nwide agreement on what standards should be used and questions about who has sufficient power or\nlegitimacy to assess compliance predominate in most settings.\nAgreeing/Assigning Division of Labour and Allocating Resources: Coordinators can add value\nby orchestrating divisions of labour so that humanitarian response meets all the most urgent needs\nand not solely those that conform to agency mandates or mission statements. The division of labour is\ndone well where Coordinators have sufficient legitimacy such that agencies will accept greater\ndirection rather than suggestion, and agencies pool resources and allow the Coordinator to suggest\nmatching of resources and needs. To address the gaps and duplications that exist among UN\nmandates and the skills of NGOs, funds should be put in the hands of the Coordinators – whether\nsmall funds to cover gaps, or more radically by establishing a common fund at country-level to receive\nall responses to the CAP from which the Coordinator allocates funds to respective agencies.\nAdvocacy: This was an area of weakness, although a valued activity. Advocacy was often described\nas an end in itself rather than as a set of influencing tactics as critical to operational response as a\nwater tank or food parcel. The study found a number of examples where Coordinators and their teams\nhad played critical roles in coordinating advocacy actions, facilitating others, or acting as a\nspokesperson with warring parties, governments, donors and the media to push them to uphold their\nresponsibilities to respect humanitarian principles. These experiences highlighted that effective\nadvocacy requires sound analysis of the problem, clear messages and proposals for action, the ability\nto seize all available opportunities, and readiness to press the difficult issues.\nviHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nHowever, the study team was struck by the muteness of UN agencies towards donors – that is, an\napparent unwillingness by the UN to criticise donor government policies. This study argues that\nhumanitarian agencies, particularly the UN, must better manage the tension between relying on\ndonors for funds, complying with their Executive Boards, and pressing donors and governments to\nuphold rights to assistance and protection.\nNegotiating Access/Securing and Sustaining a Framework of Consent: Skilled and experienced\npeople that negotiate access for the benefit of the UN and NGOs are highly valued by the\nhumanitarian community. Clarity on principles and bottom lines among all those negotiating is also\nvaluable to prevent belligerents playing agencies off against each other. Securing agreement among\nUN agencies on who has principal responsibility for negotiating access is also important if training and\nresources are to be correctly targeted. Experience suggests that negotiation is done well where\nnegotiators have strong back up in terms of analysis and situation monitoring, and donors and\ngovernments provide additional leverage or undertake complementary diplomatic and political action.\nMonitoring Strategy: There were strikingly few examples of monitoring the progress and impact of\nstrategies from which to draw. Yet effective monitoring is essential in order to evaluate the positive\nand negative impact of humanitarian response, ensure that the response addresses changing\ncircumstances, and to assist with context analysis and lesson learning. Where coordination teams\nrecord such information, they can act as an institutional memory function. This is particularly important\nwhen staff turnover is high and has proved useful for subsequent evaluations of the response. This\nhighlights the value of resources being dedicated to the monitoring function.\n5.2 Facilitating Collaboration – Tasks and Services\nAs Coordinators have to build consensus in order to be effective, experience suggests coordination is\nimbued with a strong element of quid pro quo. Past experiences suggest there is a range of tasks and\nservices that Coordinators can provide to garner agencies' cooperation. These add value to individual\nagency responses, facilitate collaboration among agencies, and boost the profile of the coordination\nstructures that offer them.\nSecurity: Poorly coordinated security measures can corrode the trust and collaboration central to\ncoordination as well as place lives in jeopardy. In the face of Member States’ resistance to fund\nadditional security measures, UN agencies, who have been pushing for stronger centralised\nresources, have been forced to both provide funds and second staff to UNSECOORD. The IASC\nSecurity Working Group has also focused on measures to improve inter-agency collaboration on\nsecurity. This study’s evidence suggests that coordination teams should include dedicated capability\nto focus on security plans, assessments and advisories and efforts to devise common strategies. A\nneglected element of such strategies appears to be emphasis on the importance of building\nrelationships with local communities in order that they use whatever influence they have over armed\ngroups who might threaten humanitarian action and actors. It is essential that the UN is clear to non-\nUN agencies about what protection and evacuation arrangements the UN system can provide.\nLogistics coordination: Agencies or Coordinators that have been willing and able to put their\nservices and capabilities at the service of others have made a huge difference to agencies’ operations\nand been strongly appreciated. Agreed sets of procedures for joint logistics operations have also\nhelped collaboration and coordination. Efforts to create an inter-agency capacity to establish UN Joint\nLogistics Centres at the onset of a large-scale emergency is an important development in this regard.\nEvidence suggested that additional useful services include providing common communication\nfacilities, facilitating visas and laissez-passer, providing pigeonholes, meeting space, GIS/database\nand mapping services, NGO liaison, a front desk service, and guiding staff through induction services\nand training. Well-run meetings, as well as being the most obvious tool by which information is\ngathered and shared, are also useful for team building, problem solving and building networks.\nResource mobilisation: If decentralised funding decisions emerge as an enduring trend among\ndonors, the value attached to coordination teams involved in field-level resource mobilisation could\nincrease. On the basis of the evidence, resource mobilisation is done well where the Coordinator\ndoes not have responsibility for a particular agency’s operations and where efforts are prepared\njointly. The study argues that these efforts are likely to have greatest positive impact where they are\ndirected at system-wide responses, or even common funds.\nviiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nInformation: There is universal consensus that information sharing is the sine qua non of\ncoordination activity. The capacity to filter, analyse, synthesise and present information into digestible\nand easily used form is a valuable service. A common theme was the high value placed on\ninformation services that are provided in an equal way for the benefit of the entire humanitarian\ncommunity rather than solely for the UN or NGOs. The study outlines valued products and processes,\nincluding maps, graphs and matrixes of who is doing what where, directories of contacts, translation\nof local press, and the often neglected factor of access to archive material such as past assessments.\nCentral to improving information gathering and provision is being clear on what information is needed\nfor what purpose, and who has the responsibility for gathering it. Minimising the duplication in data\ngathering and maximising its accessibility to potential users is also crucial. (Sharing information is one\nof the foundations of coordination, but to gather information in the most efficient way requires\ncoordination.) Another key challenge is to solve the problem of how to gather and disseminate\npolitically sensitive information and analysis. All this highlights the importance of having sufficient staff\nwho have specific information management skills. Agreeing guidelines for basic data collection and\ndissemination is an important element in making coordination more consistently effective.\n5.3 Tools and Structures\nHumanitarian Coordinators and their teams also have a number of tools and structures that they can\nutilise or with which they interact. Tools include the CAP and MoUs, while structures include\ncoordination at sectoral and regional levels as well as the IASC.\nThe CAP: For most interviewees, despite the continuous efforts to improve the CAP, there is little\nuniformity in how it is done, what or whom it includes, and how it is used. For many it remains a\nfunding-focused public relations exercise with little integrated planning or prioritisation that leaves the\ndonors to cherry pick or even ignore it. Although globally the CAP provides one of the only tools that\nenables comparison of international responses to humanitarian need, at its worst preparing the CAP\nis more oriented to estimating likely donor response than a reliable assessment of humanitarian need.\nHowever, donors continue to express enthusiasm for the CAP and to find it useful in various ways.\nAlthough it is far from producing system-wide integrated strategies and plans, by bringing people\ntogether the CAP has the potential to be an important opportunity to do this if effectively facilitated,\nsupported and ‘marketed’ to agencies. This could underpin programming, security, impact\nassessment and inter-agency advocacy. As an effective funding tool, it is necessary for Coordinators\nto be given greater authority to facilitate and ultimately perform prioritisation.\nSectoral coordination: Although sectoral coordination it is likely to be made easier by a shared focus\namong all participants, the study revealed it is not immune to the difficulties encountered in\ncoordination in general. It can impose burdens that outweigh its benefits when the number of\ncoordination bodies proliferates. Allocating responsibility can also prove contentious, particularly when\nno agency has clear technical expertise or mandated responsibility. Both donors and agencies can\nresist the Coordinator’s efforts to address this, suggesting that there needs to be more work at the\ncentral level to build in predictability on allocating responsibilities.\nExperience suggests that sectoral coordination works well where sectoral level strategies are linked to\nfulfilling the overall response strategy, and if full-time Coordinators are appointed at the sectoral level\nthat are technically competent and are prepared to ‘shame and blame‘ others into upholding their\nundertakings. Field units that collect and disseminate information, advise on strategies, and act as\nfocal points for debate have also been useful. It is also important that sectoral coordination does not\npreclude focus on cross-cutting issues such as human rights or protection.\nRegional coordination: As one UN interviewee commented ‘It is critical for the UN to get better at\nthis given that the problems we address do not stay within borders.’ Regional structures have, on\noccasion, compensated for weak support from headquarters and have offered invaluable logistics or\nadministrative support; on other occasions these structures have duplicated efforts. Many argued that\nregional coordination can be best achieved by country coordination structures establishing a flow of\ninformation and analysis between them. Interviewees' key complaint concerned confusion about how\nCoordinators and structures at the regional level relate to those at country-level. Clarity about\nrespective roles and responsibilities, ensuring that these are complementary rather than duplicating,\nstrong collaboration among Coordinators, and the provision of resources to enable coordination\nteams within a region to come together are all recommended if regional coordination is to be valuable.\nviiiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nMoUs counter the tendency to leave UN Country Teams to negotiate continually new relationships at\nfield level, although there is debate about the precise level of detail that is helpful. Broad frameworks\nwhere specific interpretation of language can be interpreted in a particular context are most useful.\nFor others, this left too much to interpretation.\nThe IASC is the mechanism through which field structures are put in place. Although participants cite\nimprovements in the IASC over time, frustrations remain. Its broad membership is seen as its most\nimportant feature. As a focus for regular inter-agency interaction, it has fostered collaborative spirit.\nYet within the IASC there is a preoccupation with inclusion. Furthermore, in a body that relies on\nconsensus, decision-making is protracted and difficult issues get dodged. This is partly because all\nparticipants report to different boards, which causes weak buy-in and accountability. But it is not\nhelped by having overloaded meeting agendas. As a result, much substantive work gets done in the\ncorridors.\nAll of this has a direct bearing on decision-making over decisions about field coordination structures.\nMuch of this debate appears to take place outside the IASC meetings and thus minimises the role of\nnon-UN members. Furthermore, the process appears heavily oriented to accommodating the\npreferences and politics of the major UN operational agencies rather than solely focusing on the\ndemands of the situation on the ground.\nThe weak links between staff in the field and those in headquarters also impinge on the IASC’s\ndecision-making and effectiveness. Doubts were expressed about the IASC’s responsiveness to field-\nlevel coordination difficulties. Conversely, although Humanitarian Coordinators may be invited to\nattend the IASC when their countries are being discussed, in the field there appears to be little\ninterest in the IASC. However, studies and interviewees alike perceived the potential of the IASC. The\nwords of one UN interviewee sum this up well: ‘OCHA has in its hand a fantastic tool. Why doesn’t it\nuse it? Why not try to make it the voice of the humanitarian community?’\nThus for this study, the key areas for improvement are:\n• More focus on the situation’s demands in decision-making over the appointments of Coordinators.\n• Better monitoring of coordination structures in the field.\n• The instigation of more systematic consultation and communication processes through\ncoordination teams on the ground.\n• Strengthening IASC-wide advocacy.\n5.4 Conclusion\nIt is notable that some of the tasks that are most valued are among the weakest aspects of current\ncoordination. These are also the tasks that have proved critical to facilitating integrated responses to\nhumanitarian need  - such as analysis, strategy setting, establishing standards, divisions of labour,\nadvocacy and negotiating access, and monitoring impact.\nA repeated theme of this study is that the UN can improve coordination by devoting more energy to\nbuilding skills and capacity to coordinate response in a more systematic and accountable way. Thus\nthe tasks and services above should be part of a standard coordination package on offer to increase\nthe impact of response. As complex emergencies by their definition preclude a one-size-fits-all policy,\nsuch packages should be a menu of possible options and arrangements on which the IASC should\ndecide in accordance with the demands of the particular context and emergency.\nSECTION 6: LIAISING WITH MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACTORS\nThe study's ToR asked whether in different settings the relationship between humanitarian, political\nand military actors is coherent. The term coherence is variously used: its mildest interpretation argues\nfor political, military and humanitarian action to be mutually reinforcing, its strongest that\nhumanitarians should be subject to political goals. What emerged from this study was the tension\nbetween the emphasis on the strong interpretation from key players in the Secretariat, and the\npowerful examples from case studies of the importance for humanitarians to resist this; to guard their\nindependence not as end in itself but as the cornerstone of practical strategies to attempt to sustain a\nframework of consent from belligerents. This was likely to involve demonstrating separation from\npolitical and military players on the ground.\nixHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nAs the Secretary-General’s views have appeared to shift on whether humanitarian assistance should\nbe insulated from, or integrated into, broader political frameworks, it is perhaps not surprising that\nsome SRSGs have been accused of having interpreted coherence as a justification for them to gain\npolitical mileage from control of humanitarian assets. Yet this perverts the very definition of\nhumanitarian action that seeks to confer no military or political advantage. It also threatens security:\nAs one interviewee remarked, 'Wherever we are associated with political strategies, we increase our\nown risk.' This highlights the risks of misguided enthusiasm for designating Resident/Humanitarian\nCoordinators as deputy to the SRSG.\nSeparation is not always necessary. The nature of the political and military strategies and how\nbeneficiaries and belligerents see them is a key determinant for how humanitarians position\nthemselves. Thus silence about the nature of the strategic goals for such coherent strategies is also\npart of the problem. In the wake of the Brahimi report, there is renewed pressure for all aspects of UN\nstrategies to converge around peacebuilding, which is seen as unproblematic. Yet it should not be\nassumed that peacebuilding is inherently apolitical. It may mask unarticulated agendas and creates\nthe possibility that humanitarian aid is simply coopted to meet political ends.\nThe coherence sought or required of UN humanitarians has a major significance for their relationship\nwith other humanitarian actors, who are ready to distance themselves from the UN. Key players in the\nUN Secretariat are dismissive of any dilemma, arguing that UN agencies have different\nresponsibilities from NGOs. However, the humanitarian label links all those who use it, and such\ncoherence could have operational impacts beyond the UN humanitarian agencies.\nThis highlights the need for greater clarity from all sides on the respective roles of all players in order\nto be able to establish a clear division of labour and to delimit responsibilities among political, military\nand humanitarian actors. Advocacy, clear and limited points of contact to enable information flow, and\nclear locations and frameworks for planning multifaceted strategies are essential.\nSECTION 7: OCHA'S ROLE\nOCHA’s invidious position of having a mandate for coordination that is undermined by a lack of\nauthority and clout, resistance from UN agencies, and uncertain funding is a prime example of the\nstructural obstacles to UN coordination.\nYet OCHA also undermines its frail credibility by fluctuating performance. Although providing dynamic,\nhighly competent people to serve humanitarians has been at the heart of OCHA's success to date, all\ntoo many staff are slow to be deployed, given uncertain or no contracts, and poorly briefed. Staff\nturnover is high - a crippling failure for an organisation that depends on the calibre of its people. While\nthe team were struck how UN agencies repeatedly seek to minimise OCHA's profile, OCHA also\njeopardises success when it fails to consult or engage others effectively, or to give the impression that\nits interest in service is merely rhetorical device rather than an organisational commitment.\nSetting aside the possibility of fundamental structural change, the study focuses on how OCHA can\nbuild its legitimacy and gain support by providing high quality coordination services. The study argues\nthat OCHA should develop itself as a centre of excellence for coordination support functions at\nregional, country and sectoral levels. This depends on OCHA retaining and recruiting dynamic, highly\ncompetent and experienced people at the service of the humanitarian community. Thus OCHA should\nearn its profile by the reputation of its services for other humanitarians, and thus its impact on\nhumanitarian response, rather than for its own sake. The study also concludes that excellence in\naccess negotiations, political analysis and advocacy have been features of past successes and\nshould be among OCHA's core strengths.\nOCHA concedes that is has not yet fulfilled it potential advocacy role. This is particularly the case at\nheadquarters. OCHA has a unique position as the humanitarian voice within the Secretariat. Its\nchallenge is to both leverage its proximity to the Secretary-General’s office to give it weight, while\ncontinually engaging in robust advocacy targeted at those within the Secretariat. The fact that key\nplayers in the Secretariat remain unclear about the dangers posed to humanitarian access and action\nby the requirements of 'coherence' signals the urgency for the ERC and OCHA to strategise with its\nsister UN agencies and other humanitarians about how to push this advocacy agenda. But evidence\nsuggests that OCHA will have to work harder to convince others that it can be an effective\nhumanitarian voice in the face of the political pressures that converge in the Secretariat.\nxHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nWhile the onus is in part on OCHA to perform and persuade, the study team maintain that there must\nbe pressure on agencies to respect OCHA's mandate from the Secretary-General and donors.\nSECTION 8: CONCLUSIONS\n8.1 The Obstacles to Change\nOne of the underlying themes in this study as it presents the conclusions from past studies, interviews\nand case studies is that there is little new to say. The report sets out in some detail the picture that\nrecurs over a decade of UN humanitarian agencies whose governance structures, funding sources,\nweak management and institutional cultures all constitute obstacles to effective coordination. It has\nalso described the blight of adhocracy that remains in how the UN system coordinates. The repeated\nrefrains of reviews and studies suggest that a pivotal problem confronting the system its inability to\nchange. This is the result of resistance on the part of Member States and donors, and weaknesses\ninternal to the system.\nThe evidence also reveals a ‘system’ that shows determined resistance to cede authority to anyone or\nany structure. Instead, all Coordinators have to work on the basis of coordination by consensus. In the\nface of the obstacles, this is an uphill struggle.\nTo eradicate some of these obstacles requires fundamental change. Yet despite the manifold\nobstacles to coordination, remarkably, humanitarian coordination does happen, although performance\nremains patchy. This study concludes that there is much that UN agencies can do to maximise the\nlikelihood that humanitarian response is effectively coordinated, despite the structural obstacles and\nthat it is incumbent upon them to do so.\nThis responsibility derives from the expectations of governments and humanitarian agencies of the\nUN’s central and unique role to coordinate the humanitarian efforts of the international community.\nYet this study has shown that there are others, in particular donors, who will fill the vacuum left by a\nUN system that fails to deliver in this coordinating role.\n8.2 Options for Change\nGiven these conclusions, the options for improving coordination range from fundamental change to\nremove obstacles, to more incremental ones to increase the incentives to coordinate. It is important to\nreiterate that none of the options for change or recommendations are entirely new. Many of them\necho recommendations of studies of coordination over more than a decade. This suggests that the\nproblem is not a dearth of recommendations about how to improve coordination, but lack of both\nmanagement accountability for successes or failures and sufficient commitment to improving\nhumanitarian response.\n1. Fundamental structural reform of the UN's humanitarian operations\nGiven the accumulated evidence that consensus models are not strong enough to achieve\neffective coordination in the face of chronic systemic obstacles, the study believes that there is a\nstrong case to be made for structural reform. Notwithstanding the recent debate around UN\nreform, the scale of the problem suggests this debate must be reopened if there is genuine\ncommitment to strengthening the humanitarian response of the UN.\nThe limited scope of this study prohibits systematic consideration of detailed recommendations.\nBut it is clear that the challenge is to construct a body or structure with sufficient authority to be\nable to manage and guide humanitarian action – whether directly through a management line of\none single humanitarian agency, or through a sufficiently powerful new structure that stands\nabove existing funds and programmes to ensure prioritised and integrated responses. Such a\nstructure should link with political actors to devise the political strategies necessary to address the\ncauses of conflict and human suffering, as well as with development actors to ensure effective\ncoordination between relief and development activity. Such a structure would also need to retain\nthe elements currently fulfilled by diverse mandates; it should be both more efficient and\nresponsive; and it should be able to relate effectively to humanitarian actors outside the UN.\nxiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nIn a world of conglomerating NGOs who are increasingly favoured by donors, and where there is\ngreater momentum to integrate UN humanitarian operations into broader peacebuilding\napproaches, there are some who advocate that the debate should ask yet more fundamental\nquestions about the comparative advantage of the UN. They raise questions about whether,\ninstead of current levels of operational response, the UN should focus on 'core business' such as\ncoordination, setting standards, upholding protection for refugees and IDPs, monitoring, and\nnegotiating access.\n2. Change the funding for humanitarian coordination and increase Coordinators' authority on\nthe ground\nIn the interests of more systematic and effective coordination, and to avoid those with\ncoordination responsibilities from competing with others, OCHA should be funded from assessed\ncontributions. At field level, in place of funding particular agencies in response to the Consolidated\nAppeal, donors should contribute funds to a common fund in the hands of the Coordinator who\nshould be vested with authority to prioritise and allocate funds to the strategy formulated by\nhumanitarian agencies in the field.\n3. Strengthening the Current Decentralised System\nAt the heart of change is the need for improved management, stronger accountability, and more\nsystematic approaches to coordination.\nThe current reliance on Coordinators and their teams having to persuade others to coordinate\nmust be buttressed by greater sanction attached to failing to coordinate. The commitment to\ncoordination should be fostered by requiring all staff to focus on the system-wide response to\nbeneficiaries’ needs rather than solely on their agency’s interests. At a minimum, all agencies\nmust expect and instil greater discipline through conventional management lines so that\npersonnel are assessed and rewarded on the basis of their participation and contribution to inter-\nagency coordination and coordinated outcomes.\nAll coordination structures and personnel should have clear guidance, reporting lines and defined\nrelationships with all other key players. There needs to be greater efforts from the system to\nmonitor coordination and to be quicker to resolve difficulties where they occur. Such difficulties\nshould be the subject of evaluation and subsequent lessons to be learnt.\nTo maximise the ability of coordination teams to persuade others to coordinate, greater financial\nand management resources should be directed at the provision of coordination services and tools\nthat clearly ‘add value’ to individual agency operations. This also requires greater leadership by\nhigh-calibre, experienced staff. OCHA has an important role to play in this.\n8.3 The Pivotal Role of UN Member States and Donors\nEffecting any of these options requires action from several quarters. To reiterate: any change –\nwhether that of enduring systemic change or maximising the effectiveness of the current\nsystem – requires changes in the behaviour of Member States and donors.\nOverall, if Member States and donors want better humanitarian coordination, they must be prepared\nto fund coordination costs and to place their expectations only where mandated responsibilities lie.\nFunding coordination from assessed contributions is a vital part of this, as is establishing a fund for\nthe ERC to pay Humanitarian Coordinators.\nAmong the measures to maximise the effect of the current system, donors should support the\ndevelopment and agreement of indicators to assess coordination and its impact as well as the\ncontribution of agencies to it as a criterion for funding. Performance appraisal systems that assess\nstaff on the basis of their commitment to coordination in addition to the willingness of agencies to\nsecond competent staff could be among these indicators. Donors should apply greater pressure to\nUN humanitarian agencies and NGOs to support and respect the role of OCHA, as well as strengthen\nOCHA to work for the benefit of the humanitarian response rather than its own agency profile. Donors\ncan strengthen their coordination within and among themselves and demonstrate more consistent\nsupport to coordination through their funding and their presence on the legislative bodies of\norganisations (whether the UNSC, UNGA, or Executive Boards).\nxiiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nAs well as increasing levels of humanitarian aid to ensure impartial response to all those in need,\ndonors should provide increased resources for efforts aimed at strengthening coordination such as\nmonitoring, appraisal, assessment and shared training. Donors should also contribute to common\nfunds, whether small additional funds for Humanitarian Coordinators to fill gaps in the response or,\nmore radically, a fund to receive all contributions to the CAP. Both measures should be accompanied\nby donor support for the Coordinator to undertake prioritisation in place of donor earmarking.\n8.4 The Role of the Secretary-General\nThe Secretary-General has a vital role in strengthening commitment to coordination and coordinated\noutcomes. He can lend the full weight of his authority to the ERC and insist that agencies recognise\nthis. He can push for greater system-wide orientation. He can also encourage the heads of the\noperational agencies to second staff and establish rosters of those available, urge them to support the\ncreation of common funds for management by the Coordinator – whether for filling gaps in response,\nor more radically, to receive all funds for the CAP – and require that they strengthen the requirement\nof their staff to contribute to coordinated outcomes by including this in performance appraisals.\nThe Secretary-General also has a critical role to play in reducing the adhocracy that currently blights\ncoordination, for instance by ensuring the implementation of the Brahimi report’s recommendations\nthat SRSGs, Force Commanders, Resident Coordinators and Humanitarian Coordinators all have\nclear guidance, reporting lines and relationships with all other key players. (The reservations\nregarding other aspects of the report have been outlined above.)\nFinally, the Secretary-General has important responsibilities to advocate that humanitarian action\nretains its independence from political and military strategies of the UN and Member States. For this\nto be effective, it requires clear points of contact and information exchange between political or\nhumanitarian players. The Secretary-General must quash resistance to this in the Department of\nPolitical Affairs (DPA) and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO).\n8.5 Consolidated Recommendations to the ERC, OCHA and the IASC\nThe following recommendations combine those elaborated in the text with additional\nrecommendations based on the study’s conclusions. These are among the measures that should be\nwell within the grasp of a UN system serious about the effective coordination of action to protect the\nrights of human beings to protection and assistance.\nRecommendations to the ERC and OCHA\nOCHA’s Change Management Report presents a raft of recommendations to address some of\nOCHA's weaknesses. This report recommends the following priorities:\n1. OCHA, in close discussion with IASC members, should draw together the lessons from this study\nas well as its current proposals for field coordination into a package of coordination services and\ntools, along with the prototype office structures and staff competencies associated with providing\nthem. This can then be used as a menu of options on offer for all Coordinators. This should be\npresented to the IASC for agreement with an associated action plan, including a training\nprogramme, to ensure that OCHA can provide quality coordination services.\n2. The ERC has a vital role to play in proactive monitoring of the conduct of coordination, particularly\nat the start of new emergencies, and reporting back to the IASC and to the Secretary-General.\nThe ERC may need an enhanced monitoring and evaluation capacity that reports directly to\nhim/her, using inter alia, indicators as recommended in A3 below.\n3. OCHA should further strengthen the CAP as an inter-agency analysis and strategy-setting\nprocess, including working with UN Country Teams to provide analysis tools and facilitation for\nthe process. The involvement in the analytical process of NGOs, the Red Cross Movement and\nUN political and military actors and analysts should be actively sought.\n4. The ERC has a vital role to play in robust advocacy – both within the Secretariat and with UN\nMember States – on the principles, role and limits of humanitarian action, and the political action\nrequired to uphold the right to humanitarian assistance and protection. ECHA and ECPS are\nimportant fora for advocacy on the nature, challenges and limits to humanitarian action; the ERC\ncan also press for action in the political, diplomatic and peacekeeping sphere. It will be important\nto strategise with other humanitarians about how to push this advocacy agenda. The IASC –\ngiven its broad membership – is the obvious forum for such strategising.\nxiiiHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nRecommendations to the Inter-Agency Standing Committee\nIt is recommended that the IASC review the findings of this study and formulate an action plan for\nfollow up. Among the measures that should be included are the following:\nA. Appraisal\n1. The UN members of the IASC should review and revise existing performance appraisal schemes\nfor all staff. These should include criteria to measure demonstrated contribution to inter-agency\ncoordination and coordinated outcomes. Particular incentives should be attached to secondments\nto inter-agency efforts.\n2. The UN members of the IASC should establish an inter-agency working group to compare and\nharmonise performance appraisal schemes and the rewards and sanctions associated with\ncontributing to coordination or thwarting it.\n3. The IASC should agree performance appraisal criteria and a regular appraisal process for\nHumanitarian Coordinators. This should include indicators for behaviour or action that would\ntrigger a process of review leading to removal from the position.\n4. The IASC should work with donors to identify indicators of coordination and coordinated\noutcomes as the basis for funding decisions. Performance appraisal systems that assess staff on\nthe basis of their commitment to coordination, and the willingness of agencies to second\ncompetent staff, should be among these indicators.\nB. Recruitment of Coordination Staff\n1. The IASC should intensify its efforts to work with the UNDG and OCHA to agree the\ncompetencies and selection processes for Resident and Humanitarian Coordinators. This should\ninclude agreement of where skills for Humanitarian Coordinators might differ from or clash with\nthose expected of Resident Coordinators.\n2. All IASC member agencies should intensify efforts to establish an inter-agency roster of\ncoordination staff that indicates staff skills and availability. They should do this by undertaking a\nthorough process of identifying individuals with aptitude for coordination positions – whether as\nHumanitarian Coordinators or support staff – including those with potential but who may require\ntraining.\n3. The IASC should explore with non-UN members the potential for extended secondments of NGO\npersonnel as Coordinators and support staff. This would require the agreement of potential\ntraining needs necessary for non-UN staff to work for the UN.\nC. Induction Processes\n1. The IASC should form an inter-agency working group on induction processes to compare current\nguidance and information provided to new staff. On the basis of this review, this group should\ndevelop a series of training materials and processes for generic guidance to help staff anticipate\nand overcome challenges. This would be provided to all staff going to the field, or as refresher\ncourses for existing staff. Such materials should include information on mandates, activities and\ncompetencies of all IASC members, humanitarian principles, Sphere standards, impact indicators,\nand security, as agreed by the IASC. This could form a common UN humanitarian handbook.\n2. The IASC should agree that one of the aspects of the coordination package provided by OCHA\nshould include providing induction guidance tailored to the specific context to offer as a service to\nincoming staff of all humanitarian agencies. This could also have an additional benefit of\nencouraging staff to deepen their understanding and their political, economic and social analysis\nthat is essential to effective humanitarian response.\n3. All IASC members should commit to making handovers between staff more systematic by\nincluding them in all job descriptions as a requirement of all departing staff. At headquarters,\nmanagement should be improved to increase the number of handovers that take place.\nD. Monitoring\n1. The IASC should agree a process to evaluate field coordination at regular intervals in order to\nincrease both its responsiveness and ability to resolve problems. This could include a) regular\nreporting against agreed benchmarks to the IASC by IASC members in the field, and b) a process\nof small inter-agency teams travelling to the field to carry out agreed systematic assessments\nbefore reporting back to the IASC.\nxivHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n2. An assessment of the contribution of agencies to coordination and coordinated outcomes should\nbe part of the process of the mid-term CAP review. This could include agency self-assessment\nagainst agreed criteria, potentially backed up by independent evaluation.\nE. Reporting Lines and Accountability\n1. The IASC should agree the relationship, reporting lines and accountability of all those involved in\ncoordination, in particular between the head of the OCHA field coordination unit and the\nHumanitarian Coordinator.\n2. The IASC should agree who will deputise for the Humanitarian Coordinator in all instances,\nincluding a protocol for further contingency arrangements should it be necessary to further\ndeputise for the deputy. This should exclude those with responsibilities for operational\nprogrammes where there are alternatives. This makes a strong case for the head of OCHA offices\nbeing appointed as the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator.\nF. Country and Regional Structures\n1. IASC members should agree to replicate the IASC at the field level in all instances.\n2. IASC members should adopt the same designations of what constitutes a region as a first step to\nfacilitate regional coordination, and should work towards having any regional structures co-\nlocated with those of other agencies.\n3. IASC members should instigate more systematic consultation and communication with\ncoordination teams in the field.\nG. Advocacy\n1. The IASC should form an advocacy working group to agree a broad framework for advocacy\nstrategies towards UN Member States, donors, belligerent groups, and other parts of the UN\nincluding DPA, DPKO and the Office of the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General,\nat headquarters, country and local level. This would include responsibilities for the ERC and IASC\nmembers at headquarters and in the field. It is vital that UN agencies continue robust advocacy\nwith donors on their obligations to respect the humanitarian principles of universality and\nimpartiality.\n2. All IASC members should collaborate with OCHA in pressing UN Member States to fund\ncoordination – both OCHA and Humanitarian Coordinators – from assessed contributions.\nH. Systemisation\n1. The IASC should agree a package of coordination services and likely accompanying structures to\nbe prepared by OCHA as the basis for coordination structures in country as standard operating\nprocedure for OCHA. This should include agreement on the potential value of OCHA having a\npresence in the field at sub-office level to provide effective coordination support.\n2. The IASC should make clear specifications on these coordination structures, the required\ncompetencies and the reporting relationships as part of all decisions on coordination options\nconsidered by the UN and the rest of the IASC.\n3. The IASC should agree a matrix of MoUs to be negotiated to complement existing MoUs.\nI. On the CAP, all IASC members should work with OCHA to:\n1. Strengthen the CAP as a valuable opportunity for inter-agency analysis and strategy setting,\nincluding both operational response and advocacy strategies.\n2. Require Coordinators to actively seek the involvement of NGOs and the Red Cross Movement in\nthe analysis process, if not the fundraising strategy.\n3. Improve the accuracy and transparency of the CAP’s assessment of target beneficiaries to\nincrease its use as an advocacy tool. This will help in assessing and comparing international\nresponses to humanitarian need.\n4. Give a stronger remit to Coordinators to facilitate prioritised, integrated strategies to respond to\nhumanitarian need.\n5. Under effective and accountable Coordinators in an improved system of coordination, donors\nshould be required to place their responses to Consolidated Appeals in a single country fund –\nrather than funding individual agency activities – in the hands of a Coordinator.\nxvHumanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n1: INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background\nIn September 2000, the Policy Development Unit of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs (OCHA) commissioned the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to undertake a study on\nhumanitarian coordination in order to sharpen thinking on UN humanitarian coordination in the light of\na number of inter-related processes underway in the UN. These include:\n• The continuing debate on the criteria to be applied in selecting one or other of the three ‘models’ of\nhumanitarian coordination – the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator or so-called ‘combined\nmodel’, the model where the Humanitarian Coordinator is separate from the Resident Coordinator,\nand the ‘lead agency model’. (The request made in mid-2000 to the Secretary-General by the then\nPermanent Representative of the US to the UN to employ the lead agency model more often\nreinvigorated the debate.)\n7\n• The report of the UN Panel on Peace Operations, referred to as the Brahimi report.\n• OCHA’s Change Management process instigated to strengthen OCHA’s ability to deliver on its\nmandate.\n• Work within the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and the UN Secretariat to clarify\nrelationships and responsibilities on internally displaced people (IDPs), disarmament,\ndemobilisation and reintegration (DDR), and between Special Representatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral (SRSGs), Humanitarian Coordinators and Resident Coordinators.\n1.2 Objectives and Scope of the Study\nThe terms of reference (ToR) state that the purpose of the study is to assist the Emergency Relief\nCoordinator (ERC) and the IASC ‘to draw lessons from recent experiences in humanitarian\ncoordination, with a view to better understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each\ncoordination model in particular circumstances, leading to a clearer definition of criteria for choosing\nthe most appropriate coordination arrangements in any given situation’ (see Annexe 1).\nThe study is also required to identify ‘features of coordination arrangements which were seen, by\nthose involved, to have provided “added value”, as well as those which were felt not to have\ncontributed to the effective coordination of the overall humanitarian operation.’\nThe terms further specified the need for the study to consider the following questions:\n• Is the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) perceived as an aid to effective coordination?\n• Is the relationship between humanitarian, development and political/military actors seen to be\ncoherent and mutually reinforcing?\n• Is access a problem? If so, do humanitarian actors believe that current coordination arrangements\nensure that the problem is being addressed as effectively as possible?\n• Do all the actors feel that they have the information they need to coordinate their operations\neffectively with each other? How do they believe that information sharing and information\nmanagement could be improved?\n•\n Is sectoral coordination perceived to be working well?\n• Has there been any attempt to introduce strategic monitoring of the humanitarian programme?\n• Is the coordination model in place perceived to be appropriate by humanitarian actors?\nThe study team interpreted this as a task to:\ni identify what worked where, when, why and how, in order to\nii identify the lessons for selecting humanitarian coordination arrangements in the future, based\non reflections and analysis of different settings and experience.\n                                                          \n7\n Brahimi, L. (2000) Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations A/55/305 S/2000/809 (United Nations: New York)\nAugust.\n1Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nA number of interviewees were concerned that the study’s ToR neglected consideration of\nhumanitarian coordination in natural disasters. Some challenged the rationale offered in the ToR that\n‘coordination arrangements in countries afflicted by natural disasters are well established…and not\nseen to be in need of review’. Others added that excluding natural disasters from the focus\nperpetuated the division that has occurred, not least within OCHA, between those working in and on\nnatural disasters as opposed to complex emergencies.\nThe study’s focus was the UN and coordination of, and by, the humanitarian agencies of the UN\nsystem. Yet UN agencies do not work in a vacuum but interact with host governments and authorities,\nlocal and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the Red Cross Movement,\ngovernments, donor agencies and the military. In many settings, NGOs and the Red Cross Movement\nare major implementers of humanitarian response on the ground, with international NGOs (INGOs)\nsometimes acting as implementing partners of UN agencies. The experiences of all these actors –\nwhether as coordinators or those being coordinated – were included in the study.\n1.3 Methodology\nThis is an independent study. It was carried out by a Research Fellow and Research Associate of the\nODI in London. The findings are based on three sets of sources:\ni A review of literature on humanitarian coordination. This focused on studies of humanitarian\ncoordination arrangements and experiences in specific country settings across the world over\nthe last 10 years, as well as relevant UN documents (see attached bibliography).\nii Interviews with more than 250 people including past and present Humanitarian Coordinators,\nstaff of UN agencies, staff in the UN Secretariat, donor governments, other UN Member\nStates, the Red Cross movement, NGOs, and the military (see attached list of interviewees).\niii Three case studies to examine in greater detail ongoing humanitarian operations. The case\nstudies were the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somalia and Kosovo. They were\nselected on the basis that they offered different coordination models in different continental\nsettings at different stages of crisis and posed different challenges. The case studies each\ninvolved a week-long field trip to interview UN agencies, NGOs, agencies from the Red Cross\nMovement, donors and local authorities (see Annexes).\nThere were three major constraints encountered by the study team:\ni It was a challenge to address the broad scope of the study and do justice to the wealth of\nmaterial gathered in the time available. The literature review was conducted at speed. The\nthree field trips provided fascinating snapshots of the challenges of different country contexts\nbut precluded detailed analysis of coordination over time. A case study on East Timor was\nenvisaged but proved impossible. The literature review, along with the case studies and\ninterviews, generated a huge amount of source material.\nii The absence of any consistently used indicators to assess what constitutes successful\ncoordination. This study has relied on interviewees’ perceptions and past studies’ conclusions\n \nof what has made a difference to humanitarian response. Agreeing indicators for coordination\nis an area that requires further study. This is essential if coordination is to be better monitored\nand evaluated.\niii A number of staff members of both OCHA in Geneva and UN agencies expressed concern\nthat they had not been consulted on the study and its ToR prior to the study team being\ncontracted and/or embarking on the work in October 2000. As a result they were unclear\nabout OCHA’s intentions in commissioning the study and expressed disquiet that they were\nexpected to cooperate with a study about which they had not been effectively consulted. As a\nresult the study was delayed while OCHA consulted with five focal points in UNHCR,\nUNICEF, WFP, UNDP and DPA and revised the ToR. The team commenced work again on\n13 November 2000. In spite of this difficult beginning, the team was grateful that all IASC\nmembers collaborated fully in the study.\n2Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n1.4 Structure\nIn Section 2, the report sets the context.

The Office of the UN Disaster Relief Coordinator (UNDRO) was created ‘to\nmobilise, direct and coordinate relief’ in response to requests from countries with people requiring\nrelief assistance.\nDuring the 1980s as the UN found itself obliged to offer humanitarian assistance in situations of\ninternal armed conflict, a ‘lead agency’ was sometimes appointed from among the principal\nhumanitarian agencies. In other situations special ad hoc coordination bodies were established, such\nas the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa (OEOA) set up in 1984 to coordinate responses for\ncrisis in the Horn of Africa, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian and Economic\nAssistance Programmes Relating to Afghanistan (UNOCA) established in 1988.\nIn December 1991, after 17 General Assembly resolutions and decisions seeking to strengthen\n8\ndisaster response, a raft of criticisms of UNDRO’s record, a growing concern that ad hoc\narrangements for humanitarian coordination were unsatisfactory, and the Gulf war, the General\nAssembly passed another resolution with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nUN’s humanitarian operations in the field, General Assembly Resolution 46/182.\nMany of the features of resolution 46/182 echoed those of Resolution 2816. Resolution 46/182\ncreated the post of the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and the IASC. It also proposed a central\nfunding mechanism – the Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF) – under the authority of the\nSecretary-General. This would hold $50m of voluntary contributions to be replenished by responses\nto a Consolidated Appeal in order to ensure adequate resources in the initial phase of a humanitarian\nresponse. The resolution also proposed that the UN should build up a central register of all\nspecialised personnel. But in other ways Resolution 46/182 was a backward step, for instance, in\n9\ndropping the reference to ‘direction’ in the earlier resolution.\nIn 1992, the Secretary-General established the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), with the\nERC also serving as Under-Secretary-General (USG) for Humanitarian Affairs. Then in 1994 the IASC\napproved the ToR for Humanitarian Coordinators who would, upon the occurrence of a complex\nemergency in a country, be appointed by the ERC on behalf of the Secretary-General to be the senior\nUN official on the ground in charge of coordinating international humanitarian assistance. It was\nagreed that the UN Resident Coordinator serving in the affected country would ‘normally’ become the\nHumanitarian Coordinator. However, two other possibilities were also foreseen: that a Humanitarian\nCoordinator might be appointed separately from the Resident Coordinator (or in a situation in which\nthere was no Resident Coordinator), or that a ‘lead agency’ might be designated, whose local country\ndirector would exercise the functions of Humanitarian Coordinator.\nIn 1997, the IASC reviewed the various coordination mechanisms and reaffirmed that the current\nResident Coordinator should be confirmed as Humanitarian Coordinator if s/he has the necessary\nprofile. Otherwise there should be an immediate replacement to fulfil the combined function. Only in\nexceptional cases where the ERC and IASC determined that the one person could not carry out the\ntwo functions should a separate Humanitarian Coordinator be appointed. The IASC affirmed that the\nHumanitarian Coordinator is accountable to the ERC and should not have operational responsibilities.\nIndeed the ERC and DHA were urged to divest themselves of operational tasks (for example,\ndemining, demobilisation, natural disaster mitigation, logistics and transport).\n                                                          \n8\n For insights into UNDRO’s record, see Righter, R. (1995) Utopia Lost: The United Nations and World Order. (Brookings\nInstitution Press: Washington DC).\n9\n Also, whereas Resolution 2816 had called for the Secretary-General to appoint a disaster relief coordinator at USG level to\nreport directly to him, 46/182 called for the appointment of a high-level relief official to be appointed as ERC with ‘direct access’\nto the Secretary-General. (However, in the event, the ERC was appointed at the USG level.) See Ingram, J. (1993) ‘The Future\nArchitecture for International Humanitarian Assistance’ in Weiss, T. & Minear, L. (eds) Humanitarianism Across Borders –\nSustaining Civilians in Times of War (Lynne Rienner Publishers: Boulder).\n4Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nAs part of the Secretary-General’s reform programme of 1997, OCHA replaced DHA. OCHA had a\nstreamlined mandate, and was divested of responsibility for DHA’s operational activities. Its core\nfunctions are coordination of humanitarian response to complex emergencies and disasters – by\nensuring, through the IASC, that the appropriate mechanisms are on the ground – advocacy, and\npolicy development in support of the Secretary-General and the IASC.\nToday, the combined Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator model exists in 15 countries, the lead\nagency model in two countries, and the Humanitarian Coordinator separate from the Resident\n10\nCoordinator in four countries. OCHA field coordination units, all funded through voluntary\ncontributions, provide support to those with Humanitarian Coordinator responsibilities. In 2001, OCHA\nwill have field coordination units in 23 countries.\nIt is these arrangements that have been established to coordinate the humanitarian response of the\nUN system, composed of the six key actors of UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, FAO, WHO and UNDP.\nHowever, each of the six organisations has been set up by its own treaty, is governed by its own inter-\ngovernmental organ that provides overall policy supervision, and is financed almost entirely outside\nthe UN budget largely through voluntary contributions from governments. Although the Secretary-\nGeneral formally appoints the heads of UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and UNDP, he does so only on the\nbasis of approval by major donor governments. The Secretary-General has no legal authority over\nWHO and FAO.\n2.2 Defining Coordination\nThe changing arrangements for humanitarian coordination described above have been accompanied\nby their fair share of definitions of coordination. For a start, there is the IASC’s distinction between\n11\noperational and strategic coordination. Yet in practice on the ground, distinctions between\noperational and strategic coordination appear to serve little purpose (except for those who use them\nin inter-agency arguments about who is responsible for what). Furthermore, for the study team, the\ndistinctions reinforce the impression that there are areas of humanitarian response that are unrelated\nto strategy and all that implies by way of analysis, goals and monitoring.\nPast studies of humanitarian coordination in complex emergencies offer a plethora of definitions.\nWhile the study team did not set out with a definition of coordination, it concluded that one of the\ndefinitions used repeatedly in past studies stood out as one that could prove useful to the UN:\nCoordination is the systematic use of policy instruments to deliver humanitarian assistance\nin a cohesive and effective manner. Such instruments include strategic planning, gathering\ndata and managing information, mobilising resources and ensuring accountability,\norchestrating a functional division of labour, negotiating and maintaining a serviceable\n12\nframework with host political authorities and providing leadership. \nThis definition captures key elements of humanitarian coordination and emphasises a number of\ncoordination functions that this study concludes are all too often missing or weak in UN humanitarian\ncoordination. These include:\n• The importance of using policy instruments in systematic ways – that, is in an organised way\naccording to established procedures rather than in an ad hoc manner;\n• The emphasis on cohesion, bringing elements of a response together;\n• The focus on planning, managing information, accountability, functional divisions of labour and\nsustaining frameworks with political authorities.\nThese points recur throughout this report.\n                                                          \n10\n These figures are subject to debate and verification, given disputes about lead agencies.\n11\n For definition, see the IASC (1998a) IASC Recommendations Related to the Review of the Capacity of the United Nations\nSystem for Humanitarian Action.\n12\n Minear, L., Chelliah, U., Crisp, J., Mackinlay, J. & Weiss, T. (1992) UN Coordination of the International Humanitarian\nResponse to the Gulf Crisis 1990–1992 (Thomas J. Watson Institute for International Studies: Providence, Rhode Island)\nOccasional Paper 13.\n5Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n2.3 The Parameters of the Coordination Debate in the UN\nWithin the UN, perhaps the sole aspect of coordination that is not contentious is the question why\ncoordinate. The answers inevitably focus on maximising the positive impact of humanitarian\nassistance and protection for those in need. By contrast, defining how coordination is done and by\nwhom provokes fierce debate.\nAmong the words used to define coordination were coherence, compatibility, cooperation,\ncollaboration, consultation, concertation, integration, harmonisation, synchronisation, control and\nmanagement.\nFrom these responses and past studies of coordination, tensions emerge. Are we talking about a\nminimal activity that prevents duplication and overlap, or a more integrating activity that seeks to\nharmonise responses as part of a single programme or strategy that becomes more than the sum of\nits parts? These differences reveal one of the unresolved issues that plague UN coordination debates\nand efforts.\nThese tensions are linked to the associated controversies about how coordination gets done, and by\nwhom. UN personnel repeatedly insisted that coordination depends on consensus and that any\nimposition is inappropriate. At the same time all those with, or who have had, coordination\nresponsibilities, expressed frustration with the difficulty – or impossibility – of coordinating without the\nmeans to enforce others to coordinate.\nIn the same vein, as discussed further below, wherever UN agencies have interpreted their\ncoordination role as a remit to impose on others this has generated fierce and widespread resentment\nacross the UN system. This resentment animates the debate among UN agencies about UN\ncoordination models and the question of who within the UN should coordinate.\nThese tensions and realities set the parameters of the debate within the UN about humanitarian\ncoordination and generate the questions that underpin this report. In a humanitarian system that gives\nauthority to no one, how does coordination get done? One of the perennial questions is how to\ncoordinate those unwilling to be coordinated.\n2.4 The Challenges of a Changing Context\nThis study was required to focus primarily on the conduct of UN coordination within the humanitarian\nsystem. Towards the end of this report, the study addresses the question posed by the ToR on the\ninterface of the humanitarian system with political and military actors. Notwithstanding the need for\nimproved performance among the humanitarians, such an ‘intra-humanitarian’ focus can obscure the\nsignificance of political and military actors internationally and within recipient countries in determining\nthe extent of humanitarian space and influencing the conduct of humanitarian action.\nThe role of host governments and belligerents in facilitating or obstructing humanitarian action\nconstitutes the familiar, pivotal challenge for humanitarian coordination, albeit one that frequently\ndisappears in intra-UN debates on coordination. The frequent absence or weakness of government in\ncomplex emergency settings creates the coordination challenge in the first place. Humanitarians are\nrequired to substitute for the process of policy prioritisation and implementation that is the role of\ngovernment, with no higher authority in country to mediate when consensus cannot be found.\nThe complexity of the causes and effects of complex political emergencies, their punishing\nconsequences for human lives and livelihoods, the speed at which events often take place, the huge\nnumbers of people in need, and the insecurity facing civilians and those that seek to help them are\nalso familiar challenges to humanitarian action and its coordination.\n6Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nOther new challenges are also emerging. For instance, while donors call for coordination, statistics on\nhumanitarian assistance show that the management of resources for humanitarian assistance has\nbecome increasingly fragmented, and humanitarian response is increasingly bilateral. In 1988, around\n45% of global humanitarian assistance was given in multilateral contributions to the UN, while bilateral\ndonors retained half of the total. The share of the European Commission (EC), meanwhile, was 5%.\nBy the late 1990s, bilateral donors controlled 62% of humanitarian assistance, the UN received 27%,\nand the EC’s share had risen to 11%. The earmarking of funds to specific activities in a particular\ncountry by donors was also up by a third over the decade.\nFurthermore, the significance of NGOs continues to grow. In 1990, ECHO channelled 30% of its funds\n13\nto NGOs. By 1999 this had risen to more than 65% of a budget that had also increased. By the late\n1990s, most OECD member countries were channelling at least a quarter of their emergency\n14\nassistance through NGOs. Between 1992 and 1999, on average 40% of the CAP was disbursed\nthrough multilateral channels while 22% went through NGOs and 13% through the Red Cross family.\nYet UN agencies also fund NGOs to implement programmes. For example, in 1997, NGOs were the\n15\nchannel for $500m of WFP relief commodities and more than half of UNHCR’s budget.\nHowever, contributions to the CAP have been falling – from $1.96bn in 1994 to $1.4bn in 1999, with\n16\nthe share of requirements met on a steady downward trend from 80% in 1994 to 64% in 1999. Yet\nmore starkly, humanitarian aid as share of wealth of the world’s richest counties is falling – by a third\nover the decade. The market should not be shrinking. The human reality behind that statistic\ndemands powerful advocacy by the UN system and humanitarians more widely to ensure that\ngovernments uphold their humanitarian obligations.\nAt the same time, donors are making greater demands of humanitarian actors to uphold performance\nstandards and increase accountability. Some donors are increasing their capacity in the field to\nscrutinise humanitarian operations, and some also demonstrate increasing interest in coordination at\nthe field level. While the vast majority of this study’s interviewees stressed that the UN retains pre-\neminent responsibility for coordination for the benefit of the entire humanitarian community, both case\nstudies suggest there are some donors - the EC in particular – who are prepared to take a more\n17\nproactive role in coordination, potentially in competition with the UN. Such actors have the capacity\nand interest to fill vacuums left by the UN where it has been discredited or perceived to be ineffective.\nIn certain settings, donor interest has coincided with political agendas to push humanitarian aid to\ncontribute to broader political strategies. The Brahimi report, with its recommendations on the role of\nhumanitarian aid in the as yet undefined activity of peacebuilding, represents the latest attempt to\nexplicitly coopt humanitarian action to deliver on wider political goals of peace and security. (For\nfurther discussion of this see Section 6).\nThe Brahimi report also has other implications. For instance, should its recommendations that the UN\nSecurity Council (UNSC) sanction more robust mandates for UN peace operations be implemented, it\ncould become yet more difficult for UN humanitarian agencies to assert their humanitarian identity.\nThis could complicate coordination as NGOs and others feel forced to distance themselves explicitly\nfrom a non-neutral UN. Conversely, if the report has the effect of ‘raising the bar too high’ and the\nSecurity Council remains resistant to mandating and providing such ‘robust forces’, humanitarian\nactors look likely to be left filling peacekeeping and political vacuums in situations of little strategic\ninterest.\nSuch settings – that is situations of conflict and post-conflict – also look set to be neglected by\ndevelopment actors outside the UN. UN discussion on ‘bridging the gap’ between relief and\ndevelopment may be intense, but there is little sign that other development actors are ‘mainstreaming\nconflict’ into their analysis of development aid and policy.  The focus of the World Bank, among\nothers, on countries that are ‘good policy performers’ begs the question about what happens to the\nbad performers. It seems that one answer is that the ‘bad performers’ are ‘consigned’ to humanitarian\nresponses and actors, while the rest of the world is uninterested.\n                                                          \n13\n See Development Initiatives (2000) Global Humanitarian Assistance 2000. An Independent Report Commissioned by the\nIASC (Inter-Agency Standing Committee, OCHA: Geneva) May.\n14\n Ibid, p. 47.\n15\n Ibid, p. 27.\n16\n In particular, this represents a significant fall in the incomes of UNHCR and WFP. See Development Initiatives (2000) op. cit.\n17\n The role of the EC in the Somalia Aid Coordination Body, and the ECHO representative in North Kivu were striking examples.\nAnother example is ECHO’s cellule de crise established in collaboration with the Rwandan government in 1993.\n7Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3: OBSTACLES AND INCENTIVES TO COORDINATION\nThis section provides an overview of some of the major themes and lessons from past studies,\ninterviews and case studies which are elaborated through the rest of the report. It then looks at the\nstructural, institutional and management obstacles to coordination before presenting some of the\nways these obstacles are overcome.\n3.1 Overview\n3.1.1 Themes from Studies of Complex Emergencies\nAmong the recurring themes of past studies of coordination are turf battles, empire-building,\noverlapping and conflicting mandates, and ad hoc arrangements all of which prevent effective\nresponse. Tensions between staff in the field and headquarters, with each accusing the other of\nthwarting coordination efforts, recur, as do criticisms of poor information flow and conflicting internal\nadministrative procedures that hamper inter-agency collaboration or prevent flexibility and fast\nresponse. The lack of overall strategy or principled approaches is a common feature, as is the\nabsence of integrated programmes or effective joint implementation. Many studies emphasise\ntensions between relief and development agencies, humanitarians and peacekeepers, and\n(consequently) the importance of personalities in making the system work, if at all.\n3.1.2 Themes from Interviews\nIn interviews with many UN staff, the discussion of what works frequently elided into debate about\ncoordination models and the link between coordination and operationality. A refrain among a striking\nnumber of UN interviewees in headquarters was the need to respond to what the donors want. This\nreveals the push for profile in order to maintain or increase funding in the competitive donor funding\nmarket. Yet these same donors are recognised as behaving in contradictory ways, whether through\ntheir behaviour on agency executive boards, cherry picking in the CAP, or in the trend towards\nbilateral control of resources.\nInterviewees spoke of institutional cultures where cooperation is neither required nor rewarded. The\nstudy team gleaned a distinct impression of agencies mimicking the behaviour of UN Member States,\nguarding their agency 'sovereignty' against perceived assaults by others. The content and tone of\nmany of the interviews in UN agency headquarters painted a picture of agencies and individuals\nunwilling to be coordinated; to cede authority to another.\n3.1.3 Themes from Case Studies\nCase studies brought the picture of inter-agency tensions into sharper focus – although they also\nrevealed important examples of effective coordination. In particular, the case studies highlighted how\n‘flexibility’ was a mixed blessing – while allowing room for innovation by exceptional individuals it also\nmuddles lines of accountability and allows tensions and conflicts to go unresolved and to fester. Case\nstudies and interviews stressed that ad interim arrangements can corrode relationships, morale and\nperformance.\nThe lack of clear ToR, reporting relationships and consultation lines, as well as weak or non-existent\nguidance and induction on key job responsibilities, was a theme that emerged throughout the case\nstudy interviews.  Not surprisingly, all too often this resulted in a lack of clarity to those outside the UN\nabout who was responsible for what. Meanwhile many in the UN appeared preoccupied with intra-UN\nconcerns.\n8Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3.2 The Obstacles to Coordination\n3.2.1 Structural Obstacles\nThe design of the ‘system’\nThe primary obstacle to coordination of UN humanitarian agencies is the design of the UN ‘system’. In\nfact, although all UN agencies share a link with the UN Charter, there is little about their structure that\nis systematic. That is, the system of UN humanitarian agencies has not been designed along the lines\nof good management or bureaucratic functionality. Rather, if there is a logic that underpins their\nprovenance and accountability structures, established at different points in time, it is primarily a\npolitical one: Member States have created and structured agencies and organisations in accordance\nwith their political interests.\nIn the face of the potential incursions on sovereignty inherent in the UN Charter, or key humanitarian\nconventions such as those on the rights of refugees or women and children, governments have\nensured that through their governance structures and executive boards, UN agencies remain within\n18\ntheir control. Thus the behaviour of UN agencies cannot be divorced from the actions of UN Member\n19\nStates, whether on agency executive boards, or the political pressure exerted in particular on the\n20\nSecretary-General and UNDP, where many decisions about coordination ultimately reside.\nYet rather than seeking to overcome the political pressures that come from their separate governance\nstructures in the pursuit of coordinated humanitarian response, it seems that the UN agencies mimic\nthe behaviour of the Member States by jealously guarding their agency ‘sovereignty’.\nCountering the push for profile: the influence of the contract culture and the market\nAs little funding for humanitarian response or coordination comes from assessed contributions, UN\n21\nagencies are forced into the situation of competing for the same donor funds. Competitiveness has\n22\nalso therefore been built into the system. Agencies perceive the donor market to be shrinking, as\ndonors increasingly favour bilateral over multilateral channels for humanitarian assistance. This\nfunding environment requires agencies to push for profile, which corrodes relationships and\n23\ncoordination at all levels. In the words of one of the most senior interviewees that the team met:\n‘There is more competition in the UN than in the private sector.’ Ironically, it was a donor who\ncaptured the point: ‘The fight for visibility is an obstacle for coordination.’\nIn this context, it was clear from interviewees that OCHA faces a vicious circle: the more it raises its\nprofile to attract funds and the more that donors support OCHA, the more its role with the agencies is\nundermined as OCHA is seen as a competitor. As one UN agency interviewee remarked: 'OCHA\nexists because donors like coordination, but agencies do not like OCHA.’ This environment that\nmakes market competitors out of humanitarian collaborators is a fundamental obstacle to\ncoordination.\nDonors thwart coordination\nWhile donors are among those that most vociferously demand coordination, donor earmarking,\nmicromanaging, visibility concerns and political agendas all confound humanitarian coordination.\nDonor responses to consolidated appeals are a notorious example of how they undermine faltering\nUN efforts towards integrated responses to humanitarian need. One interviewee suggested that donor\nsupport for OCHA is disingenuous in that it satisfies bureaucratic demands for ‘tidiness’ in the process\nof reporting to ministers and the public, but does not reflect a commensurate commitment from donors\nfor coordinated action. Interviewees and studies remarked that donors’ behaviour on executive boards\n24\nis inconsistent with their statements and funding decisions.\n                                                          \n18\n On the diverse ways that governments retain this control, see Gordenker, L. (1998) ‘Clash and Harmony in Promoting Peace:\nOverview’ in Whitman, J. (ed) ‘Peacekeeping and the UN Agencies’ International Peacekeeping, Vol. 5, No. 4, Winter 1998;\nand Ingram, J. (1993) op. cit.\n19\n NB: G8 members feature more prominently on these executive boards than G77 members do.\n20\n Although the Secretary-General formally appoints the heads of UNICEF, UNDP, UNHCR, he does so only on the basis of\napproval by major donor governments.\n21\n UNHCR, UNEP, UNCHS (Habitat) and UNRWA have portions of their budget that come from the regular budget with the rest\nbeing voluntarily funded. UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF are entirely voluntarily funded.\n22\n  Childers, E. & Urquhart, B. (1991) op. cit., p.53.\n23\n For an example of the tensions between coordination and fundraising pressures, see UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998)\n‘Report of the Tripartite (UNICEF/UNHCR/WFP) Study of the Great Lakes Emergency Operation, September 1996–1997’ p. 4.\n24\n For example, see Gordenker, L. (1998) op. cit.\n9Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nOne study suggests that for all their rhetoric favouring coordination, donors may actually tolerate poor\n25\ncoordination because to do otherwise would require them to coordinate better. This study’s evidence\nsuggests that donors themselves have proved weak at coordination. Donor involvement in\ncoordination structures such as the Somali Aid Coordination Body (SACB) in Nairobi does not appear\nto have increased donor coherence, funding, or political action but has risked skewing humanitarian\nagencies' decisions in favour of political considerations. Interviewees and studies suggested this was\n26\nalso the case for the Afghan Support Group and the Emergency Management Group in Albania.\nAlthough NGOs and Red Cross agencies are by no means immune from the pressure to raise funds,\nit was striking that UN interviewees were the most preoccupied with attracting donor approval. A\nrepeated refrain among UN interviewees was 'If the donors like it'. This may be commensurate with\ntheir more governmental nature compared with the Red Cross or NGOs. Yet given the multiple ways\nin which donors thwart coordination, UN agencies exacerbate the problem when they focus on\ncompeting for funds rather than lobbying donors to reform the system.\n3.2.2 Institutional Obstacles\nCoordination and cooperation are neither required nor rewarded\nOne of the key institutional obstacles to coordination is the strength of UN staff loyalty to their\nagencies rather than to the UN family. Institutional loyalty is not inherently a bad thing, nor is it unique\nto the UN. Yet the study team was struck by how often expressed loyalty to an agency was\n27\naccompanied by at least criticism, if not strong denouncement, of other UN agencies. Within the UN\n28\nit appears that institutional loyalty propagates inter-agency competition.\nThis competition is animated and exacerbated by the fact that coordination and cooperation are rarely\nrequired or rewarded among staff. Interviewees and studies stated that personal professional\n29\nprogress was linked to performing well for one’s agency, not cooperating with others. Interviewees\nacross the UN system expressed unwillingness to release their ‘best people’ for secondment into\ncoordination functions, preferring to retain them to deliver their agency’s mandate. One important\njustification given for this is the belief that maintaining effective agency operations has the greatest\ndirect impact on beneficiaries – the fundamental concern for any humanitarian agency. Yet the task of\neffective coordination is to increase the impact of the overall response and requires skilled and\ncompetent people who are rewarded for their work. Requiring staff to coordinate and seconding staff\nto coordination are essential to the performance of the system.\nCoordinators are not ‘neutral’: the link between coordination and operationality\nA strong theme in interviews was the importance attached to coordinators not having vested\ninstitutional interests – referred to as being ‘neutral’ in inter-agency terms. For many, such interests\nderived from coordinators having to combine responsibility for operations and coordination. As one\nUN staff member commented, ‘You cannot be a player and a referee.’\nFor adherents to this view, operationality – that is, having responsibilities or programmes that directly\nprovide assistance to beneficiaries – is seen as a distraction that precludes coordinators from\nproviding effective support to enable others to achieve their goals. It hinders the coordinating\nagency’s operational programme. It was also argued that only non-operational coordinators should\nmonitor adherence to standards which are critical to effectiveness and accountability.\nDespite the widespread emphasis on the ‘neutrality’ of coordinators, there were some interviewees\nwho maintained that far from being a distraction to coordination, operationality is key to having clout\nand credibility as a coordinator.\n                                                          \n25\n Minear, L. (1998) op. cit.\n26\n For example, see Telford, J. (2000) 'Coordination in the 1999 Kosovo Refugee Emergency: The Emergency Management\nGroup (EMG), Albania – An Evaluation’, 31 January 2000, contracted for DFID.\n27\n The team was also surprised by the emphasis on money in fostering loyalty. Many UN interviewees articulated the view that\nwhoever pays the piper calls the tune. Consequently, the fact that OCHA is not paying all Humanitarian Coordinators was\nperceived to undermine their accountability and loyalty to the ERC.\n28\n For a description of inter-agency rivalries within the Red Cross Movement see Anema, F., Stone, M. & Wissink, H. (2000) ‘An\nExamination of the Role of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s Response to the Balkans Crisis’ (ICRC:\nGeneva) p. vi.\n29\n The US General Accounting Office report that roughly a third of UN staff in the field ‘did not have a job expectation of\ncooperation with other agencies…According to these officials their career, promotion, and reward paths are through their parent\norganisations.’ See US General Accounting Office (2000) 'Report to Congressional Requesters – United Nations: Reform\nInitiatives Have Strengthened Operations, but Overall Objectives Have Not yet Been Achieved'.\n10Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe debate appeared to be animated by agencies staking their claims to coordination roles, for all of\nthis has a direct bearing on particular coordination models (discussed in Section 4). After all,\neveryone seemed clear that the lesson of DHA’s experience was the incompatibility of coordination\nand operational responsibilities and, as stated earlier, the IASC has already agreed that humanitarian\ncoordinators should not have operational responsibilities.\nThus the prevailing view is that operationality and coordination must be separated. There are\nimportant examples of individual coordinators from operational agencies who have garnered the trust\nof others. Yet the critical success factor for these individuals is that they cast their loyalty system-\nwide. It appears that the UN system depends on producing a crop of individuals who stay loyal to their\nagency at the lower and middle levels of their career path, but then somehow shed these affiliations\n30\nfurther up the ranks. Were the UN system able to foster system-wide affiliation and loyalty more\nwidely, the need for ‘neutrality’ might be diluted. But as the system is currently characterised,\ncoordinators that have operational responsibilities and thus vested institutional interests are an\ninstitutional obstacle to coordination.\nThe UN is preoccupied with itself\nDonors, NGOs, and host governments were all clear that the UN has a critical role to play in\ncoordination for the benefit of the entire humanitarian community. However, some within the UN\nappeared less clear on this point. Where this results in a preoccupation among UN staff with UN\naffairs, and subsequent exclusion or neglect of international and local NGOs from the UN’s\n31\ncoordination efforts, this had a clear negative impact on coordination in the eyes of interviewees. \nSome NGOs feel they get little return for the investment they make in UN-led coordination processes\nand structures. In the words of the NGO consortium ICVA: ‘The UN is unable to offer services and\n32\nattitudes commensurate with the partnership demanded by NGOs.’ In some instances, NGOs have\n33\nestablished their own coordination structures that exclude the UN. However, more often, NGO\ncoordination structures have to an extent facilitated coordination with the UN system, for example, in\nKosovo and FRY (excluding Kosovo).\nThe propensity of institutions to be preoccupied with internal affairs is not confined to the UN.\nInterviewees stressed that the Red Cross and large NGO federations experience as many problems\ncollaborating inside their own organisations as between themselves and others. Nor are NGOs either\nhomogenous nor consistent in their decisions about how they relate to the UN in all instances – which\nis in turn a source of frustration to UN agencies. Yet given that the rest of the system is looking to the\nUN to coordinate, when coordinators are preoccupied with intra-UN concerns and neglect key\nhumanitarian actors, coordination is likely to suffer.\nAdministrative procedures prevent fast response and collaboration\nIn contrast to the demand of emergency situations for rapid response, time and again reports and\ninterviewees pointed out that the time lag in deploying key staff and structures impaired\n34\ncoordination. For example, although the March 1993 CAP for Rwanda proposed the creation of a\nhumanitarian coordination unit in Kigali, it was not until January 1994 that staff took up position in the\nDHA unit within UNDP.\nThe clash of administrative procedures also impairs response and hampers coordination. In Somalia,\nthe incompatibility of agency procedures at headquarters, for example, on contracts and\ndisbursements, was cited as one of the biggest problems for the UN Country Team, fuelling\ncompetition over scarce aid resources. The Brahimi report also focuses on information technology\nproblems. This is not the sole preserve of the UN. In Kosovo, different financial systems impaired\n35\ncooperation between the ICRC and Red Cross. However, it is a particular feature of the UN\nagencies as a result of their structures and staffing, and acts as another institutional obstacle to\n36\ncoordination.\n                                                          \n30\n A notable example of this was the decision by Catherine Bertini, when designated the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for\nthe Horn of Africa, to report to the ERC a.i. to demonstrate her commitment to serve the system rather than her agency.\n31\n See Annexe 2 for an example of this, including the contrast between OCHA’s engagement with NGOs.\n32\n See ICVA (2000b).\n33\n See Atkinson, P. & Leader, N. (2000) The ‘Joint Policy of Operations’ and the Principles and Protocols of Humanitarian\nOperations’ in Liberia (London: ODI) HPG Report 3.\n34\n The ECOSOC 2000 humanitarian segment asked for application of special administrative rules and procedures to allow the\nUN to provide personnel and logistics to respond to humanitarian needs.\n35\n Anema et al (2000) op. cit.\n36\n For elaboration of the challenges posed, see Ingram (1993) op.cit.\n11Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3.2.3 Management Obstacles\nAbsence of clear accountability for coordination\nPast studies, cases studies and interviewees all presented a picture of coordination arrangements\ndogged by unclear roles, reporting lines and accountabilities.\nClear reporting lines are critical to effective daily management, accountability and the loyalties they\nsignify. Yet in the DRC, many senior officials were baffled and frustrated by the maze of reporting\n 37\nlines and lack of clarity about how they related to each other. For one example among many, the\nSenior Humanitarian Adviser for the east of the country was required to report in four directions, but\nnone of those included the Provincial Coordinator. Unsurprisingly, donors, the Red Cross and NGOs\nalike all stated that they too were unclear who had responsibility for what inside the UN. Elsewhere,\nsenior individuals with coordination responsibilities confessed that they had ignored unclear multiple\nreporting lines established at the highest levels and had simplified their own reporting relationships.\nIn both the DRC and Somalia, it was striking how a proliferation of coordination structures diffused\naccountability for coordination. In the SACB, it was unclear that the buck finally stopped with the\nExecutive Committee. The absence of systematic consultation procedures between staff in Nairobi\nand their colleagues in Somalia created an impression that few in Nairobi felt accountable for the\nimpact on the ground of their decisions and actions.\nRegional coordination structures have also muddied the water where there has been lack of clarity\nover jurisdiction between regional and country coordinators and a profusion of senior officials, for\n 38\nexample, in Rwanda in 1994 and the Horn of Africa in 2000.\nHolding humanitarian actors more accountable for their contribution to coordination is essential. The\nabsence of consistently used quantitative or qualitative indicators to measure the quality of\ncoordination is one factor that impedes this accountability process. Yet unclear allocation of\nresponsibility and therefore accountability is another obstacle to coordination.\nUnclear guidance and induction\nCase studies and interviewees revealed that a huge range of personnel, from senior officials to junior\nstaff, were sent into the field with little or no guidance in ToR or inductions on matters fundamental to\ntheir role. As one UN interviewee commented, ‘People are tossed into the field and told to get on with\nthe nebulous concept of coordination. If people stay on for two, three, five years, [only then do] they\nfind out about advocacy [or] principles.’ The Brahimi report offers further evidence of the minimal\nbriefing, policy and strategic guidance provided to Force Commanders or heads of mission.\nThere has been some progress, however. The Note of Guidance on the relationship between SRSGs,\nResident Coordinators and Humanitarian Coordinators is one example, although it remains to be seen\nwhat impact this will have in practice. The study team was impressed by FAO’s recently instituted\nprocess whereby its most experienced staff travel to teach younger personnel to enable them to\nbenefit from their experience. Yet these examples appear to be the exception to the rule that unclear\nguidance and induction constitute another obstacle to coordination.\nFlexibility masks ‘adhocracy’\nBy definition, complex emergencies are complicated, precluding a ‘one size fits all’ response. They\nrequire flexible responses that adapt to the precise demands of the situation. Such wisdom is invoked\nto characterise how the UN responds to such crises. Indeed, one study praised the ‘adaptivity’ of the\n39\nUN system. Yet this study team concluded that the term flexibility is often used as a more flattering\nsynonym for ‘adhocracy’. As such, it is used to justify poor management, decisions not made, conflicts\nnot resolved, and the influence of politics on management decisions.\n                                                          \n37\n For a similar example of conflict arising from lack of clear relationships, see Ball, N. & Campbell, K. (1998) ‘Complex Crisis\nand Complex Peace – Humanitarian Coordination in Angola’ (Policy, Information and Advocacy Division, OCHA: New York),\nand Donini et al (1996) op. cit.\n38\n On Rwanda, see Borton, J. (1996) op. cit.\n39\n See Lautze, S., Jones, B. and Duffield, M. (1998) ‘Strategic Humanitarian Coordination in the Great Lakes Region, 1996–\n1997: An Independent Study for the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’, (Policy, Information and Advocacy Division, OCHA:\nNew York).\n12Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe lack of clear accountability or guidance highlighted above are examples of this adhocracy. The\nIASC's management model put in place to effect response to IDPs, and disarmament, demobilisation,\nand reintegration, is another case in point. It appears to be a continual process of deferring decisions\nabout divisions of labour to another body whether upwards, for example, to the Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral, or downwards, to the UN Country Team. The fact that the highest levels of the UN have also\nbeen responsible for ad hoc developments reinforces the impression that political concerns prevail\n40\nover effective performance, management and meritocracy. \nOne of the apparent ironies of ‘flexible’ arrangements is that they are both vulnerable to be changed\nat any moment, and may be left to fester with dysfunctions going ignored. This was particularly true of\nthe ad interim arrangements encountered by the team. Ad interim arrangements within the UN dilute\nand undercut the authority of the individual, the position and the structures. Individuals in ad interim\npositions face an uphill struggle to convince others of their legitimacy and authority; where they fail to\npersuade, the resistance to coordinate can degenerate into in-fighting and freelancing by agencies\nand individuals. Clearly this corrodes relationships, morale and performance. The string of\nhumanitarian coordinators in the DRC is a pre-eminent example of the negative impact of ad interim\nmeasures. Agencies in the DRC referred to the ‘HC ad hoc’.\nSuch adhocracy puts a huge onus on individuals to work things out on the ground. On the positive\nside, such adhocracy – where requirements or systems are not set in stone – offers room for\ninnovation. Negatively, the weak management associated with adhocracy allows the incompetent or\n 41\nmalign to under perform or create chaos. As not every situation is entirely different, it involves a lot\nof reinventing of the wheel, which of course is an unnecessary effort. As one interviewee commented,\n’Everywhere I go the UN is different and I am having to adapt to the UN.’\nOn the evidence of past studies, case studies and interviews, such adhocracy seems to be built into\nthe UN system. As such, it appears to be both a product and a cause of resistance to coordination.\n3.3 So When Does Coordination Happen?\nThis, then, is the picture gleaned by the team of some of the lessons from recent coordination\nexperience. However, these same studies, interviews and case studies also show that over a decade\nthere have been efforts to make coordination more systematic. More effort is now put into deciding\ncoordination arrangements. Many ‘habits’ of coordination have been regularised. The CAP and the\nIASC were the most cited evidence of such habits, and are examples of fora in which joint action has\nbecome unquestioned practice.\nThrough the case studies, the team found some examples of collaboration and coordination of the\nresponses to people in need on the ground. So the question is what are the ingredients in these\nsuccessful examples? How have they dealt with the obstacles outlined above? The following section\nsets out some of the team’s findings on the factors that promote humanitarian coordination.\n3.4 The Ingredients of Success\n3.4.1 Where Contexts are Conducive to Coordination\nOne conducive context is one in which relationships have been built over time. A striking example\nof this was in Gedo region in Somalia where three NGOs had gone beyond coordination to establish a\nconsortium to maximise economies of scale when hiring consultants for the training of their staff in\nhealth programmes. The close cooperation in Nairobi of the organisations’ managers and\nrelationships established by staff through shared use of one agency’s guest house as a key staging\npost for the cross-border operation were cited as the factors behind this.\n                                                          \n40\n For one example among many, see Minear et al (1992) on the confusion that arose during the Gulf War when UNHCR’s\ndesignation as lead agency was followed by the creation of the Office of the Executive Delegate (OED) and the appointment of\nan OED Coordinator in Baghdad in addition to there being a Resident Coordinator in Iraq with counterparts across the region.\n41\n The Brahimi report is extremely robust on the necessity for the Secretary-General and his senior staff to be more systematic\nin removing incompetent staff and rewarding excellence.\n13Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nIn a similar vein, shared technical expertise, often a feature of coordination at the sectoral level,\nfacilitates communication and increases focus on how to achieve shared goals rather than agency\nprofiles. One important study of coordination in the Great Lakes highlighted the positive effects of\n42\ntechnical staff working together to overcome obstacles.\n3.4.2 Where Incentives are Increased\nAgencies have to work together in the interests of security…\nThe pressure to sustain humanitarian space in the face of a threat to, or abuse of, aid, or the\nrealisation of the potential negative impact of aid, were factors that spurred humanitarian actors to\ncoordinate in Liberia in 1996, and in Sudan and Somalia. Threats to agencies themselves also\nsparked coordination in these instances.\n...or to achieve access to beneficiaries\nIn some large-scale emergencies the initial period is chaotic. However, in East Timor in 1999 and\nRwanda in 1994, agencies’ keenness to know what others were doing and concern to get advice\nabout who best to help spurred on coordination. In East Timor, because all agencies went in at the\nsame time there were no pre-established hierarchies and all agencies encountered the same\nproblems in trying to find housing and office space. There was thus a compelling need to coordinate\nfor effective operations.\nDonor or media scrutiny requires or supports coordination\nThe reverse of donors thwarting coordination is concern by donors to see coordination being done.\nThe media can act as a key conduit for this information, particularly in settings where donors do not\nhave presence. Donors on the ground can demand it for themselves, such as ECHO in North Kivu or\ndonor members of the SACB.\nCoordinators are vested with elements of command or control\nThe study found a recurring paradox among interviewees: a repeated insistence on inter-agency\nconsensus-building but implicit recognition that timely, effective humanitarian response requires\npower of command.\nThis is borne out by past studies. The team was struck by the number of studies of coordination\nconsidered successful over the last 10 years in which the coordinators had been vested with elements\nof command or control at critical stages in the response. Through control over funds and/or access,\nthese coordinators were able to buttress their claim to authority.\nIn the Great Lakes, ECHO’s decision in the 1994/95 period to channel its funds to NGOs through\nUNHCR underpinned UNHCR’s claims to coordinate. In other cases, coordinators have, in effect,\nbeen able to offer a financial reward to participants in coordination. In Angola, the quick disbursing\nmechanism of the UN Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit for Angola (UCAH) funded by SIDA\nwas very successful at providing NGOs with seed money, so strengthening UCAH’s coordination\n43\nrole. In the DRC, OCHA’s $4m Emergency Humanitarian Initiative (EHI) fund has enabled it to\nsupport logistics and provide non-food items for UN agencies and NGOs in a way critical to their\n44\ncredibility. Indeed, the CERF was partly set up to give DHA some ‘power of the purse’.\nOne of the pre-eminent examples of the coordinator having control of access was UNHCR’s\ncoordination role in the refugee camps of Ngara, Tanzania in 1994. With the backing of the Tanzanian\ngovernment (as well as the major donors), the agency was able to limit the number of NGOs in\nBenaco camp. The limited number of personnel and agencies and the ‘incredible individuals’\ncoordinating engendered ‘an unusually collaborative approach contributing to a highly effective\n45\nresponse’. In East Timor in 1999, the Humanitarian Coordinator could influence access to the island,\nwhich contributed to the authority of the coordination services.\n                                                          \n42\n UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998) op. cit.\n43\n UCAH and UN agencies reviewed NGO project proposals and referred successful ones to SIDA, which generally approved\nfunding less than two weeks after submission. Agencies had a high likelihood of further funding once they had established a\ntrack record.\n44\n Ingram (1993) op. cit.\n45\n Borton, J. (1996) op. cit.\n14Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThere are important caveats. In the cases cited as the most effective, it was important that other\nparticipants welcomed these elements of command as legitimate. Such legitimacy derived from how\nthese elements of control were wielded – that is, whether they were accompanied by coordinators\nwho demonstrated a mentality of inclusion and service orientation. What the examples also show is\nthe importance of the quality of the decisions made. Thus coordination with command maximises its\nclaim to legitimacy if it is coordination at the service of the system with the aim of improving the\nresponse to people in need. This is discussed further in the section on leadership immediately below.\n3.4.3 Where the Coordination on offer Adds Value\nIt is widely agreed that effective coordination must add value to a humanitarian operation by\nfacilitating better quality and more effective and efficient responses to help those in need than would\nbe done in its absence. Some of the tasks and techniques that add value are set out in Section 5. A\ncrucial ingredient is leadership.\nThe importance of leadership\nCommand alone – except from the Secretary-General or an agency head – does not work in a\ndecentralised system that zealously protects consensus as the basis for inter-agency relations. But\nexperience suggests that the UN’s decentralised system can cohere around a leader who provides\ndirection in an inclusive way for the benefit of the system and beyond. Such leaders have come\nclosest to the exercise of authority that is a vital ingredient to go beyond mandate-driven activities to\nachieve more integrated humanitarian responses. Leadership is the common ingredient in the\nexperiences of humanitarian coordination judged by interviewees and studies as the most\n46\nsuccessful.\nThe examples all contain at least one of two key leadership elements: effective managerial skills,\nand/or analytical skills. Some leader-coordinators have command at their fingertips, or at least\nelements of it, such as control over funding and access. For others, their leadership is sufficiently\ndynamic or visionary to act as a proxy for other forms of authority and influence.\nThe team was struck by the significance of the ‘intellectual route’ to authority and influence within the\nUN – that is, the value added to humanitarian operations by analytical leaders who offer clarity,\nstructure and direction for both field operations and humanitarian advocacy initiatives. This was very\nmuch in evidence in the DRC, where key OCHA staff members offered insightful and visionary\nanalysis that the UN and NGOs used to guide their response. Descriptions of the functions of\ncoordination often fail to capture the significance of leaders who are able to offer a vision of what\nhumanitarian action is trying to achieve and who have the ability to make people feel part of achieving\nit.\nFor all coordinators who have to persuade others to accept their leadership, some of the ingredients\nfor success are the importance of experience in disaster management, an inclusive style,\ncommitment, and humility.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, service orientation is also a critical characteristic for a\ncoordinator. In the words of one NGO in the DRC, ‘If they want to coordinate, it is important that they\nare aware of the partners’ policies and needs. They also have to know how to assist.’ UN\ninterviewees placed great emphasis on the importance of coordinators understanding and respecting\nmandates. Such understanding was cited as an ingredient for success in the initial phase in East\nTimor in 1999, and as key to the Coordinator's ability to make persuasive suggestions about how to\naddress duplication or fill gaps.\nBuilding a team is another important aspect of leadership. This requires openness and transparency\non the part of the coordinator, and an ability to foster trust among all players. Yet effective leaders\nalso find the balance between consultation and moving forward. A former Humanitarian Coordinator in\nBurundi was praised for her dynamism and capacity to organise people to get decisions made and\nimplemented. Clearly, such individuals are a key asset to the humanitarian community.\n                                                          \n46\n DHA in Rwanda in 1994, OCHA in Afghanistan, the Humanitarian Coordinator and UCAH in Angola, OCHA in eastern and\nwestern DRC in 2000, the former Humanitarian Coordinator in Burundi, the former Humanitarian Coordinator in East Timor, the\ncurrent Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator in Somalia and the current Humanitarian Coordinator in FRY (excluding Kosovo)\nwere all described as ‘adding value’ through their leadership.\n15Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nBecause there are individuals who appear to work magic on recalcitrant and resistant agencies, there\nseems to be little focus on buttressing the role of effective Coordinators by stronger requirements to\ncoordinate among UN staff. Yet this with combining effective leaders could further increase the\nlikelihood of effective coordination.\nThe right personalities\nThe focus on talented individuals is a theme that continually crops up in studies on coordination.\nIndeed personality was the most cited ingredient by interviewees for successful humanitarian\ncoordination. For example, the problematic and unclear relationship between OCHA and UNDP in\nAfghanistan ‘found a constructive way of functioning largely because of the personalities of key\n 47\ncharacters, albeit at the cost of much time and effort on their part’. Yet by contrast, the personality\nclash between a previous representative of the EC and a former Resident Coordinator in Somalia\n48\nproduced virtual deadlock across the coordination structure.\nThis highlights that while collaborative and adaptable personalities can overcome obstacles, this\nshould not be depended upon. As Donini (1996) warns: ‘As individuals move on, and different\ncharacters arrive, the structural cracks in the system may become critical.’\nThe right capacities, competencies, tools and resources\nPerhaps a more dependable feature of successful coordination than personality is ensuring that\nCoordinators have the right capacities and competencies. Interviewees in particular stressed the\nimportance of this. This highlighted for the team the importance of IASC agreement on the key\ncompetencies for Humanitarian Coordinators. One interviewee suggested that the Pittsburgh testing\nprocedure currently used to select Resident Coordinators was having adverse outcomes for the pool\nof possible Humanitarian Coordinators, as those who exhibit leadership skills fare less well against a\n49\nResident Coordinator-designed scale looking for consensus building. This requires further study.\nThe small number of female Coordination staff is also important to explore.\nYet few individuals coordinate effectively alone. It is clear from all the evidence that having sufficient\ntime, money and skilled staff to perform coordination functions and provide key coordination services\n50\nis a fundamental feature of coordination that adds value. Little is specified in terms of how\ncoordinators are supported. All the IASC and ECHA literature on the subject of models is notably\nsilent on OCHA’s role. Thus little is said about the required competencies of support staff, although\nanalytical and information management skills were valued on the ground and mentioned by some\ninterviewees. Studies and staff also argued that OCHA field offices required some staff with technical\nspecialisms in order to act as effective interlocutors and facilitators of the work of operational\n51\nagencies. Agreeing the required competencies and capacities for all coordination staff and recruiting\nstaff accordingly is clearly an important element for effective coordination.\nSignificantly, what dogged all discussions was the impression of a dearth of suitable staff. The UN\nDevelopment Group and OCHA are seeking to address this, but the team remained puzzled why\ncandidates with the likely combination of skills for coordinators and support staff should prove so\nelusive to the UN. Yet it appears that this is true at all levels. As the Brahimi report points out, 'The\ncurrent UN approach to recruiting, selecting, training and supporting its mission leaders leaves major\nroom for improvement.'\n3.4.4 The Value of Systematisation\nIn theoretical literature, predictability emerges as an elusive but vital ingredient in effective\ncoordination. If adhocracy is one of the obstacles to coordination, so making things more systematic\nis its antidote. Doing things wherever possible according to agreed plans and established procedures\nhelps to avoid reinvention of the wheel and minimise unintended consequences in order to produce\nmore efficient and effective outcomes. Overall, strengthening management systems will have a\npositive impact on this. In addition, greater planning in advance, rosters of available staff and well-\n 52\nwritten Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) should also increase the likelihood of coordination. \n                                                          \n47\n Donini et al (1996) op. cit. p. 24.\n48\n However, this deadlock was circumvented in 1997 during the el niño flooding when UNICEF had the lead coordination role.\n49\n For instance, Resident Coordinators have been found to emphasise process rather than product. See Office of Evaluation\nand Strategic Planning (1996) ‘Evaluation on Strengthening the Work of the Resident Coordinators’, UNDP.\n50\n For examples of Coordinators’ effectiveness undermined by lack of resources see UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998) op. cit.\n51\n For example, see Borton, J. (1996) op. cit. p. 9.\n52\n For strong recommendations on the value of all three of these elements, see UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998) op. cit.\n16Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nFor example, planning in advance was described as the nub of success in the first weeks of the East\nTimor response. By virtue of being stuck in Darwin, the humanitarian agencies had already started to\nprepare a CAP and funding for preparedness. A US government report applauded the plan that\n'included all anticipated activities, considered overall logistics needs, and…resulted in deploying the\nmission more quickly and with fewer problems than past operations of comparable size and\n53\ncomplexity.’\nYet the East Timor case was rare in that it concentrated all the agencies in one place in advance of\nthe response who, as a result, knew something of the challenges they faced. Such knowledge is the\nexception rather than the rule, complicating the planning process. As Suhkre et al (2000) point out in\nconsidering UNHCR’s surge capacity, for what size emergency should UNHCR prepare? Their\nanswer is that UNHCR needs to become good at mobilising resources from elsewhere, rather than\nstanding capacity, and prioritise shared resources such as warehousing, transport and\ncommunications that provide a bridge between the discrete assistance packages of other actors and\n54\nfacilitate the overall response.\nFor more than a decade, the creation of rosters of rapidly available staff has been repeatedly\nrecommended to support coordination. Indeed, UNGA Resolution 46/182 made no distinction\nbetween complex emergencies and natural disasters in arguing for a roster of skilled, experienced\nand available officials. For three years the IASC has talked about establishing a roster of qualified\ncandidates so that in the instance that a Resident Coordinator does not have Humanitarian\nCoordinator skills, s/he can be replaced. However, there remains no roster. The IASC recently\nestablished a training process aimed at emergency field coordination teams, only to delink this from\n55\nthe idea of a roster of readily available officials. A decade after 46/182 recommended a roster,\nagencies seem unwilling or unable to make staff available at short notice to be part of inter-agency\ncoordination teams. It hardly needs to be said that the UN should not wait another decade to\nimplement this vital measure.\nMoUs have proved valuable to build in greater –- and much needed – predictability amid the flux of\nresponses to fast-changing events. For example, the UNHCR/WFP MoU is one that has helped to\nclarify respective roles and responsibilities. In 1991, a seminal proposal on UN reform proposed that a\n‘comprehensive assignment of responsibilities within the UN system in humanitarian emergencies’ be\n56\nset out and, in consultation with agency heads, ‘propose any adjustments indicated by experience’.\nClearly, when focusing on the UN, one of the enduring problems with agreeing such a matrix of\nresponsibilities is that mandates overlap or have gaps in them. However, in the absence of more\nradical structural change to address this, making UN humanitarian coordination more systematic and\npredictable is essential to mitigate the current blight of adhocracy that all too often impairs effective\nhumanitarian response.\n3.4.5 A Commitment to the Beneficiaries\nThere is one further key ingredient for effective humanitarian action and coordination upon which\neven the best laid plans and procedures depend: a focus on the people who are in need. No\nstructures or incentives can fundamentally compensate for lack of commitment to an effective,\ncoordinated response to the needs of beneficiaries. Indeed, often such focus and commitment has to\ncompensate for the absence of effective plans and procedures, and to overcome the obstacles that\nstand in the way of coordinated responses. Yet all too often, the pressures to play to agency goals\nand agendas can obscure the fundamental goal of any humanitarian response. In the words of one\nUN agency member in the DRC, ‘The focus here is not on the “product”. No one has thought what am\nI here to manufacture?’ It is a familiar adage: the greater the commitment and the closer that agencies\nget to people in need of assistance and protection, the greater the likelihood of coordination.\n                                                          \n53\n US General Accounting Office (2000) 'Report to Congressional Requesters – United Nations: Reform Initiatives Have\nStrengthened Operations, but Overall Objectives Have Not yet Been Achieved', May.\n54\n Suhrke, A., Barutciski, M., Sandison, P. & Garlock, R.

Furthermore, some of the obstacles are beyond the immediate control of UN\nagencies, given their structure and the behaviour of Member States.\nHowever, there are a number of factors that are within the remit of UN humanitarian agencies to\ninfluence, and the discussion of when coordination happens suggest that such factors have a\nsignificant impact on the effectiveness and quality of coordination. To summarise, the likelihood of\ncoordination is maximised when:\n• Coordinators have sufficient competence, management skills, dynamism and vision to give them\nauthority to persuade or encourage others to coordinate.\n• Coordinators have elements of command at their fingertips, such as control over funding and\naccess, in order to increase the incentives or requirements of others to coordinate.\n• Coordination is carried out by those who do not have vested institutional interests but rather\nprovide services for the whole system, and for whom coordination is a full-time job.\n• The Coordinator is supported by skilled staff to perform essential functions and services.\n• There is effective accountability for coordination through clear structures and reporting lines,\nincluding clarity on who deputises for the Coordinator and what his/her responsibilities will be.\nThis requires monitoring and assessment to ensure that good performance is rewarded and poor\nperformance is sanctioned.\nThese are some of the essential ingredients of effective coordination. The challenge to the UN is to\nensure that these are consistent characteristics of all coordination structures.\n18Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n4: THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF COORDINATION MODELS\n4.1 Do the UN Models Matter?\nFor UN agencies, the question of who coordinates is a major preoccupation in any discussion on\nhumanitarian coordination. Yet this discussion – confined as it is to a highly partisan debate which\nrevolves around conflicting assertions of the merits of three different ‘models’ of UN arrangements –\nobscures more than it reveals.\nFirstly, the debate obviates any discussion about the roles or relationship with warring parties, local\ncommunities of host governments – whether weak, malign or absent. Yet such roles and relationships\npose central coordination challenges for the UN and humanitarians in the first place. There may not\nbe a legitimate governing authority that has the concern or capability to care for populations, or that\ncan be effectively held accountable for this, leaving humanitarian agencies subject to no authority in-\ncountry. On the other hand, these actors may the pivotal players in coordination.\nSecondly, the team was struck by the fact that, in tribute to the adhocracy of the system, even cursory\ninspection of the UN’s ‘models’ reveals that there is much that changes from one setting to another.\nThis begs the question whether the models as described are the key determinant of coordination\noutcomes.\nOther critical variables that may determine the outcome of the coordination arrangements include the\nrange of actors involved (UN, NGOs, donors), the physical location and space between those being\ncoordinated, reporting lines, frequency of coordination activities, and the nature of the activities\n57\nthemselves. The different role(s) played by the coordination support services and functions, such as\nthose provided by OCHA, may be a key determinant of the impact of coordination. In the case of the\ncombined Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator, the presence of a UNDP senior deputy to take on\nmanagement responsibility for the UNDP programme may also be a critical factor. Given that\ncoordination in complex emergencies is a full-time function and coordinators are required to travel in-\n58\ncountry and further afield, whoever is required to deputise for the coordinator may have an impact. \nFinally, donor willingness to fund the costs of adequately resourced coordination is another factor that\nis of fundamental importance in determining coordination outcomes.\nThe brief discussion below presents the study’s findings on the advantages and disadvantages of the\nthree models of humanitarian coordination as specified by the IASC. It draws on the debate around\nthe links between coordination and operationality discussed briefly in Section 3, as well as the\ningredients of successful coordination outlined above to make conclusions about the strengths and\nweaknesses of each arrangement.\n4.2 The Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator: the ‘Combined Model’\nToday in 14 countries where there are complex emergencies the UN Country Team is led by the\nResident Coordinator – usually the Resident Representative (RR) of UNDP – who is also the\nHumanitarian Coordinator.\nThe attractiveness of this model, particularly to parts of the UN Secretariat, appears to stem from its\nability to provide a sense of uniformity to coordination arrangements globally. According to\ninterviewees, at the field level the model has made sense in settings such as Somalia and\nAfghanistan, both of which are dogged by chronic political conflict and characterised by the lack of\n59\nclear distinction between humanitarian, rehabilitation and developmental action. A perceived\nstrength of the combined model is its ability to alleviate 'the gap’ between relief and development.\nUNDP’s willingness to bear the costs of coordination is viewed as another major point in its favour.\n                                                          \n57\n John Telford, pers. com. On the role of host governments, see Duffield, Jones & Lautze (1998), and Sommers , M. (2000)\nThe Dynamics of Coordination (Thomas J. Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown University: Providence, Rhode\nIsland) Occasional Paper 40.\n58\n Rotating the deputy role within the UN Country Team has been one way of team-building. By contrast, in Kosovo, a long-\nrunning dispute over whether the Humanitarian Coordinator should name the head of the OCHA field office as his deputy was a\nsource of frustration to all staff involved.\n59\n However, for a counter view on how the developmental focus of the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator shaped the\nhumanitarian response, see Bradbury, M. & Coultan, V. (2000) Somalia Inter-Agency Flood Response Operation Phase 1,\nNovember-December. An Evaluation (UNICEF Somalia: Nairobi).\n19Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nYet the IASC’s work on post-conflict reintegration shows that this coordination model alone will not\nguarantee closure of ‘the gap’ between relief, rehabilitation and development action. This suggests\nthat other factors – such as the analysis, vision, strategy and teamwork of coordination structures –\nare more important.\nA widely felt disadvantage of this model centres on the difficulties for a UNDP Resident Coordinator\nwho is mandated to work closely with the government of the country in carrying out the robust\ndiplomacy integral to the role of Humanitarian Coordinator – for example, on the rights of refugees or\n60\nIDPs. On the other hand, some people noted this tension is true for all UN agencies that have\nobligations towards governments. Another disadvantage is the preoccupation some incumbents have\nwith UNDP and developmental matters to the exclusion of humanitarian priorities.\nThe fiercest criticism of this model, however, was that Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators who have\nthe competence and experience to effectively coordinate humanitarian action are in the minority.\nMany interviewees expressed frustration that though the IASC and the UNDP Administrator have both\ndeclared their willingness to replace Resident Coordinators who lack the experience or skills to also\nbe Humanitarian Coordinators, this seldom happens. On the rare occasion when there is inter-agency\nagreement to replace a Resident Coordinator the evidence suggests that action is thwarted by the\ndearth of available candidates.\nThere are efforts being made to enlarge the pool of potential Resident Coordinators and to assess\nthem against a range of competencies that are judged necessary for humanitarian coordination. This\ncan only be welcomed. However, the study team noted concerns about the process by which these\ncompetencies had been agreed and concluded that there needs to be greater transparency and\ndebate on the required competencies among IASC members. The key question is whether this\nprocess will bring about results quickly enough for the beneficiaries of tomorrow’s complex\nemergencies.\n4.3 The Humanitarian Coordinator Separate From the Resident Coordinator\nThe separation of the tasks of Humanitarian Coordinator and Resident Coordinator into two posts\noccurs relatively infrequently. The separation of roles occurs when the Resident Coordinator lacks the\nexperience or capacity to undertake the role of Humanitarian Coordinator, when there is no Resident\nCoordinator, when the emergency requires a regional approach, or when the scale of the emergency\nwarrants it. It is often seen as a temporary option. Examples include regional coordinators in the Horn\nof Africa in 1999, in the Great Lakes in 1998, in the DRC in 1996, and the current humanitarian\ncoordinators in Kosovo, East Timor and Moscow.\nAccording to the research for this study, the great advantage of this model is the value of having\nsomeone specifically experienced, competent and focused on humanitarian coordination, including\nsomeone with skills in leadership, management and advocacy that have been specifically honed in\nresponse to the particular challenges of humanitarian emergencies.\nLautze, Jones and Duffield (1998) conclude that humanitarian coordination structures should emulate\nthe governance structures of the country/crisis and thus that a separate Humanitarian Coordinator\nshould be appointed where territory is divided between warring parties. Sudan, Somalia, and the DRC\nare all examples of this. However, all three cases highlight the risk that perspectives among\ncoordination staff polarise on either side of borders or frontlines if there is insufficient flow of\ninformation and people across the boundaries. The debate over the value of a separate Humanitarian\nCoordinator has resumed once more in the DRC as the country continues to be divided among\nseveral warring parties with whom humanitarian actors must negotiate and interact. NGOs in\nparticular are advocates for a separate Humanitarian Coordinator both for the reason of the country’s\n61\ndivided governance and the scale of the task.\n                                                          \n60\n See Sommers (2000) op.cit; also Van Brabant, K. (1997) The Coordination of Humanitarian Action: the case of Sri Lanka\n(ODI: London) Relief and Rehabilitation Network Paper 23.\n61\n See SCHR (2001) ‘The Democratic Republic of Congo: A Forgotten Emergency’ Briefing Note, February.\n20Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe sole disadvantage associated with this model is the confusion that arises when the precise roles\nof the Humanitarian Coordinators and Resident Coordinators have not been clear. The fact that reality\nrarely conforms to the neat distinctions of the ‘relief-to-development continuum’, and the increasing\nemphasis that humanitarians should consider and regularly review the potential applicability of the\n‘developmental issues’ of sustainability and capacity building from the outset of any response,\nsuggests that dividing the humanitarian and developmental roles is a recipe for confusion. It presents\nthe possibility of entrenching false distinctions between relief and development in intellectual and\noperational terms, thus creating another layer or interface for coordination.\nThis disadvantage is a significant one. However, the study team was struck by the strength of the\nwidespread view among interviewees that humanitarian coordination separate from the role of the\nResident Coordinator should be the norm, in contrast to the documents of the IASC that suggest the\nseparate Humanitarian Coordinator should be the exception.\n4.4 The Lead Agency Model\nA recurring theme in past studies of lead agencies is the lack of clarity surrounding how lead agencies\n62\nare designated and what their coordination responsibilities are. This is partly a reflection of the fast\nmoving events that lead to what Cunliffe and Pugh (1996) describe as the ‘resort to reliance’ to the\n63\nmost established agency on the ground. For example, UNHCR was lead agency in the Former\n64\nYugoslavia for roughly a year before it specified its own role. Currently in North Korea and Kosovo\nthere is debate about whether the coordination structures in place are lead agencies or not. In the\nDRC, a coordinator from an operational agency was also unclear whether he was in a lead agency\nmodel. Lead agency examples include UNHCR’s role in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo in\n1999/2000 as part of the UNMIK Humanitarian Pillar I, UNICEF’s role in south Sudan until 1999, and\nWFP’s current role in North Korea, among others.\nHowever, interviewees criticised ‘the temptations of imperialism’ inherent in the lead agency model,\nreferring to the lead agency tendency to define the humanitarian problem ‘in its own image’ so that it\nconformed to the lead agency’s mandate. It was argued that in several instances lead agencies had\ninsufficient capacity or interest to coordinate effectively, but instead a vested interest in their own\n65\noperations.\nYet the fact that one of the criteria for lead agency designation is that the assistance required is\nclosely related to its mandate suggests that this is an understandable tendency. In response to rapid\nonset emergencies, such as the refugee outflows from Kosovo in 1999, a lead agency is likely to be\npre-occupied with establishing its own response rather than undertaking system-wide coordination.\nSimilarly, the fact that lead agencies are so designated because they are on the ground points to what\nis often the reality: that other agencies are not there. The lead agency fills the vacuum created by\nothers’ absence, forced by circumstance – often including pressure from donors – to take on activities\n66\noutside its mandate.\nOne interviewee noted that the predominance of the programme weakens normal accountabilities and\nenables the agency to pursue a path separate to that of the ERC and the rest of the system. ‘UNICEF\nbecame lead agency in Sudan as a result of UNICEF’s then chief being sent “to negotiate something”\nin 1989. The sheer scale of the UNICEF programme led to leadership taking on a life of its own – in\nthe same way that in Bosnia, UNHCR, with its 850 internationals contributed a separate power\nstructure and felt able to flout normal accountabilities.’\n                                                          \n62\n For example, Suhrke et al (2000) op. cit., and Cunliffe & Pugh (1996) The UNHCR As Lead Agency in the Former\nYugoslavia, The Journal of Humanitarian Assistance.\n63\n See Cunliffe & Pugh (1996) op.cit.\n64\n Although UNHCR was requested by Perez de Cuellar on 25 October 1991 to provide assistance to displaced people in the\ndisintegrating Yugoslav federation, his routine letter did not specify lead agency status. By May 1992 in his report, the\nSecretary-General talked of a ‘lead agency’ but without detail of what this entailed.\n65\n For example, see Telford (2000) op.cit.\n66\n See Minear et al (1994) op. cit.\n21Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe most damning criticism, however, in interviews, case studies and past studies concerns the\ntendency of the lead agency to interpret coordination as control, or ‘to ensure it is done’ as ‘do it\nyourself’. Even once other agencies had arrived, this tendency to interpret coordination as ‘doing’ led\n67\nto ineffective delegation and a consequent failure to tap into the expertise of others. By interpreting\nthe role in this way, lead agencies were accused of causing a spiralling circle of negative\nconsequences, skewing the definition of the problem, succumbing to mandate creep, showing little\ninterest in others’ operations, and seeking to direct others.\nOne lead agency case that escaped any criticism was WFP’s lead agency experience in North Korea.\nInterviewees argued that the predominance of WFP’s work in the overall humanitarian effort\nincreased WFP’s ‘stakes’ in the overall response. The Humanitarian Coordinator coming from WFP\nwas widely praised for his effectiveness, which was attributed to his clear-thinking, inclusive style and\nhumility.\n4.5 Conclusion: So Who Should Coordinate?\nThe preoccupation with criteria for choosing models presupposes that there are mechanisms that can\nuse them and that lack of clarity is the issue. Yet the impression is that criteria get lost amid the\ndemands of inter-agency politics, particularly those of the major UN operational agencies, and that\nselection of coordination arrangements is only weakly connected to lessons from past performance or\nthe demands on the context (see discussion of the IASC in Section 5).\nEven if clarity were the issue, this study cannot offer definitive evidence comparing the impact of\ndifferent models and arrangements on the humanitarian response and the lives of beneficiaries. As\nnoted above, the variables are far more multiple than the UN discussions admit. However, on the\nbasis of the discussion above, the study team came to a number of conclusions:\n1. Section 3 set out some of the essential ingredients in successful coordination. These\nprovide clear criteria for any coordination structure to fulfil: that humanitarian coordination is\nrecognised as a full-time task requiring particular skills and competencies, and that it must be\n \nresourced, performed and respected as such. The coordination role requires skilled support\nteams, clear lines of accountability for coordination, carried out by players with no vested\ninstitutional interest who performs a service for the whole humanitarian community.\n2. The model debate focuses largely on the ‘top’ of the coordination structure – that is, how it gets\nled – and pays little attention to specifying what and how coordination services and functions are\n68\nprovided. This has led to unhelpful tensions around OCHA’s role, reporting lines, the extent of\nits presence at sub-office level and the question of who deputises for Humanitarian Coordinators.\n(It also heightened the team’s impression that the Secretariat and the major UN operational\nagencies risk prioritising the desire for simplicity over a concern with the detail of coordination on\nthe ground.) The IASC should focus more on coordination teams and structures, not solely\non responsibilities at the top. Clear specifications with regard to these structures, their\nfunctions, the required personnel competencies and the reporting relationships should form part\nof all decisions on coordination options considered by the UN and the rest of the IASC.\n3. If the Secretary-General and the IASC’s decisions continue to favour appointing a combined\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator, the disadvantages of this will be have to be mitigated by\nhaving a pool of high-calibre candidates who possess competencies that are agreed to be\napplicable for both roles, a rigorous system of performance monitoring by the ERC to ensure that\nthose in place are playing their role effectively, and a decisive and professional approach to\nremove or replace Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators when they are found wanting. UNDP’s\ncurrent efforts to ensure that the UNDP programme is run by a competent deputy to allow the\nResident Coordinator to focus on coordination are also essential to the success of this option.\n                                                          \n67\n See Cunliffe & Pugh (1996) op. cit.; also Minear et al (1994) op. cit.\n68\n This was not true of the inter-agency mission sent to the DRC in November 2000 that did make recommendations that OCHA\nbe strengthened to provide more systematised support to the provincial coordinators at the sub-office level.\n22Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n4. Secondments have provided a valuable pool of candidates for Humanitarian Coordinator and\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator positions in the past and have had the added benefit of\n69\ntapping into the skills, resources and credibility of the seconding agency. Secondments can also\ncontribute to greater system-wide affiliation rather than narrow agency loyalty. In addition, they\nspread the costs of coordination. The challenge remains to persuade agencies to second their\npeople in the first place. One suggestion to overcome this was that coordinators should be paid\nfrom a common trust fund managed by the ERC. This has the added advantage of buttressing the\nrequirement that the seconded Humanitarian Coordinator derives authority from, and reports and\nis accountable to, the ERC, rather than the seconding agency.\n5. The logic of the lead agency model is undeniable when one agency is overwhelmingly present. It\nmakes pragmatic sense to harness its infrastructure for the benefit of the system. In the abstract,\nthe lead agency could be considered the closest to a management model, combining elements of\ncontrol, capacity, authority, and clarity about who is in charge. Yet in practice, evidence suggests\nthat it has mostly not been possible for an operational agency to coordinate in the interests\nof overall humanitarian response. In the reality of a decentralised system, lead agencies have\ninsufficient control to compel others to coordinate, and in practice have undertaken insufficient\nconsensus-building efforts to persuade others to coordinate.\n6. If one seeks to mitigate the disadvantages of the lead agency model, the model ceases to\nbe a lead agency model at all. This is because, in essence, the lead agency model revolves\naround the lead agency country director or representative exercising the functions of\nHumanitarian Coordinator. To ensure that there are no vested institutional interests, at the very\nleast the Coordinator should be relieved of responsibilities for day-to-day operations if a lead\nagency is to be successful in terms of performing system-wide coordination. Thus a ‘lead agency\nmodel’ that would be likely to avoid past pitfalls is essentially no different from the model where\nthe Humanitarian Coordinator comes from an operational agency. Furthermore, if there were\neffective personnel rosters and rapid response support teams that could provide coordinators and\nsupport structures in the earliest days of an emergency, the use of the problematic option of\ncarving coordination capacity out of the lead agency infrastructure would no longer be necessary.\n7. Notwithstanding the one disadvantage of the separate function model, the team concluded that\nthere is a strong case in favour of the Humanitarian Coordinator being separate from the\nResident Coordinator. This is not least due to concern at the slow pace at which the pool of\ncompetent Resident Coordinator candidates is being enlarged. It also stems from a recognition of\nthe scale of the challenges faced by humanitarian coordination such as the importance of\nleadership in overcoming the obstacles to coordination within the UN, and the importance of\nadvocacy and negotiating access in settings where governance is weak or absent – all of which\nsuggest that a separate Humanitarian Coordinator charged with full-time coordination would be\nbest placed to coordinate. Where a Resident Coordinator is in place, clear strategies and strong\ncollaboration should mitigate the intellectual and operational confusions.\n8. The team therefore concluded that in order to fulfil the criteria established above, the IASC\nshould review its assumption that the combined Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator\nshould be the default option and instead favour separate Humanitarian Coordinators,\nparticularly in cases of large-scale rapid onset emergencies where territorial control is divided\namong belligerents and where the demands of negotiating access and undertaking advocacy are\nhigh. This should also be the case in peace operations where the Resident Coordinator is the\nDSRSG (elaborated below). Secondments from operational agencies to OCHA that report to the\nERC should be actively sought.\n                                                          \n69\n In Angola, Ramiro Manuel da Silva was able to call on the logistics capabilities of his organisation that contributed to him\nbeing an effective coordinator. In Burundi, one aspect of Kathleen Kravero Kristoffersson’s credibility was her UNICEF\nbackground.\n23Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5: HOW COORDINATION GETS DONE\nA recurring theme of this study is that effective coordination adds value by performing a number of\nkey tasks, as well as offering a range of services and skills for the benefit of the response of host\ngovernments, UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross system and donors. This section presents this\nstudy’s findings on the tasks, services and tools of coordination that have added value to the work of\nthose involved in humanitarian response. It distils some of the ingredients that make such services\nmost helpful, and discusses the associated challenges of providing them. It also considers some of\nthe less successful aspects of humanitarian coordination that require reform.\nThe section begins by focusing on those tasks that this study argues are critical to coordination as an\nintegrating activity, facilitating humanitarian responses that are more than the sum of their individual\nparts. These include analysis, strategy setting, the goals and standards for the response,\norchestrating a division of labour, advocacy – including negotiating access and sustaining a\n70\nframework of consent – and monitoring and evaluating impact. The section then turns to some of the\ntasks and services that facilitate collaboration among agencies and thereby contribute to coordinated\noutcomes: the provision of common services such as security, communications, and common\nlogistics, information systems, and resource mobilisation. The section concludes by looking at the\ntools and structures available to coordinators and their teams.\n5.1 Coordinating Integrated Responses: Tasks and Techniques\n5.1.1 Analysis\nIn the action-oriented culture of humanitarian response, understanding the causes and dynamics of\nthe conflicts in which humanitarian agencies work can seem an optional extra. The IASC list of\n71\nfunctions for strategic coordination does not mention analysis. Donors too show little interest in the\n72\nquality of agencies’ analysis of their environment. Yet analysis is not an optional extra. In the words\nof one interviewee: ‘Offering a compelling vision of what can be achieved based on sound analysis of\ncontext is perhaps the greatest value added ever offered to coordination, provided that it is offered in\na way that people can add to, [and] feel included in.’\nSuch ‘sound analysis of context’ is increasingly acknowledged as vital to humanitarian response.\nOver the last decade, humanitarians have recognised that in contexts where civilian targeting may be\na key strategic aim rather than a consequence of conflict, and where relief goods and infrastructure\nhave been appropriated by belligerents, humanitarian aid can do more harm than good. Ensuring that\nthis is not the case requires carefully considered strategies based on sound political, economic, and\nsocial analysis. Protection strategies also depend on sound analysis. The fact that humanitarians\nhave to preserve the independence of humanitarian action and thus position themselves carefully in\nrelation to political and military strategies – whether of UN peacekeepers, Member States, or warring\nparties – again emphasises the imperative of sound analysis of the context and conduct of\nhumanitarian action (see Section 6 for more on this).\nIn addition to more macro analysis, effective micro-assessment of need requires understanding of the\ncoping strategies that people themselves use to survive, and how such strategies are undermined or\nsupported by the tactics of warring parties or humanitarian agencies. A positive example of this was\nfound in Kosovo, where OCHA’s Humanitarian Vulnerability Assessment initiatives, which draw on the\nexpertise of the appropriate UN and other agencies, have been seen as very useful in guiding the\noverall response.\n                                                          \n70\n Such tasks correlate closely with the IASC’s description of strategic coordination. See IASC (1998a) op. cit.\n71\n A point noted by Duffield, Jones & Lautze (1998) op. cit.\n72\n For example, donor funding ‘technologies’, such as logframes and project cycles, do not require agencies to offer a very\nsophisticated analysis of the causes of humanitarian need to which they propose to respond.\n24Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nGood contextual knowledge, situational analysis and regular monitoring of the environment are critical\n73\nelements of effective security management. Analysis is also a vital part of lesson learning. Across\nthe humanitarian community analysing and capturing lessons from past experiences appears to be\nweak, contributing to the fact that all too many individuals and organisations are left to repeat the\nmistakes of the past and without the benefit of prior knowledge. In the DRC, several NGOs expressed\nthe need for agencies to do more to share their analysis with one another, particularly sharing lessons\nfrom past experiences. For example, in Kosovo, although many agencies deemed the 1999/2000\nwinterisation programme a success, there was little that had been distilled into an analysis about why\nthings had gone well to inform the 2000/2001 winterisation programme.\nHumanitarian Coordinators and their teams have a pivotal role to play in providing and facilitating\npolitical, economic and social analysis at the macro and micro levels – a task that this study suggests\n74\nis rarely done well. As noted above, both Coordinators and members of their staff require strong\nanalytical skills. Yet effective analysis also depends on techniques and systems to gather, share and\nmanage information in order to build up a picture of the context and impact of humanitarian response.\nIn Nairobi, for example, the Humanitarian Analysis Group of the SACB chaired by the UN\nCoordination Unit for Somalia (UNCU) provides a forum for monthly inter-agency discussion of the\n75\nevolving situation among key information collectors. Effective coordination requires this mix of\nskilled personnel and more systematic use of analysis-building techniques.\nValue-added analysis:\n• Is  ‘ahead of the curve’ and considers issues that other agencies are not looking at. A good\nexample is OCHA’s work on energy in the FRY.\n• Draws on analysis and knowledge of local staff and security officers. All case studies suggested\nthis was a rich but neglected source of information and analysis.\n• Requires access to the field. Many interviewees emphasised that this was essential in order to\nproduce the level of information that adds value.\n• Considers factors at global, regional, national and local levels in terms of how they impinge on the\ncauses of conflict and context of humanitarian response.\n76\n• Considers political, economic, social and cultural factors.\n• Knows what is going on, and therefore sheds light on why and how to respond.\n77\n• Offers understanding of the dynamics and motives of those that fight.\n• Draws on locally available researchers, for example, the research of the War Torn Societies\nproject in Somalia involving Somali researchers was found useful.\n• Includes analysis on the processes by which some people win and others lose. For example, a\nnumber of interviewees found the UNCU’s political economy analysis enriched their understanding\nand their strategies.\n• Identifies the obstacles to building peace.\n• Is built and modified from a process of listening to others.\nChallenges\nEffective analysis of a changing context is time-consuming and can represent an investment of\nresources in terms of personnel that seems beyond the means of individual agencies. This highlights\nthe value added where coordination teams can offer such analysis to others.\nConversely, there is a risk that if analysis is seen as the sole preserve of one individual or agency,\nothers can both fail to take responsibility for contributing information and analysis that they acquire in\ntheir daily work, and to use such analysis to guide their action.\nNot all players will have the same analysis. This poses a huge facilitation challenge for coordination\nteams. As discussed below, CAP formulation could offer one opportunity for building system-wide\nanalysis. Joint assessments have also proved a useful tool to forge shared perceptions of problems.\n                                                          \n73\n For extensive detail on this, see Van Brabant, K. (2000) Operational Security Management in Violent Environments (HPN at\nODI : London) Good Practice Review 8.\n74\n This is also borne out by ALNAP’s review of evaluations of humanitarian response, see ALNAP (2001) Humanitarian Action:\nLearning from Evaluation (ODI: London).\n75\n The UNCU is a joint UNDP/OCHA coordination office for Somalia (see Annexe 3).\n76\n For comment on ignoring political analysis and focusing on socioeconomic issues  which leads to inadequate attention to\nprotection issues, see DANIDA (1999) Evaluation of Danish Humanitarian Assistance Volume 6: Great Lakes (Ministry of\nForeign Affairs, Danida: Copenhagen).\n77\n For more information see Le Billon (2000) The Political Economy of War: What Relief Workers Need to Know (HPN at ODI:\nLondon), Network Paper 33.\n25Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5.1.2 Formulating a Strategy and Plan\nHaving a clear strategy and plan to guide the humanitarian response is pivotal to ensuring that the\nmost critical humanitarian needs are met. Yet all too often humanitarian actors in general, and the UN\nin particular, are unable to articulate what they are trying to achieve, or how their particular actions\nrelate to precise goals. This recurrent conclusion was common to past studies, interviews, and case\nstudies. It derives partly from the paucity of humanitarian agencies’ analysis of their environment,\npartly from a lack of a shared vision, and partly from poor management. It signals both a major failing\nof coordination and raises questions about the overall quality and impact of the humanitarian\nresponse. One interviewee summed it up succinctly: ‘For a sustained and principled response,\ncoordination should facilitate a joint vision and strategy, [and] not just share information.’\nFor example, in the DRC many interviewees, including UN officials at the highest level, lamented the\nlack of an overarching strategy and implementation plan for humanitarian action. One coordinator\ndescribed the fact that UN had not defined what it wanted to achieve as ‘the first and major\nweakness’. Another reason to plan was the negative impact on the overall response if planning didn’t\ntake place: ’If you want performance, tasks need to be clearly defined.’ The need to focus on a plan\nand not rely on the inspiration of single individuals was also acknowledged: ‘You shouldn’t bring\npeople together around a person but around a plan.’\nCollected evidence from past studies and interviews suggests that formulating effective strategies for\naction and plans to achieve them requires leadership and vision, and can in return add to the\ncredibility of those facilitating or leading the process.\nEffective strategies:\n• Are based on sound analysis of the political, economic, cultural, and social setting.\n• Focus on tackling problems in an integrated way rather than in mandate sized pieces. The\nstrategic framework in Afghanistan is perhaps one of the most ambitious attempts at this, with its\naim to provide a common framework for planning and monitoring.\n• Offer people a sense of direction.\n• Turn activities into more than the sum of their individual parts.\n78\n• Should focus on specific, measurable targets not goals.\n• Have benchmarks against which progress can be monitored.\n• Focus on providing both humanitarian protection and assistance.\n• Consider how to achieve and sustain access.\n• Include the principles and standards that will inform that approach.\n• Will define how to work with state structures and assess the impact of the humanitarian effort on\nstate structures.\n79\n• Include all players from the outset, even if implementation will include a sequential approach.\n• Emerge from processes that allow participants opportunities for joint analysis and reflection.\n• Address the plight of IDPs.\n• Address relief, rehabilitation and longer term development issues in an appropriate way.\n80\n• Include preparedness and prevention measures.\n• Take into account the security implications of what is proposed.\n• Identify the role for effective political action in pursuit of humanitarian goals.\n•\n Should ideally be approved and adopted by the humanitarian community as a whole.\n                                                          \n78\n Having specific, timebound and measurable targets instead of goals is important to monitoring and accountability. This\nemulates the trend in the development sphere. See Leader, N. (2000a) Negotiating the 'Governance Gap': The UN and\nCapacity-Building in Afghanistan - a  Report for the UN Capacity-Building Task Force.\n79\n See the Praxis Group Ltd (2000) Background Paper Drafted As Preparation for the ECHA DDR Working Group Paper:\n'Harnessing Institutional Capacities in Support of DDR of Former Combatants'.\n80\n This could draw on the work of the UN Interdepartmental Framework for Coordination team – consisting originally of DPA,\nDPKO, OCHA and later UNDP and UNHCR, and now also UNICEF, WFP, WHO and FAO – to support preventive action and to\ndevelop improved mechanisms for early warning, contingency planning and preparedness. Several fact-finding missions have\nbeen taken on behalf of this team to increase the state of preparedness.\n26Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nChallenges\nIt is crucial to articulate strategies that respond to actual needs rather than lists of agency activities.\nUN agencies in particular and humanitarians in general often see problems through the prism of their\nown mandates and therefore fail to link effectively with the actions of others. For instance, despite the\nelaborate efforts of sectoral committees in Somalia to articulate sectoral strategies, the response risks\nbeing shaped more by supply agency than by the demand of the situation.\nThe proliferation of tools across the system – such as UN Development Assistance Frameworks\n(UNDAF) and the Common Country Assessment (CCA), strategic frameworks as well as consolidated\n81\nappeals at country and regional appeals constitute an array of tools for UN Country Teams to adopt.\nAlthough examining the interrelationship of these tools was beyond the scope of this study, it is clearly\na challenge for the UN to be clear about the effectiveness, comparative advantages and links\nbetween these tools.\nHarmonising the planning cycles of different agencies is another challenge. For example, a number of\ninterviewees argued that as the timing of the CAP did not coincide with their agency planning it was\nunhelpful (although other interviewees valued the planning process attached to the CAP).\nThe inclusion – or exclusion – of NGOs and humanitarian actors outside the UN continues to be a\npoint of contention. Non-UN actors are not systematically involved in UN strategy and planning\nprocesses, which certainly weakens coordination and potentially weakens the desired impact of the\nresponse. The Brahimi report’s proposals to form Integrated Mission Task Forces to plan for and\n82\nsupport peace operations composed exclusively of UN agency staff could compound this.\nFinally, it is a challenge to devise plans that can respond to, and anticipate, fast-moving events. The\nSomalia case study offered a good example of this where, having had a mid-term review of the CAP\nfor 2000, the UN had to respond to the emergence of the Transitional National Government (TNG).\nThe result of the UN’s efforts was the ‘First Steps’ document, a strategy for UN aid in response to the\nTNG’s emergence, which was later expanded into a year-long programme that became the kernel of\nthe CAP for 2001.\n5.1.3 Adhering to Standards\nA key element of an integrated and principled response is that all actors agree on the nature and\nscale of the required response, that they work towards shared goals, and that they strive to achieve\nthe same standard of response. As the ICRC’s ‘recipe’ of how to work emphasises, along with a clear\nmoral framework and the use of legal instruments, conducting humanitarian activity in a stable,\n83\npredictable manner is central to fostering respect for humanitarian principles and practice. Striving\nfor shared standards of response is vital to ensure impartiality.\nBoth the Somalia and the DRC cases highlighted the practical significance of striving for consistent\nstandards in humanitarian response in terms of minimising accusations of political favouritism that\ncould have dire implications for the security of aid workers and access to beneficiaries. Yet in both\nSomalia and the DRC, and despite efforts at Nairobi level for Somalia, the team found little evidence\nat the field level of attempts to standardise the response among agencies beyond their expressed\ncommitment to the Sphere standards. (However, in the DRC, NGOs in North Kivu had agreed salary\nscales for local staff, and OCHA proposed to organise a workshop with every provincial inspector to\ndiscuss the technical issues of a national health plan.)\nIn Kosovo, despite a well-funded relief response by a huge range of agencies, almost no attention or\ntraining was given on standards for humanitarian response – even by the HCIC that was well placed\nto encourage initiatives in this area.\n                                                          \n81\n The UNDAF is described as the planning framework for the development operations of the UN at the country level, while the\nCCA is described as a collaborative, country-based process for reviewing and analysing the national development situation as\nthe basis of the UNDAF.\n82\n See SCHR (2000) ‘Briefing on the Brahimi Report’, (SCHR, Geneva).\n83\n See Pasquier, A. (2001) Constructing Legitimacy. (Seminar 'Politics and Humanitarian Aid: Debates, Dilemmas and\nDissension' on 1 February 2001).\n27Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nA number of cases demonstrate the possibility of establishing and using standards. For instance,\nLiberia provides a fascinating attempt to establish a local compliance mechanism – the Programme\nCompliance and Violations Committee (PCVO), set up to monitor the agreed code of conduct among\nagencies. If found in breach of the code, the agency had to stand before the PCVO chaired by the\nHumanitarian Coordinator, donors, two international NGOs and two local NGOs. If violated three\ntimes, the organisation was kicked out of the coordination mechanism.\nAdhering to standards requires:\n• Agreement on the standards.\n• The ability to monitor adherence to the standards.\n• Compliance mechanisms.\nChallenges\nClearly, the primary challenge is the lack of system-wide agreement on what standards should be\nused. Given the absence or weakness of any government structure in terms of setting standards,\nhumanitarians are left to set their own guidelines for action that may vary radically from one situation\nto another. Although the IASC has given support to the Sphere standards by calling on its members to\npromote their use, there is no evidence of universal agreement to standards for all aspects of\nhumanitarian response.\nLack of agreement on standards also affects assessment. In Somalia, dealing with the plethora of\nstandards used by different agencies has been a challenge for both the Food Security Assessment\nUnit and the Health Information System for Somalia.\nThe situation in the DRC offered a compelling example of the complexity of ensuring standards are\nset and adhered to. Indeed, one major humanitarian actor in the DRC argued that that coordination\nwas impossible because humanitarian agencies were so dispersed. The fact that governance across\nthe country was divided – precluding any involvement of the authorities – added an additional\ndimension to the challenge.\nAny discussion of compliance mechanisms begs questions about who has sufficient power or\nlegitimacy to assess compliance. The role of the Tanzanian government and UNHCR in limiting the\nnumber of implementation partners in the Ngara camps in Tanzania offers one example of a\ncoordinating structure with such potential power. The Liberia example above offers another. The\nfuture efforts of the Humanitarian Accountability Project may offer others. At a minimum, the debate\nabout standards raises the hurdle yet higher for humanitarians to present, at the very least, a\nconsistently clear – if not united – view of their work.\n5.1.4 Agreeing/Assigning Division of Labour and Allocating Resources\nThe IASC guidelines require Coordinators to allocate tasks and responsibilities ensuring that they are\nreflected in a strategic plan in accordance with agency mandates. Yet a repeated refrain of studies on\ncoordination is a concern that responses shaped solely by mandates will inevitably result in gaps and\nduplication, and that UN agencies should demonstrate greater commitment towards adopting\nintegrated approaches to complex problems. Coordinators thus have a critical role to orchestrate\ndivisions of labour to produce more integrated approaches that meet all the most urgent needs, not\nsolely those that conform to UN agencies’ mandates.\nThe division of labour is done well where:\n• Coordinators have sufficient legitimacy such that agencies will accept greater direction rather than\nsuggestion. In East Timor, some interviewees argued that rather than making suggestions, the\nCoordinator adopted a fairly directive approach in getting people to agree on what to do. However,\nit was recognised that the Coordinator was concerned to help agencies fulfil their mandate.\n• Agencies pool resources and allow the Coordinator to suggest matching of resources and needs.\nThis was also cited as the case in East Timor.\n• There is follow up to ensure implementation. Interviewees pointed to the importance of follow up\non agreed task allocations. For example, in Somalia the limited capacity of the SACB secretariat to\nfollow up impeded the effectiveness of the agreements, whereas in the health sector the full-time\nHealth Coordinator was able to establish whether agencies had implemented plans – or why not.\n28Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nChallenges\nBesides the obstacle of UN agencies’ expressed resistance to coordination that resembles direction\nor management, the other critical challenge for Coordinators is addressing the gaps and duplications\nthat exist among UN mandates, and the skills of NGOs. As discussed above, without responsibilities\nbeing allocated formally – whether through MoUs or a fundamental restructuring of the system, the\nonus is on individual Coordinators to see that all needs are met. Putting funds in the hands of\nCoordinators, whether small funds to cover gaps, or more radically, establishing a common fund at\ncountry-level to receive all responses to the CAP from which the Coordinator allocates funds to\nrespective agencies, are two options to address this challenge.\n5.1.5 Advocacy\nAdvocacy is frequently described as a vital part of humanitarian action. Certainly, many interviewees\nwere clear that advocacy needed to be done. Yet few gave the impression that they felt responsible\nfor advocacy. Although the IASC tasks the Humanitarian Coordinator with advocating for respect for\nhumanitarian principles, many interviewees implied that advocacy is OCHA’s responsibility.\nSuch discussions frequently gave the impression of advocacy as an end in itself, rather than the\nmeans to an end; that is, a set of influencing tactics or instruments, as critical to operational response\nas a water tank or food parcel. In practice, Humanitarian Coordinators may adopt some advocacy\nmethods – such as negotiating with warring parties or lobbying host governments – while public\neducation campaigns on health, or briefing donors or the media are often part of the daily tasks of\nmany humanitarian agencies. Advocacy is not – and should not be – confined to OCHA or to\nHumanitarian Coordinators.\nThe study found many examples of how advocacy had proved critical to effective humanitarian action,\nand how Coordinators and their teams had played critical roles in coordinating advocacy actions,\nfacilitating others, or acting as a spokesperson with warring parties, governments, donors and the\nmedia.\nAdvocacy is useful to:\n• Press for policy and practice change, for example, in North Kivu, NGOs adopted a common\nposition on taxation demanded by the local authorities.\n• To push belligerents, governments, the UNSC and its members and donors to uphold their\nresponsibilities to respect humanitarian principles. Briefings of the UNSC by the ERC, NGOs and\n84\nOCHA officials were all offered as important examples of advocacy.\n 85\n• To sustain and enlarge the constituency concerned about humanitarian action.\n• To highlight forgotten or neglected emergencies, for example, OCHA’s advocacy on the plight of\nthe Banyamulenge in the DRC.\n• To negotiate access. The efforts of Regional Coordinators in the Great Lakes and the Senior\nHumanitarian Advisor in the DRC were offered as important examples.\n•\n To press for funds, for example, the global launch of the CAPs, or OCHA’s efforts to convene a\ndonors’ meeting on the DRC.\nEffective advocacy requires:\n• Sound analysis of the problem: The OCHA DRC paper for the Geneva donors’ conference in\nNovember 2000 was praised.\n• Clear messages and proposals for action: Recent efforts of the Steering Committee for\nHumanitarian Response on the DRC and the Brahimi report were described as good examples of\nposition papers.\n• Seizing all available opportunities: Interviewees and evidence on the Afghan Support Group\nand the SACB suggests that NGOs are also not making the most of the opportunities of those\ngroupings for advocacy.\n• Readiness to press the difficult issues: This was one of the praised achievements of a former\nHumanitarian Coordinator in Burundi who, through ‘good, friendly, firm but fair relations with the\ngovernment’ was able to tackle the ‘tough issues’ that neither NGOs nor donors were willing or\nable to address.\n                                                          \n84\n For a compelling case of the advocacy changing state interest, see MacFarlane, N. (2000) Politics and Humanitarian Action\n(Thomas J. Watson Institute for International Studies, Providence: Rhode Island) Occasional Paper No. 41.\n85\n For emphasis that it is donors not the public who are suffering fatigue, see Randel & German (2000).\n29Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nChallenges\nWhile welcoming the role that Coordinators can play in advocacy, interviewees warned that fielding\nmedia inquiries was helpful as a service to agencies in general, but not if it is a bid for profile on\nbehalf of one agency.\nThe study team was struck by the muteness of UN agencies towards donors, that is, an apparent\nunwillingness by the UN to criticise donor government policies. Humanitarian agencies, particularly\nthe UN, must better manage the tension between relying on donors for funds, complying with their\nexecutive boards, and undertaking an advocacy agenda towards donors and governments to push\nthem to uphold rights to humanitarian assistance and protection. As one UN interviewee remarked:\n'We shouldn't sell our souls just because someone will give us $1m.’ Efforts to build and strengthen\nthe constituency for humanitarian action, including among citizens and UN Member States, is critical\nto the future of humanitarian action, and UN agencies have a central role to play in this. The\nSecretary-General has been clear on this point: 'Our humanitarian action will only be seen as\n86\nlegitimate if it is universal.' \n5.1.6 Negotiating Access/Securing and Sustaining a Framework of Consent\nProtecting humanitarian space – respecting the rights of civilians caught in conflict to assistance and\nprotection – is the task and fundamental goal of all humanitarians. Nonetheless, the IASC tasks the\nHumanitarian Coordinator in particular with responsibility for negotiating for greater access for\nbeneficiaries to relief and assistance.\nHowever, many interviewees suggested that access negotiation was the prerogative of OCHA,\nalthough UN interviewees stated they also wanted to be included and that their responsibility for\naccess should be recognised. In practice, where OCHA or the Coordinator has been absent, or\nunwilling or unable to negotiate access, others have been forced to fill the vacuum. Examples offered\nincluded cases in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and northern Uganda. The Joint Policy of Operations in\nLiberia in 1996 also serves as an important reminder that arrangements spring up where the UN is\nseen as ineffective.\nIn the DRC, OCHA has played a key role in access negotiations and securing agreement to principles\n(see below), although much of the access negotiation was/is done locally by NGOs. NGOs were\nparticularly grateful to OCHA for using the ‘UN umbrella’ to renegotiate access after NGOs left\noperations in Bunia due to security incidents in 2000. Several interviewees stressed the value of\nOCHA’s approach of establishing Humanitarian Liaison Committees. These committees, formed by\nmembers of the community, were the key interlocutors with whom the UN could engage to negotiate\nsafe access to beneficiaries. As one interviewee termed it: ‘The message [to the committees] is “you\ngive us the heads up on what is happening. We do not want to be surprised and we shall deliver”.’\nThus the committees become a local accountability structure, held responsible by local community\nmembers for whether humanitarian assistance was provided or not. This has mitigated some of the\naccess and security problems encountered by NGOs.\nNegotiation is done well where:\n• It is performed by skilled and experienced people who have strong back-up to provide them with\nbackground analysis and to monitor developments.\n• It is performed for both the benefit of the UN and NGOs, for example, OCHA in Angola, Regional\nCoordinators in the Great Lakes, OCHA in the DRC.\n• There is clarity on principles and there are agreed minima or bottom lines among all those\nnegotiating access to prevent belligerents playing agencies off against one another.\n• Ground rules/principles/minima are well known and disseminated among all staff, for example, the\nGround Rules in Sudan. Broad principles can be the basis of more detailed negotiations, for\nexample, WFP in Somalia used the code of conduct developed by the SACB as the basis of\nnegotiation of principles with local authorities in Baidoa.\n• Agencies have unified positions in-country and internationally, for example in cases where ground\nrules have been broken by belligerents leading to a suspension of humanitarian interventions. In\nsuch situations it is essential that a consistent message is communicated.\n                                                          \n86\n See Annan, K. (2000b) ‘Opening Remarks at the International Peace Academy Symposium on Humanitarian Action,’ New\nYork. mimeo.\n30Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• Donors and governments support the stance of those negotiating access by providing additional\nleverage or undertaking complementary diplomatic and political action. The Technical Committee\n(TC) on humanitarian assistance for Sudan that brings donors together to talk about access,\nhumanitarian principles, communications and security has produced several joint protocol\nagreements signed by the government and warring parties useful to hold the parties to account.\nChallenges\nSecuring agreement among UN agencies on who has principal responsibility for negotiating access is\ncritical. Disagreements on what should be the fundamental principles for such negotiations also\nconstitute a major obstacle to effectively coordinated responses within the UN. How UN staff interpret\ntheir agencies’ mandates can confound essential agreement on basic principles, which in turn can\njeopardise successful access negotiations. For example, it was particularly difficult in both\n87\nAfghanistan and Burundi to agree on a definition of ‘live-saving interventions’.\nNGOs’ views on whether the UN should secure access on behalf of all humanitarian agencies varied:\nthe majority argued that access negotiations was a key role for the UN to carry out on behalf of\nNGOs. Yet some were anxious to maintain their independence in conducting their own access\nnegotiations. As the UN does not have the power to ‘bring NGOs to heel’, it remains a challenge for\nCoordinators and their teams to see that all negotiations and negotiators increase, rather than\njeopardise, respect for humanitarian principles among warring parties and/or local authorities.\n5.1.7 Monitoring Strategy\nAccording to their ToR, Humanitarian Coordinators should monitor and evaluate the overall\nimplementation of the humanitarian strategy and plan to ensure that changing circumstances and\n88\nconstraints are identified and addressed. However, despite the measures taken by the IASC, the\nstudy team found little evidence of strategic monitoring among UN agencies other than the CAP mid-\nterm review. This is evidently linked to weak strategy setting processes and an absence of clear goals\nand benchmarks against which to assess the impact of a response. It is a sign both of weak\nhumanitarian coordination and a more general weakness of humanitarian action that there is so little\n89\ninvestment in assessing impact.\nDespite the lack of positive examples of monitoring the progress and impact of strategies from which\nto draw, interviews and studies provided ideas on how monitoring is critical to effective coordination\nand response.\nEffective monitoring is essential to:\n• Evaluate the positive and negative impact of humanitarian response.\n• Ensure that the response addresses changing circumstances.\n• Assist with context analysis and lesson learning.\n• Useful to provide coordination teams with information that, if recorded and retrievable, allows the\ncoordination function to act as an institutional memory for others. Being able to inform or remind\npeople of what went before becomes particularly important when staff turnover is high. It also\nfacilitates subsequent evaluations of the response, which are important for accountability.\nChallenges\nThe fundamental challenge for monitoring to be truly effective is establishing the benchmarks or\nindicators against which to assess impact. Yet this is frequently the source of debate. In the Sudan,\nfor example, agencies have had great difficulty agreeing upon such indicators.\nMonitoring also requires dedicated resources both to carry out and record findings. In some settings,\neven the most minimal monitoring, that is simple follow up on decisions made in coordination\n90\nmeetings, is thwarted by the lack of capacity.\n                                                          \n87\n For further elaboration on this point, see Toole, D. (2001) ‘Negotiation of Humanitarian Access and Assistance: Observations\nfrom Recent Experience’, Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, Working Paper.\n88\n The 1997 Secretary-General’s Reform Report notes that the IASC agreed that 'simple field-based monitoring systems be\nestablished…with [the] Resident Coordinator setting clear benchmarks and objectives’. The IASC is also looking at the\npossibility of an inter-agency mechanism.\n89\n On the consequences of weak monitoring, see Wiles et al (2000) Independent Evaluation of Expenditure of DEC Kosovo\nAppeal Funds Phases I and II, April 1999–January 2000 Volume I (ODI in association with Valid International: London).\n90\n The UN is not alone in this. For comments on the Red Cross Movement in this regard, see Anema et al (2000) op. cit.\n31Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5.2 Facilitating Collaboration: Tasks and Services\n5.2.1 Security\nFor interviewees, security, logistics, and communications systems all fall under the rubric of common\nservices. All these were described as adding value to individual agency responses and boosting the\nprofile of the coordination structures that offered them.\nSecurity is a key preoccupation of the UN system, as the death toll among humanitarian workers\nrises. To strengthen currently inadequate UN security measures, UN agencies have been pushing for\nstronger centralised resources of skilled people to support agencies on the ground. Yet UN Member\n91\nStates remain resistant to funding additional security measures. This leaves the burden on UN\nagencies who both provide funds and second staff to UNSECOORD, all in a context of donor\npressure on UN agencies for cost-containment.\nThe IASC has a working group dedicated to agreeing measures to improve inter-agency collaboration\non security. Although many interviewees mentioned coordination of security measures, there was little\ndetail on precisely what role the Humanitarian Coordinator should play. Yet many people asserted\nthat poorly coordinated security measures impact negatively on the overall coordination effort, as this\ncorrodes trust and therefore the collaboration that is central to coordination, as well as placing lives in\njeopardy.\nIn Somalia, the SACB literature suggests that collective response to security threats has been one of\n92\nthe major achievements of the coordinating body. However, the focus on security in Nairobi\n93\ncontrasted starkly with reported weak or ad hoc coordination on security matters in Baidoa. In\nKosovo, one of the main security related coordination issues has been the inability of NATO KFOR to\nprovide clear, timely and adequate information to the humanitarian agencies.\nDrawing on interview, case studies, past studies and the IASC Security Task Force, a number of\nimportant ingredients emerge that are useful to increase collaboration among agencies.\nGood security coordination includes:\n• The Coordinator’s team should have a dedicated security capability focused on collecting\ninformation and ensuring that a common security plan is established (and regularly reviewed). This\ncan be used as a basis for providing security analysis and threat assessment. For example,\nagencies in the Northern Caucasus have benefited from an office dedicated to security managed\nby UNSECOORD, which has become a resource for the humanitarian community at large.\n• A common security plan which includes common conditions/criteria for evacuation/relocation.\n• A common security communications channel for operational and other partners in humanitarian\naction.\n• The commitment by all humanitarians to provide information to security focal point(s) in order to\nfacilitate mapping incidents, common training, and establishing minimum security standards. For\nexample, the UNCU for Somalia aims to create an incidents’ database with the UN Chief Security\nAdvisor.\n•\n Regular consultation with NGOs and the Red Cross Movement.\n• Open and transparent discussion on arrangements for staff security.\n• Clarification by the UN on what protection and evacuation arrangements can be provided to non-\n94\nUN agencies.\n•\n The development of a protocol for the use of armed guards, as done in for example, in the\nNorthern Caucasus and Sierra Leone.\n• Building relationships with the local communities in order that they use whatever influence they\nhave over armed groups who might threaten the provision of humanitarian assistance.\n                                                          \n91\n In December ACABQ refused 90% of what was requested to strengthen measures to provide field security. It pressed instead\nfor central management of existing resources.\n92\n See the SACB’s security guidelines document of May 1999. This has principally involved banning activity in areas where\nthere have been incidents. However, it is not clear how the decisions are made about when to lift bans, and recent experience\nsuggests agency resolve to abide by such bans is fracturing.\n93\n At the time of the study, a zonal security officer had just been placed in Baidoa focused explicitly on improving inter-agency\ncoordination on security.\n94\n Sommers (2000) highlights that successful management of security information took place only after circumventing UN\nregulations aimed at preventing UN agencies from sharing information and coordinating security with NGOs.\n32Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nChallenges\nOne of the key challenges to coordinated security measures is resolving the disputes around who\nshould be party to them. For example, in some instances OCHA has been excluded from field-level\nsecurity management teams by other members of the UN Country Team. Such exclusive habits are\nnot conducive to coordination, whether on security or other matters.\nThese exclusive habits are also a point of contention with NGOs. NGOs may have different thresholds\nfor evacuation and the UN might pull out when others remain. Yet how this is done is crucial. For\nexample, in Burundi in 1999, in addition to their withdrawal, UN agencies withdrew the radios that\nthey had been providing to NGOs. Such action can fatally undermine any sense of community and\ncollegiality. The IASC Security Task Force, due to finish its work in mid-2001, will hopefully address\nsome of these UN–NGO tensions.\n5.2.2 Logistics\nAll the evidence for this study suggests coordination structures that provide or facilitate access to\nlogistics support are almost invariably valued. This was the foundation for the valued role of the\nCoordinator in East Timor in matching available logistics resources with needs, and supporting WFP’s\nvital logistics role. In the DRC, OCHA’s role in hiring planes to facilitate the response to crisis in\nKisangani was also much appreciated. It was also at the heart of a highly collaborative relationship\nbetween WFP and UNHCR in the Great Lakes in 1996, when they temporarily pooled personnel and\n95\nequipment in Movement Control Centres (MOVCONs).\nAlthough the IASC has endorsed WFP’s role in providing logistics, individual agencies retain the\n96\nprerogative to make their own arrangements. However, the current IASC initiative to create an inter-\nagency capacity for activating a United Nations Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC) at the onset of a large-\nscale emergency is a sign of inter-agency enthusiasm for joint approaches on this matter. The UNJLC\nproposal – being coordinated by WFP – builds on the efforts to create a UNJLC during the Eastern\nZaire crisis in 1996, the Somalia/Kenya flooding in 1998, the Kosovo operation, East Timor in 1999,\nand the flooding in Mozambique in 2000. The plan is to establish a UNJLC – matched to the demand\nof the situation – within the 'operational structure’ of the Humanitarian Coordinator, to which agencies\nmight second staff. WFP is working on the required ‘flyaway’ packages required to have UNJLC\ncapability readily available.\nImportant elements of logistics coordination include:\n• The willingness of agencies or Coordinators to put resources and capabilities at the service of\nothers.\n• An agreed sets of procedures for joint logistics operations.\nChallenges\nAs with other coordination services, the key to usefulness of joint logistics arrangements is that they\nadd value. In the words of one UN agency: ‘Having central services is fine provided they are fast\nenough.’ Where common services are significantly slower than agencies’ own arrangements, their\nattractiveness diminishes. This will also be the challenge for the proposed UNJLCs.\n5.2.3 Additional Common Services\nBesides assistance in security and logistics, there were a number of other useful services provided by\ncoordination structures mentioned in interviews and studies. One interviewee captured this quid pro\nquo element of coordination, highlighting how valuable such services are where Coordinators have to\nforge consensus among agencies: ‘If you can put up VHF communications, you‘ll be given a whole lot\nmore information.’\n97\nThere was little mention of common houses and offices, although this has come up in past studies.\n                                                          \n95\n UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998) op. cit.\n96\n IASC (1998b) ‘Pamphlet on Humanitarian Coordinators Annex III’, November.\n97\n UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP (1998) op. cit., p.14.\n33Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nEvidence suggested that additional useful services include:\n• Common communication facilities such as those provided between 1994 and 1996 by UNHCR in\nthe Goma camps, and the Radio Room in Rwanda 1994. By contrast in 2000 in the DRC, many\nNGOs and the Red Cross were frustrated by the absence of a shared communication system.\n• Facilitating visas and laissez-passer.\n• Providing pigeonholes, meeting space, GIS/database and mapping services, NGO liaison, and a\nfront desk service. The HCIC in Kosovo is a good example here.\n• Helping new UN and NGOs acclimatise through induction services (although this is partly to\ncompensate for the poor levels of preparation and induction of new staff before they arrive in the\nfield).\n• Providing training sessions, for example, in the DRC, OCHA organised training sessions on food\nsecurity and flood response that NGOs found useful.\n5.2.4 Resource Mobilisation\nAlthough preoccupation with funding was never far below the surface in many interviews, there was\nvery little said by interviewees about the role of field-level coordination in mobilising resources.\nHowever, if decentralisation of funding decisions emerges as an enduring trend among donors, this\ncould change. Indeed, the team encountered a number of examples of field-level Coordinators\ninvolved in resource mobilisation. In Kosovo, the Humanitarian Coordinator and OCHA worked to\nmobilise funding for 2000/2001 winter preparedness activities. The Resident/Humanitarian\nCoordinator for Somalia was engaged in regular and sustained advocacy at local and international\nlevels on Somalia’s needs and the proposed responses to support the Somali people. In the DRC,\nmany interviewees spoke of the importance of a recent donor conference for which OCHA had\nprepared a paper on behalf of the UN Country Team and the humanitarian community.\nOn the basis of the evidence before the team, resource mobilisation is done well where:\n• The Coordinator does not have responsibility for a particular agency’s operations; this helps avoid\nconflict of interest. In Angola, the involvement of UCAH in demobilisation led to some seeing\nUCAH as a competitor for resources rather than an impartial fundraiser.\n• Efforts are prepared jointly. For example, in Burundi the humanitarian community came together to\ncreate a reconstruction plan that was discussed at a Brussels pledging conference on 6 December\n2000.\n• Where analysis of the causes and consequences of humanitarian suffering are clearly presented\nalong with clear proposals for international action.\n• Agencies on the ground engage donors at local and international level.\n• Where efforts are directed at common funds and system-wide responses rather than agency\ninterests.\n5.2.5 Information (gathering, analysis, synthesis and dissemination)\nThere is universal consensus that information sharing is the sine qua non of coordination activity. The\ncapacity to filter, analyse, synthesise and present information into digestible and easily used form is a\nvaluable service. Timely and effective response to humanitarian emergencies depends on accurate\ninformation about needs. Information also underpins analysis, the value of which has already been\ndiscussed.\nA common theme among interviewees was the high value placed on information services that are\nprovided in an equal way for the benefit of the entire humanitarian community rather than solely for\nthe UN or NGOs. This was one of the stated strengths of the HCIC in Kosovo and the Integrated\nOperations Centre of UNREO in Rwanda in 1994, and one of the striking weaknesses of information\nexchange in the DRC where some UN agencies were resistant to sharing information with NGOs. It is\nalso crucial that consolidated information is distributed widely, particularly to those that provided it.\nThe team received frequent complaints, particularly from international NGOs, that information\nprovided ‘disappeared into a black hole and was never seen again’.\n34Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nKey elements of useful information provision include:\n• Maps, graphs and matrixes of who is doing what, where, as well as where local needs are. This\nwas the most cited source of useful information for programme planning. This sort of information\nis therefore essential for a Coordinator to have in his/her toolkit. However, the degree of\nsophistication of this information may differ between what is useful for decision-making and what\nis useful for reporting. In Burundi and Angola, mapping the whereabouts of IDPs gave\npractitioners a bigger picture as well as the basis for an advocacy tool to be used with the donors;\nit also built the credibility and influence of the Coordinator.\n• Data on population needs that is disaggregated by sex and age to identify the specific needs of\nwomen, men, children and the elderly.\n• Up-to-date directories of contacts. For example, a directory of humanitarian and development\ncontacts has been drawn up by OCHA Georgia.\n• Translation of the local press was described as useful in Indonesia. This is also key in security\nplanning.\n• Archive materials, for example, background documents on particular geographic areas, are also\nhelpful. Several interviewees suggested this was a neglected but important source of information.\n• Information on food security strategies at household and regional level provided by the Food\nSecurity Assessment Unit (FSAU) for Somalia enabled WFP to better target its assistance.\nEstablished in 1994, the FSAU now has monitors across Somalia to provide information on the\nagricultural and food availability situation in the country.\n• Geographic information systems (GIS) are powerful tools for tracking needs and the impact of\naction plans. The HCIC in Kosovo produced an atlas available publicly on their website, on CD-\n98\nROMs, and in hard copy.\n• Data on donors’ policies and funding.\n• Pigeonholes and mailboxes allow easy dissemination of information for agencies in close\ngeographical proximity to one another. This can be complemented by websites and CD ROMs\nwhere this is not the case. Interviewees said this facilitates communication with headquarters.\n• Agency handbooks and key documents available on CD ROMS that are regularly updated.\n• The Integrated Regional Information Network’s (IRINs) ability to provide a short synthesis of\nregional activities, trends and events was universally welcomed.\nChallenges\nNational and local authorities have a key role to play in gathering and providing information on the\nneeds of the population and are an important source on which humanitarian agencies can draw. One\n99\nof the challenges is to build the capacity of such national and local authorities where they exist.\nMinimising the duplication in data gathering and maximising its accessibility to potential users is also\ncrucial. This was one of the major challenges described in Somalia. For instance, UNICEF has some\nof the best data on the socioeconomic situation across the country but this is used for its own\npurposes. In the same vein, when the UN Development Office for Somalia disbanded in 1999 few\nknew that it had been collecting data for five to six years; the information was not well-archived and\ntherefore difficult to retrieve.\nOne of the challenges that accompany new information technology tools is having staff available to\noperate them. This was a particular problem that beset the Health Information System (HIS) project\nfor Somalia. After five years, the system is not up and running. Although data exists, it has not been\ninput effectively. The project has also suffered from lack of funding and leadership. In the field,\nalthough agency staff are keen to use the HIS, the lack of training on the incipient system is a source\nof frustration.\nIn many settings, Coordinators have to solve the problem of how to gather and disseminate politically\nsensitive information and analysis. The solution of NGOs in the DRC was to hold small, informal\ngatherings which brought Congolese and international staff together to share information and analysis\non the political and military situation. Participating agencies felt this was invaluable.\n                                                          \n98\n HCIC combined GIS data produced by such sources as the Western European Satellite Centre, the Geneva Centre for\nHumanitarian Demining, KFOR, the Yugoslav Institute of Statistics, and the International Management Group.\n99\n This recurs as a recommendation of the Special Coordinator on Internal Displacement.\n35Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nWhat emerges from all this is the challenge of finding staff who have specific skills in filtering,\nanalysing, synthesising and presenting information. A good example of this is IRIN, which relies on\nteams that include professional journalists who are used to digesting a large volume of material\nalongside humanitarian workers who maintain the humanitarian perspective and angle of IRIN’s work.\nA further challenge is ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of staff on a coordination team to\nmeet information needs. When humanitarian actors have limited commitment or capability to share\ninformation, coordination structures have to be more proactive in information gathering.\nOverall, for all the emphasis placed on information, the study team came away with a sense that there\nis rarely discussion of what kind of information people need to make good decisions, and little\ndiscussion between providers and consumers about what is wanted. As a result, those given\nresponsibilities to compile information have to work this out for themselves, so reinventing the wheel.\nOne interviewee summed this up: ’I am fed up with the little initiatives on information here and there.\n100\nWhat do we want to collect and for what?’ The challenge is to secure system-wide agreement on\nguidelines for basic data collection and dissemination.\n5.1.9 Meetings\nMeetings are the most obvious tool by which information is gathered and shared. Meetings are also\nuseful for team building, problem solving and building networks.\nIn the DRC, many NGO interviewees lamented that UN-convened meetings did not provide real\nopportunity to analyse the situation or share lessons. However, NGOs in particular stressed that in\nKinshasa, OCHA-convened meetings offered useful networking opportunities. For Somalia, although\nmany value the SACB for bringing people together, many interviewees stressed the importance of\ntransparency and honesty from participants, implying that this is currently lacking.\nFactors that determine the usefulness of meetings include:\n•\n Inclusive composition: UN Country Team meetings that include all IASC members was cited as\na strong point of coordination in Belgrade for FRY, excluding Kosovo. In the DRC and Somalia,\nexclusion of local or international NGOs from key meetings was a sore point for some\ninterviewees.\n• The comportment of participants: Commitment, transparency, and respectfulness from all\nparticipants is required. The team was struck that few meetings included introductions.\n101\n• Good preparation and minuting: Objectives and outcomes should be defined.\n• Sensitivity to translation requirements: In several meetings attended by the team, there was\nlittle sensitivity towards those participants who were working in a second or third language, and\ntheir possible translation needs.\n• Effective follow up: The degree of follow up outside meetings can depend on resources. For\nSomalia, the SACB Secretariat argued that its own limited capacity impaired follow up on\ndecisions. Perhaps the most critical case was an agreement to strengthen coordination in the field\nthat had simply slipped out of sight through lack of follow up.\n• Skilful and sensitive chairing that can balance consultation and action: UN Country Team\nmeetings in Belgrade demonstrated how effective chairs can ‘keep the ball rolling.’ Effective chairs\ncan also use meetings as an accountability mechanism, using the public arena to remind others of\nprior commitments in meetings, mandates or MoUs. This role was played to good effect by the\nHealth Coordinator in the SACB.\n• Making regular checks on the composition and frequency of the meeting: This will need to be\ndone in order to ensure that composition and frequency are still appropriate, as the context of the\nhumanitarian response changes. Otherwise meetings will suffer from dwindling attendance and/or\nattendance by decreasingly less senior personnel.\nChallenges\nParticipation is a vexing question. Those coordination structures that mirror IASC membership –\nincluding UN agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross Movement – still exclude donors and local NGOs.\nEast Timor, the DRC and Somalia are all examples where the exclusion of local NGOs – whether for\n102\nreasons of security or translation – has proved contentious.\n                                                          \n100\n This will be challenges for the Geographic Information Systems Team (GIST) and the Structured Humanitarian Assistance\nReporting (SHAPE) initiative, both inter-agency information management initiatives.\n101\n The Handbooks of UNHCR and UNDAC handbook provide useful tips on effective meetings.\n36Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe question of donor participation is also a thorny one. For instance, in the Somalia case study,\ninterviewees argued that donors are central to the SACB. However, while some interviewees argued\nthat donors’ involvement in meetings acts as a compliance mechanism and ensures that plans are\nimplemented, others suggested that donor presence encouraged grandstanding, and that it risked\npoliticisation of humanitarian decisions.\nPolitical sensitivities and security concerns affect participation and also agendas. In the eastern DRC,\nfor example, the participation of politically partisan local NGOs in information sharing meetings has\ninhibited open communication. In Kinshasa, to demonstrate their impartiality and neutrality, agencies\nhave to be sure that no political information is shared at public meetings or in minutes or bulletins for\nfear of provoking the government’s suspicions.\nThe challenge to ensure that there is an optimal level of structured interaction and that the right\nnumber of meetings takes place is a challenge that is emblematic of coordination in general. Regular,\nwell-run meetings that stick to a set format and meet felt needs of the participants to share information\nand agree actions are valuable. Yet meetings that are convened for the sake of it are not. For\ninstance, in the Somalia case, it seemed that the regime of meetings in Nairobi proceed with minimal\napparent regard for the impact of such activity on the ground. However, in Baidoa, prior to the\ndeployment of a UNCU field coordination officer in December 2000, the lack of systematic exchange\nbetween agencies on issues that affected them all appeared to risk duplication and gaps in response,\nas well as increasing security risks as a result of varying interactions with local communities.\n5.3 Tools and Structures\n5.3.1 The Consolidated Appeals Process\nSince its inception in 1992, there have been continuous efforts to improve the CAP as a process and\nas a tool. There is evidence of increasing engagement by donors and others in using the CAP as a\nstrategic coordination tool. However, on the basis of the evidence gathered by the study team it is\nclear there is still little uniformity in how this is done, what or whom it includes, and how it is used.\nIndeed, the impression from interviewees was that the CAP remains largely a public relations exercise\nthat produces little integrated planning or prioritisation and gives donors the freedom to cherry pick or\nignore it. This despite the fact that, globally, the CAP provides one of the only tools that enables\ncomparison of international responses to humanitarian need and is therefore potentially very useful.\nIn the DRC, views were overwhelmingly negative. NGOs were not aware of having been asked to\nparticipate. Many people commented that there was no substantive consultative process behind the\ndocument; neither could anyone give a clear view of how the CAP related to planning commissions\nthat had been established in North and South Kivu. In Somalia the key tensions surrounded getting\nbuy-in from the donors and NGOs in the SACB for a UN process and tool. More positively, in Kosovo,\nas the CAP was a regional one for South East Europe, it provided one of the few fora for inter-agency\ndiscussion at the regional level.\nHowever, it is not clear to participants that regional CAPs always add value, particularly given the\nopportunity costs in their formulation. For example, experience in preparing the CAP for the Great\nLakes region was complicated by five agencies defining regions differently.\nAt its worst, preparing the CAP is more oriented to estimating likely donor response than reliable\nassessment of humanitarian need. One interviewee summed up the widely-held view among the rest:\n‘CAP is a major distraction from the real work. It is donor driven and you write down what you think\ndonors want to hear. It doesn’t reflect reality and doesn’t necessarily secure financing.’ UN agencies\nappear to go through the motions to please the donors. NGO participation varies.\nDonors too show a mixed response. Some argue that the CAP has little relevance to their funding\ndecisions. However, others have used the CAP as a framework for planning, as a reference point for\ndialogue with other actors, as a factor in their funding decisions, or as a decisive trigger for the\n103\nallocation of resources.\n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n102\n At the time of the study, the NGO Consultative Committee for Somalia in Nairobi was strengthening local NGO involvement\nby restructuring its Steering Committee from an ad hoc grouping of international NGO representatives to include one local and\none international NGO from each district in Somalia.\n103\n See the Common Observations of the First Donor Retreat on the CAP, Montreux, Switzerland.\n37Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nAlthough it is not clear to what extent the quality of the analysis and programmes in the CAP is a key\ndeterminant of its success as a fundraising tool, the study team concluded that the CAP could add\nvalue to the humanitarian effort by placing greater emphasis on the process of analysis and planning.\nAs one interviewee pointed out: ’The good thing about the CAP is that it forces agencies to sit and\nconceptualise together through joint assessment and then mapping out the strategy.’\nThe CAP could therefore provide an opportunity to do three things currently neglected in many\ncoordination structures and settings: (i) engage in analysis of the environment, essential for security\nand strategy setting, (ii) gather information about how the aid effort is impacting on the situation\npositively or negatively, and (iii) be the basis of inter-agency advocacy on the plight of people in any\ngiven situation. For this to happen, the CAP process needs to become an effective forum for\noverworked field workers to analyse and plan in way that is clearly beneficial to them. OCHA could\nplay an important role in providing inputs of analysis to stimulate thought and debate.\nThis study suggests measures to make the CAP more effective include:\n• Make the exercise more evidently useful to field staff as an opportunity for them to analyse and\nplan. As one interviewee said ‘It does make the UN talk to each other which is no bad thing, but it\nis negative [in] that it gets people to come from headquarters rather than the field.’\n• Ensure that the process is supported by effective facilitation and analysis so that participants feel\nthe process adds value to their work.\n• Require Coordinators to actively seek NGO and Red Cross Movement involvement in the analysis\nprocess, if not the fundraising strategy. The credibility of the plan and the degree to which NGOs\nwant to be associated with the UN are two factors that will determine NGO interest in the CAP\ndocument as a fundraising strategy. UN political and military actors and analysts should also be\ninvolved in the analysis and strategy-setting process, if not the strategy.\n• Turn the CAP into a valuable opportunity for planning operational response and advocacy\nstrategies (beyond the increasingly elaborate efforts around the CAP launch).\n• Improve the accuracy and transparency of the CAP’s assessment of target beneficiaries in order to\nincrease its use as an advocacy tool for assessing and comparing international responses to\n104\nhumanitarian need.\n• Encourage the UN system to give greater authority and legitimacy to a neutral Coordinator to\nbetter enable him/her to facilitate and ultimately perform prioritisation.\n5.3.2 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)\nPast studies and interviewees pointed to the value of MoUs to counter the tendency to leave UN\nCountry Teams and individuals to reinvent the wheel and negotiate new relationships at field level. At\n105\na minimum, they indicate a predisposition towards collaboration. They can also serve as a useful\naccountability tool.\nInterviewees were divided on the level of detail that is helpful in an MoU. Some suggested that broad\nframeworks where specific interpretation of language can be interpreted in a particular context are\nmost useful. For others, this left too much to interpretation. Judging from the documents from the\nIASC and ECHA regarding divisions of labour on IDPs and ECHA respectively, these processes fall\ninto the latter camp: in a time-honoured formula, all the difficult decisions about divisions of labour\nhave been devolved to task forces in the field.\nIf MoUs are to be useful, it is critical that Coordinators and their staff are aware of all the relevant\nMoUs, their contents, and their responsibility to honour them. This in turn depends on effective\ninduction and briefing of new staff, as well as effective dissemination to existing staff. One interviewee\nsuggested that OCHA field units keep and provide all MoUs as a service.\n                                                          \n104\n For discussion of the challenges of assessing needs and recommendations and agreeing shared assessment\nmethodologies among IASC members see Ockwell, R. (1999) ‘Full Report of the Thematic Evaluation of Recurring Challenges\nin the Provision of Food Assistance in Complex Emergencies’ (Office of Evaluation, World Food Programme).\n105\n For example, IASC Post-Conflict Reintegration Report; also WFP, UNHCR Tripartite report, op. cit.\n38Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5.3.3 Sectoral Coordination\nAs this study’s ToR suggest, sectoral coordination is a critical aspect of coordination. As one NGO\ntermed it, ‘Humanitarian coordination is based on the foundation of sectoral coordination’. This\nfoundation can be a strong one. By its nature, the focus of sectoral coordination is narrowly defined\nwhich offers greater clarity about what needs to be done. Coordination responsibilities are frequently\nallocated on the basis of technical skills or mandates. Participants often share technical skills, which\nfocuses debates and decisions around technical matters. Greater proximity to the beneficiaries also\nfocuses efforts.\nThat said, coordination at the sectoral level is not immune to some of the difficulties encountered in\ncoordination in general. Sectoral coordination can impose burdens that outweigh its benefits, for\ninstance, when the number of coordination bodies proliferates, and individuals and agencies with\ncoordination and operational responsibilities find themselves struggling with double workloads. As one\nUN interviewee commented, ‘Sectoral coordination can help focus things by focusing on specific\ndetails. But it can become doing nothing other than coordination.’\nFurthermore, allocating coordination responsibilities can prove contentious even at sectoral level,\nparticularly when no agency – whether the UN or otherwise – has clear technical expertise or\nmandated responsibility for a sector. Allocating responsibility for shelter in the early days of the\nresponse in East Timor is a case in point. In both east and west DRC, the already ad hoc efforts of\ncoordination in several sectors have been hampered by disputes between agencies about\ncoordination and implementation responsibilities. A staff member of one of these agencies described\nthemselves at being ‘at war’ with another UN agency.\nBoth donors and agencies can resist Coordinators’ efforts to allocate sectoral responsibilities. There\nshould be more work at central level to build in more predictability around allocating sectoral\nresponsibilities in order to relieve Coordinators from having to reinvent the wheel at every turn.\nSectoral coordination works well where:\n• Strategies at the sectoral level are linked to fulfilling the overall strategy guiding the response.\nSectoral coordination is weakened by the absence of clear goals for the overall humanitarian\nresponse and the sector.\n• Full-time Coordinators are appointed at the sectoral level who are technically competent, for\nexample, UNHCR’s appointment of high-calibre technical Coordinators in the health, water, food,\nsite planning, logistics, security, communications and community services sectors in all its sub-\n106\noffices in the Great Lakes in 1994.\n• Coordinators are prepared to ‘shame and blame‘ others into upholding their undertakings, thereby\nacting as a monitoring and enforcement mechanism. This was true of the health sectoral\ncommittee of the SACB. The UNMIK Mine Action Coordination Centre in Pristina is also an\nexample where tight coordination was exerted, with good collaboration from donors.\n• It is supported by field units that collect and disseminate information, advise on strategies, and act\nas focal points where thoughts on the issue can circulate. For example, FAO’s field units, now\n107\npresent in 17 countries.\n• It does not preclude focus on cross-cutting issues such as human rights or protection – a criticism\nthat interviewees levelled at coordination in the early days of the East Timor response in 1999.\nSeveral interviewees suggested that complementing sectoral coordination with provincial or\nregional focal points would support this.\n5.3.4 Regional Coordination\nIn all three case studies, interviewees repeatedly stressed the importance of regional coordination. As\none UN interviewee commented: ‘It is critical for the UN to get better at this given that the problems\nwe address do not stay within borders.’ Many interviewees spoke of the value of having a regional\nperspective on the causes and consequences of conflict and humanitarian suffering.\n                                                          \n106\n Borton, J. (1996) op. cit.\n107\n The seed money that has been provided by OCHA for some of these units e.g. in Timor and Mozambique, was welcomed.\n39Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nIn the DRC, the regional structures of some agencies have, on occasion, compensated for weak\nsupport from headquarters and have offered invaluable logistics or administrative support. Yet on\nother occasions, these same structures have duplicated efforts or requirements from headquarters.\nThere was even stronger criticism of some regional offices for engaging in analysis of belligerents’\nstrategies without full awareness of the potential dangers this posed for UN colleagues in the country\nitself.\nThe UNCU for Somalia has focused on strengthening regional connections, particularly with Kenya\nand Ethiopia, which has led to the adoption of a regional security plan and increased information\nsharing. A regional exercise to stimulate pastoral networks has also been hugely beneficial for all\nparticipants. Both these positive examples highlight the added value of regional analysis and strategy.\nIn relation to Kosovo, there appeared to be considerable cross-border coordination over the sensitive\nPresovo region in Southern Serbia, particularly between the Humanitarian Coordinators in Pristina\nand Belgrade. The fact that both Humanitarian Coordinators had regional envoy roles within their\nrespective organisations also fostered regional perspectives. However, it was not clear whether there\nwere adequate coordination structures in place in order to build and maintain a comprehensive\nregional analysis.\nInevitably, the recurring theme in discussion of regional coordination is how do Coordinators and\nstructures at regional level relate to Coordinators and coordination structures in the countries within\n108\nthat region. It is not clear that additional Coordinators present the optimum model for to achieving\nregional coordination. For example, the designation of a Regional Coordinator for the Horn of Africa\nwas criticised by a number of people, notwithstanding the calibre of the candidate in the job. The\nposition was described as an ad hoc structure that was devised with little concern for how it would\nrelate to other Coordinators in the region; it was perceived to be responsible for retarding incipient\nattempts at regional coordination initiated by Coordinators across the region.\nMany argued that regional coordination can be best achieved by country coordination structures\ncoming together on a regular basis and establishing a flow of information and analysis between them.\nThis is supported by OCHA’s experience in the Great Lakes, where its efforts to bring Humanitarian\nAffairs Officers together every three months received high praise. This practice is supported by\n109\nrecommendations in the IASC’s Reference Group on Post-Conflict Reintegration.\nFor regional coordination to be successful, there needs to be:\n• Clarity in the division of labour and reporting lines among Coordinators.\n• Structures that offer a regional overview for the benefit of those in country, and facilitate analysis at\nthe regional level.\n• Skilled and experienced Regional Coordinators who provide leadership and advice to Coordinators\nat country level. The negotiation of access in the DRC, and facilitation of an inter-agency position\non regroupement in Burundi, were both cited as hugely valuable contributions by the Great Lakes\nRegional Coordinator in 1996/7.\n• Complementarity between the tasks performed by Regional Coordinators and Coordinators at\ncountry level.\n• Strong collaboration between all Coordinators in a region. In Rwanda in 1994 during the refugee\noutflux, separation of coordination jurisdictions between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ Rwanda was\n110\ndescribed as ‘perhaps the greatest weakness of the coordination arrangements’.\n• Adequate funding to bring people together regularly at regional level.\n                                                          \n108\n See Duffield, Jones & Lautze (1998) on the strains between country and regional coordinators.\n109\nIn its Final Report of 14 August 2000, it recommends regional approaches by conducting UN Country Team field visits across\nborders to refugee camps, organising regional meetings and the support of headquarters  'to ensure that regional initiatives are\nnot thwarted by bureaucratic or mandate obstacles.’  See IASC (2000) op.cit.\n110\n See Borton, J. (1996) op. cit.\n40Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5.3.5 The Inter-Agency Standing Committee\nThe IASC is the mechanism through which field structures are put in place. Its broad membership –\nthat is, its inclusion of NGOs and the Red Cross Movement – is seen as its most important feature. It\nis widely praised for providing a forum for regular inter-agency interaction which, according to some,\nhas fostered collaborative spirit. Yet this broad membership is also the subject of criticism, reflecting\nthe ambivalence that characterises much discussion of the IASC. Although participants cite\nimprovements in the IASC over time, frustrations remain.\nIt seems that within the IASC there is a preoccupation with inclusion rather than representation.\nSeveral interviewees remarked that ‘Nobody wants to be left out.’ In a body that relies on consensus,\ndecision-making is protracted and difficult issues get dodged. One reason for this is that all\nparticipants report to different boards, resulting in weak buy-in and accountability. Yet it cannot be\nhelped by the organisation of the agenda of meetings: participants still express concerns that the\nmeeting agendas are overloaded and issues are not effectively clustered together. As a result, much\nof the substantive work gets done in the corridors rather than at the meetings.\nAlthough the Secretary-General’s proposal to establish an IASC steering committee – in order to\nachieve a more dynamic and focused body – was formally rejected by the IASC, a de facto steering\ngroup has emerged through the informal but regular consultations among the heads of OCHA,\nUNCHR, UNICEF and WFP. (Hitherto, this was one of the all too rare all female groupings in the UN.)\nAlthough this is said to be effective by some of those included in it, it excludes those that are said to\nmake the IASC unique – that is, NGOs and the Red Cross Movement.\nAll of this has a direct bearing on decision-making over decisions about field coordination structures.\nSuch decisions appear to be characterised by protracted discussion and debate among UN agencies,\nmuch of it taking place outside the IASC meetings and thus minimising the role of non-UN members\nin agreeing such arrangements. Furthermore, the process appears heavily oriented to\naccommodating the preferences and politics of the major UN operational agencies rather than solely\nfocusing on the demands of the situation on the ground. As Resident Coordinators are increasingly\ndesignated through the UN Development Group (UNDG), the emphasis on the combined\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator model further intensifies the exclusion of non-UN members of the\nIASC on humanitarian coordination decisions. Where Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators are also\nbeing designated SRSG – such as in Sierra Leone – and the Humanitarian Coordinator is thus also\nresponsible for the political and military strategy of the UN, this exclusion is perhaps all the more\nsignificant (see Section 6 for discussion of the problematic aspects of this).\nThe weak links between staff in the field and those in headquarters also impinge on the IASC’s\ndecision-making and effectiveness. Doubts were expressed about the IASC’s responsiveness to\ncoordination difficulties on the ground. (On this point, the team was struck by the size and seniority of\nthe Inter-Agency Mission that visited the DRC in December 2000 in order to resolve coordination\ndifficulties. However, this did not appear to be part of a systematic process of monitoring of all\nhumanitarian coordination structures and making any necessary changes.)\nSignificantly, in the field there is little awareness of the IASC's role or sense that the field can make\nclaims on the time of the IASC. Although Humanitarian Coordinators may be invited to attend the\nIASC when their countries are being discussed, the process of formulating a policy on regroupement\nin Burundi was one of the rare occasions where IASC-wide policy was generated in the field and only\nafterwards sent to New York.\nIt is apparent that much could be done to improve communication in both directions. The IASC needs\nto improve its monitoring. Humanitarian Coordinators and their teams have a key role to play in\nensuring more systematic dissemination and implementation of key IASC initiatives and statements,\nas well as feeding back to the appropriate part of the IASC on key issues which need debate and a\npolicy view. Ensuring that the IASC is systematically replicated at the field level – a point that has\nbeen recommended many times but still does not always happen – is another aspect to this.\n41Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n111\nHowever, studies and interviewees alike perceived the potential of the IASC. The words of one UN\ninterviewee sum this up well: ‘OCHA has in its hand a fantastic tool. Why doesn’t it use it? Why not try\nto make it the voice of the humanitarian community?’ Yet, as discussed above and below, advocacy,\nand OCHA’s role in it leaves much room for improvement. Given the advocacy experience and\nexpertise that resides among non-UN members of the IASC, measures that minimise their role in the\nIASC further jeopardise the IASC’s potential influence and impact.\nThus for this study, the key areas for improvement are:\n1. More focus on the situation's demands in decision-making over the appointments of Coordinators.\n2. Better monitoring of coordination structures in the field.\n3. The instigation of more systematic consultation and communication processes through\ncoordination teams on the ground.\n4. Strengthening IASC-wide advocacy.\n5.4 Conclusion\nThis section has set out some of the tasks, services and structures that are seen as useful for\ncoordination, as well as some of those that have been less successful. Some of the tasks and\nservices that are most valued are among the weakest aspects of current coordination. It is also\nnotable that they are also the tasks that are essential to facilitate integrated responses to needs for\nhumanitarian assistance and protection, that is analysis, devising strategies with clear goals and\nstandards for the response, advocacy – including negotiating access and sustaining a framework of\nconsent – and monitoring and evaluating impact.\nImproving the provision of services will be critical to improving the ability of coordination teams to\npersuade others that coordination adds value. Improving the ability of coordination teams to perform\nthe integrating tasks is critical to improve the quality and  impact of humanitarian response.\nThe elements above offer suggestions for what should be part of a standard package for coordination\nprovided for the benefit of humanitarian actors. However, while it is essential that such functions are\nmore consistently provided and performed to a high standard, complex emergencies by their definition\npreclude a one-size-fits-all policy. The essential task of improving the capacity of the UN to supply\ncoordination must include awareness and analysis of the differing demands for coordination that\ndifferent crises pose. Thus the packages should be a menu of possible options and arrangements on\nwhich the IASC should decide in accordance with the demands of the particular context and\nemergency.\nDebating and agreeing this package is important. OCHA, in close discussion with IASC members,\nshould draw together the lessons from this study into a package of coordination services and tools,\nalong with the prototype office structures and staff competencies associated with providing them. This\ncan then be used as a menu of options on offer for all Coordinators.\n                                                          \n111\n  For example, see Duffield, Jones & Lautze (1998) op. cit.\n42Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n6: LIAISING WITH MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACTORS\nThe preceding chapters have focused on presenting findings on coordination between humanitarian\nactors. This section focuses on the interface between humanitarian actors and political and military\nactors and strategies. The study’s ToR asked whether, in different instances, the relationship between\nhumanitarian, development, political and military actors is seen to be coherent and mutually\nreinforcing. The team took the decision to focus on military and political actors rather than relief and\n112\ndevelopment linkages, as this remains the focus of ongoing research by the IASC.\nAs noted in Section 2, the interface between humanitarian actors and political and military strategies\nhas a huge impact on the conduct of humanitarian action. The scope of this study prohibits detailed\ndiscussion of the various facets of these interactions. Rather, this section focuses on the tensions\nwithin the UN around some of the interrelationships of its constituent parts.\n6.1 The Drive for Coherence and the View from the Ground\nIt is instructive that this study’s ToR asked about the coherence between political, military and\nhumanitarian actors. On the one hand, key political players in and around the UN are pushing for\nhumanitarian aid to be coherent with political and military aims. It is hard to pin down a precise\ndefinition of this coherence, however. The term is variously used to mean that all aspects of UN policy\nshould serve the same goals, that humanitarians should contribute to political goals, that political\nactors should not leave humanitarians in a policy vacuum, and that implementing multifaceted\nstrategies in complex settings should not be confounded by bureaucratic divisions. The drive towards\nintegration of all elements of the UN’s action in a particular country into one coherent strategy can be\ntraced back to the document, ‘An Agenda for Peace’, and is reflected in the logic behind the\n113\nSecretary-General's Secretariat reforms.\nOn the other hand, all three case studies offered powerful examples of the necessity for UN agencies\nin particular and humanitarian agencies in general to demonstrate their independence from the\ncontentious political strategies of the UN. The message that came loud and clear from interviewees\nwas that to achieve any respect for humanitarian principles and action, humanitarian actors have to\ncontinually demonstrate their independence from political and military strategies and action, whether\nof belligerents, UN Member States, national and regional militaries, or UN peace operations. How this\nis maintained is a matter of ingenuity. As one interviewee commented: ‘It is art not science on the\nground.’\nYet the nature of the political and military strategies and how beneficiaries and belligerents see them\n114\nis perhaps the key determinant for how humanitarians positions themselves. Interviewees stressed\nthat separation on the ground is not always necessary, or possible. The nature of the context affects\nthe relationship. Whether or not peace operations are mandated under Chapter Six or Seven of the\nUN Charter (with the critical distinguishing element of consent) is one factor in the complex calculation\nthat humanitarians have to make in terms of how to relate to UN political and military strategies.\nInterviewees and studies argued that association with the military might be necessary for security or\n115\naccess. Others suggested that where there is a clear shift from war to peace, humanitarians might\nretain distance during war and cooperate more closely after that. Yet in all instances, it remains\nessential that humanitarian action retains its independence.\n                                                          \n112\n  See Kent, R. (1999) Bridging the Gap: A Report on Behalf of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on\nPost-Conflict Re-Integration.

(2000) ‘Inside the wire? Civil-Military Cooperation in Complex Emergencies’, mimeo.\n115\n For example, Donini (1998) op. cit. p. 103.\n43Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nIn Somalia, the relationship between humanitarian and political actors is dogged by contentions over\nthe extent to which the UN is supporting the TNG as the basis for centralised authority over Somalia.\nThe incipient administrations in both Puntland and Somaliland both refuse to recognise the TNG as a\ncentral authority, and the representative of the Secretary-General was declared persona non grata in\nSomaliland as a result of the UN’s support for the TNG. The UN humanitarian agencies described\nhow they had to distance themselves from ‘that part of the UN’ in order to maintain operational\neffectiveness and personal security. One international NGO chose to withdraw from all committees in\nthe SACB except sectoral technical committees because it perceived the UN to have neglected its\nhumanitarian responsibilities by giving legitimacy to what the international NGO argued was a\nbelligerent group. It believed the UN had therefore implicitly declared itself as politically partisan.\nLikewise in the DRC, tensions between humanitarian actors and the political and military were\nanimated by the concern of the humanitarians to distance themselves from a peace operation\napparently discredited in the eyes of the population. One debate centred on the potential negative\nimplications for the Humanitarian Coordinator being designated the Deputy SRSG. Another bone of\ncontention was the role of the Humanitarian Liaison Officers (HLOs) of the United Nations\n116\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). Although agreement to\nincorporate the HLOs into the OCHA offices had been hammered out on the ground in Goma and\nKisangani, in Kinshasa, MONUC’s director of civil affairs proposed that MONUC should be doing\nhumanitarian coordination. This was interpreted by one interviewee as MONUC ‘doing an Angola’ –\nusing humanitarian aid as a way to retain presence and avoid downsizing in the absence of forward\nmovement in the Lusaka Peace Process.\nIn the DRC, NGOs and UN agencies alike were at pains to distance themselves from MONUC. Again,\nUN staff described having to explain to local populations, authorities and NGOs that they were ‘not\nthe political part of the UN’. This extended to international NGOs not attending meetings convened by\nMONUC in Kinshasa in order to demonstrate their separation. As a UN staff member remarked,\n‘Wherever we are associated with political strategies, we increase our own vulnerability and risk.’\n6.2 Views in the UN Secretariat\nThe situation on the ground is compounded by the fact that, at the highest levels in the Secretariat,\nviews are divided, or appear to fluctuate, on whether humanitarian assistance should be insulated\nfrom or integrated into broader political frameworks. The Secretary-General has stressed the\nimportance of respecting the distinction between humanitarian and military activities in order to\n117\nprevent irreparable damage to the principle of impartiality and humanitarian assistance. But he has\n118\nalso argued the converse. Among high level personnel within the Secretariat who were interviewed,\nhumanitarian agencies’ desire for distance was variously characterised as an attempt to avoid control\nor discipline, as bureaucratic blocking, or as an aversion to dialogue. Such views were often\naccompanied by arguments about how humanitarian aid must necessarily be subject to political\npriorities and, where possible, serve the UN’s political agenda. (Assertions that humanitarian aid does\nmore harm than good buttressed the logic of this position.) One interviewee in the Secretariat talked\nof humanitarian aid as a vital part of a ‘hearts and minds strategy’ for peacekeepers.\n6.3 The Role of the SRSG\nTensions also converge around debates about the role of SRSGs and the extent to which the SRSG\nis accountable for all aspects of the UN’s strategy in any given country. In countries where peace\noperations are deployed, the primacy of the SRSG has been the proposed mechanism by which\ncoherence is assured. However, interviews revealed that in a number of instances SRSGs have\ninterpreted ‘coherence’ as a justification for them to gain political mileage from control over\nhumanitarian assets. Ockwell (1999) further substantiates this, noting that SRSGs in Afghanistan,\nAngola, Somalia and Liberia all requested WFP to ‘adjust their programmes’ to facilitate their political\nnegotiations. For the politicians this may be expedient. But for the humanitarians it was necessary to\nresist such ‘coherence’ in order to preserve the distinction between political and humanitarian spheres\nessential to sustaining respect for humanitarian principles.\n                                                          \n116\n MONUC is one of the first missions to have a civil affairs unit, including sections for child protection, human rights and\nhumanitarian affairs.\n117\n Annan, K. (2000c) op. cit.\n118\n Annan, K. (2000a) Statement of the Secretary-General to the meeting of the Security Council on humanitarian aspects of\nissues before the Council, 9 March (United Nations: New York).\n44Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nThe Humanitarian Coordinator has a key role to play in upholding this distinction. The enthusiasm in\nsome quarters for Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators to also become deputy to the SRSG – under\ndiscussion in the DRC; now a reality in Sierra Leone – further complicates the picture for the\nhumanitarians in projecting a clear image of their independence from political strategies.\n6.4 Coherence and the Brahimi Report\nA key part of the coherence debate coalesces around the silence about the nature of the strategic\n119\ngoals of coherent strategies. For example, the push for all aspects of UN strategies to converge\naround peacebuilding in the wake of the Brahimi report is a form of ‘coherence’ that is largely seen as\nunproblematic, yet it masks unarticulated political agendas and the potential politicisation of\nhumanitarianism. In the report, the content of peacebuilding is depoliticised, stripped of the questions\nabout whose interests it serves. This vagueness masks the potential for peacebuilding to be the\n120\nfulfilment of the ‘monopolitics of liberal peace’. This is reinforced by the report’s silence on when to\nintervene to conduct peacebuilding. It cannot be assumed that peacebuilding, like peacekeeping, is\napolitical.\n121\nNor can it be assumed that peacebuilding is humanitarian. The Brahimi report’s proposal that\nhumanitarian aid buttress the success of peace operations by giving Force Commanders the\nwherewithal to provide humanitarian assistance is a powerful example of the potential for\n122\npoliticisation.\n6.5 The Potential Divisions among the Humanitarians\nAs with intra-humanitarian coordination, the relationship of UN agencies with non-UN humanitarians is\na critical part of the debate about the interface between political, military and humanitarian action. The\ncoherence sought or required of UN humanitarians has a major significance for their relationship with\nother humanitarian actors. As one humanitarian agency in the DRC put it, ‘The more the UN\ncombines the two, the more difficult it is for us.’  While some parts of the UN were clear that greater\nproximity to MONUC would jeopardise their relationship with NGOs, senior officials within MONUC\ndismissed this as an exaggeration, arguing that NGOs should not dictate to the UN. Key players in the\nUN Secretariat also appear dismissive of any dilemma, arguing that UN agencies have different\nresponsibilities from NGOs. This is clearly true. However, the humanitarian label links all those who\nuse it.\nFurthermore, NGOs are key players in the humanitarian system. As one UN interviewee commented,\n‘What is not understood in this building [the Secretariat] is that NGOs do the majority of the response.’\nQuestions raised by interviewees included: if UN humanitarians are required to get closer to the\npolitical and military, will they lose their implementing partner NGOs who are the bulk of the\nimplementing capacity? Will OCHA lose the other UN agencies? How will this affect the coordination\nand implementation of humanitarian action by the UN?\n6.6 Conclusion\nWhat emerges most strongly is the contrast between the emphasis on coherence from the key\nplayers in the Secretariat and the concern of humanitarian actors on the ground to guard their\nindependence – not as end in itself but as the cornerstone of practical strategies to attempt to sustain\na framework of consent from belligerents. This frequently involves demonstrating separation from\npolitical and military actors.\n                                                          \n119\n For a critique of an absence of framework or conceptual basis to guide military and humanitarian interaction see Lightburn,\nD. ‘NATO and its New Role’ in Whitman, J. & Pocock, D. (1996) After Rwanda: The Coordination of United Nations\nHumanitarian Assistance’ (Macmillan Press: London).\n120\n That is, the UN institutions will take on responsibility to deliver a blueprint that is built on narrow disciplinary structures in\nmuch the same way that the World Bank and the IMF have pushed the 'mono-economics' of structural adjustment. See Macrae\n& Leader (2000) op.cit.\n121\n The Brahimi report’s attempt to redefine impartiality to imply judgement, rather than its meaning for humanitarians – that is,\ndelivering aid solely on the basis of need, regardless of race, creed or nationality of the recipients and without adverse\ndistinction of any kind – highlights the importance of humanitarians resisting its uncritical integration into the peacebuilding\nagenda.\n122\n For a critique on this see SCHR (2000) op.cit.\n45Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nWhat also emerges is the need for greater clarity on the part of all players on their respective roles.\nThis will help to establish a clear division of labour and delimit responsibility among political, military\nand humanitarian actors, particularly around as yet undefined peacebuilding strategies.\nThe position that the ICRC adopts in relation to the rest of the humanitarian system offers instructive\nguidance on how to meet the challenge of articulating and institutionalising the appropriate\nrelationship between political, military and humanitarian strategies and actors in the UN. The ICRC\nstresses the imperative to coordinate with, but not to be coordinated by, others in the humanitarian\nsystem. Or, as another interviewee put it: ‘You’ve got to work closely together and keep your\ndistance.’ Such an approach has four key elements:\n1. Advocacy:  Advocacy is a critical tool in situating humanitarian action in relation to political and\nmilitary strategy. The endurance of the ‘aid does more harm than good’ argument among key\nparts of the Secretariat suggests that humanitarians have not advocated successfully enough\nabout their strategies and actions on the ground. If they are to be effective in the face of\ndismissive attitudes to humanitarian aid, humanitarians must be clearer and more assertive in\ntheir advocacy about the limits and nature of humanitarian action and principles. Humanitarians\nalso have to push politicians, diplomats, political affairs departments, the military, and the UNSC\nto uphold the right to humanitarian assistance and protection, and to assume their responsibility to\nwork for peace and security. Humanitarian advocacy must highlight the humanitarian implications\nof political and military action, as well as highlighting the consequences of inaction for populations\nin danger and those that seek to assist and protect them. Numerous interviewees stressed that\nthe ERC and OCHA should play a robust role in the Secretariat in this regard.\n2. Clear points of contact: Experience suggests that separation is best maintained by having clear\nand limited points of contact to enable information flow between political, military and\nhumanitarian strategies and actors. This has been the rationale behind the rise of Civil-Military\nCooperation Commissions (CIMICs) and was vital for effective liaison in Somalia, the Former\n123\nYugoslavia, and East Timor, to name but a few. Ambassador Brahimi’s approach in\nAfghanistan was applauded: although his role was entirely political, he sought information from\nhumanitarian agencies in order to base his decisions in the realities on the ground. Such contact\ncan contribute to more nuanced and profound political analysis on the part of both humanitarians\nand diplomats to ensure ‘a politically informed humanitarian response and a political response\n124\ninformed by humanitarian concerns’.\n3. Planning: If this difficult relationship is to be clearly articulated and understood, it will be\nnecessary to plan multifaceted strategies at headquarters and in the field. If not mutually\nreinforcing, at a minimum strategies must not undermine each other. Such planning is not easy.\nThe struggles that have accompanied the strategic framework experience in Afghanistan offer\n125\nimportant insights from which to learn and improve upon. The timeframes of rapidly developing\nsituations frequently inhibit effective planning. Often the lack of clear leadership and sufficient\ncapacity to translate robust political analysis into integrated responses creates difficulties.\nDifferent ethical and political compromises accompany the different aspects of the UN’s role.\nThere are many examples of resistance on the part of political or humanitarian players to\n126\ncooperate with one another. The Secretariat and agency headquarters must quash these\nimpulses.\n4. Political players should ‘pull their weight’: In practice, integration of humanitarian action into\npolitical strategies has been diluted by the weakness or absence of any such political strategy,\nand the 'delegation of responsibility for political analysis and management from the sphere of\n127\ndiplomacy to that of humanitarian action.' This highlights how the biggest challenge is not for\nhumanitarians to toe the political line, but for effective political strategies to be put in place to\naddress chronic political conflict and the violation of human rights. As the Brahimi report\nproposals suggest, this confers responsibility on DPA and DPKO to take on responsibility to\nprovide analysis at the service of the UN system and Member States. Humanitarians should be\nable to call on the politicians and diplomats for analysis and for diplomatic support and leverage.\n                                                          \n123\n For a concise and insightful account of the East Timor experience see Elmquist, M. (1999) ‘CIMIC in East Timor’, mimeo.\n124\n Macrae & Leader (2000) op. cit.\n125\n The reviews of the strategic framework that are currently underway are fundamental to this.\n126\n For example, the findings of the IASC Post-Conflict Reintegration Group say peace processes do not consult humanitarians.\nBoth Somalia and Kosovo case studies revealed how political players were not required to liaise with humanitarians.\n127\n Macrae & Leader (2000) op.cit.\n46Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n7: OCHA'S ROLE\nFrom its inception, and like its predecessor DHA, OCHA has found itself in the invidious position of\nhaving a mandate to coordinate but minimal means or clout to achieve it, in a system that has multiple\nobstacles to coordination, and shows determined resistance to its coordination role. The fact that the\nshift from DHA to OCHA cut back on posts funded from the core budget is a further indication of weak\ninstitutional commitment to the coordination function. This section briefly presents some of the study’s\nfindings on OCHA’s role, and outlines some of OCHA’s perceived successes, failures, obstacles to\nchange and thus some of the challenges ahead.\n7.1 The Successes\nOCHA has been judged effective when it has been able to provide dynamic, highly competent and\nexperienced people at the service of the whole humanitarian community. In some instances, these\nindividuals have provided leadership. In others situations, OCHA has provided hardworking, high-\ncalibre people to work alongside the Humanitarian Coordinators. This was generally a feature of the\ncase studies and was noted and valued by people across the system, including NGOs and the Red\nCross who, as discussed above, often feel ignored or excluded by the UN.\nOne particular feature common to successes in leadership or support was the quality of analysis and\nvision offered by OCHA staff. As highlighted in Section 5, analysis is invaluable in a time-constrained\nsystem that has to balance pressures to respond with devising strategies to meet needs for\nassistance and protection and the challenge of situating humanitarian action in relation to political and\nmilitary strategies.\nAnother feature of OCHA’s successes has been in negotiating access of beneficiaries to humanitarian\naid and protection. As noted earlier, there is some ambivalence about whether OCHA should do this\nfor the whole system but the value of past efforts are widely acknowledged as positive.\nOCHA increased its credibility in its early days by playing an effective advocacy role. Interviewees\nemphasised that this needs to be maintained and strengthened, particularly given OCHA’s position\ninside the Secretariat as the principal advisor to the Secretary-General on humanitarian affairs and\nthrough the ERC’s role representing the broader humanitarian community and its concerns for the\nvictims of conflict and disasters. However, key players also expressed concern about OCHA's ability\nto be an effective counterweight to the political pressures that converge in the Secretariat. OCHA has\nconceded that it has not yet fulfilled its potential advocacy role.\n7.2 The Failures\nDespite the above achievements, OCHA undermines its role by failing to deliver the required\ncoordination services with the right support at the right time with the right resources. All too many staff\nare slow to be deployed, given uncertain or no contracts, are poorly briefed before getting to the field,\nand denied effective handovers from previous incumbents of the position. OCHA also contributes to\nadhocracy by failing to standardise the functions it provides from one country to the next, and by\nhaving few opportunities for staff to learn from one another.\nOCHA is aware that it lacks the administrative procedures to support an organisation in the field. Both\nthe structural constraints of an office divided between New York and Geneva and financial constraints\nwere partly blamed by interviewees but weak management was also criticised.\nThis combination of financial, structural and management constraints were also cited as the cause of\nthe contractual difficulties that beset OCHA’s staff, leading to high staff turnover. For an organisation\nthat depends so heavily on the calibre of its people this should be considered a critical failure.\n7.3 The Threats to Change\nAlong with weak management there are other obstacles to implementing change, within and without\nOCHA. The strength of UN agencies' suspicions of OCHA, particularly evident in concerns about\nOCHA’s Change Process, do not bode well.\n47Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nIn the DRC and Kosovo, the team was struck by repeated agency efforts to minimise the profile\naccorded to OCHA even where OCHA staff were chiefly responsible for a particular action. In debates\nabout coordination options for the DRC prior to the December 2000 inter-agency mission, no UN\ninterviewee mentioned OCHA’s role in coordination. The resistance of the Humanitarian Coordinator\nin Kosovo to name the head of the OCHA office as his deputy could be seen as another manifestation\nof this.\nYet OCHA also jeopardises its potential achievements when it fails to consult or engage others\n128\neffectively. It is clearly tempting for OCHA to circumvent others when to do otherwise risks impasse\nbecause of the entrenched resistance in parts of the UN to OCHA performing its mandated role, or\nbecause of the time consumed in settings where time is precious. Yet evidence suggests that failing\nto engage others is simply counter-productive for OCHA’s credibility among agencies (even if not for\ntimely responses to people in need).\nOCHA needs to be clear that it is at the service of the system. Its Change Management report is\nclear, as are those at the highest levels within OCHA, that service is critical to OCHA’s role. Yet\namong field staff, one gets an impression that some staff are resistant to being accorded what they\nsee as a subservient role. The risk is that OCHA loses sight of the role it has to enhance the efforts\nand operations of others and that coordination activities become an end in themselves.\nThe push from higher levels within OCHA to raise OCHA’s profile also feeds fears that OCHA’s\nservice orientation is a rhetorical device rather than an organisational commitment. In the inevitable\nsearch for funds, it was clear that OCHA should be seeking funding for coordination and coordinated\noutcomes rather than for its own agency profile. OCHA should also be clear that its profile will be\nearned by the reputation of the services it provides and the quality of work it does, rather than through\nthe pursuance of profile for its own sake.\nAs highlighted above, although the support of key donors is clearly important for OCHA to be able to\nplay its mandated role, it is also vital that OCHA resists being solely driven by donor preferences and\nagendas. OCHA must resist the temptation to repeat the DHA experience of broadening its activities\nand thus diluting its impact in its core tasks. Such resistance is also essential if OCHA is to be an\neffective advocate on the rights to humanitarian assistance and protection: donor governments that\nare ‘Friends’ of OCHA are among those responsible for the skewed geographical allocation of\nhumanitarian aid.\nIt is also important as donor support may contain a sting in the tail: donor willingness to place trust\nfunds in OCHA’s hands feeds the fears of other agencies about mushrooming services and empire-\nbuilding. Several OCHA interviewees commented that DHA’s trust funds that had been cut are re-\nemerging. While welcomed by some – particularly some staff within OCHA who are exhausted by the\nfrustration of being expected to support coordination but having ‘nothing to offer’ – it is not clear that\nthis enthusiasm translates into greater donor commitment to the discipline and focus that coordinated\noutcomes requires. Donors may be setting OCHA up to fail.\n7.4 Conclusion: The Challenges\nOCHA's unenviable position of having a mandate that is undermined by lack of authority, resistance\nfrom UN agencies, and uncertain funding (as well as fluctuating performance on its own part) is a\nanother prime example of the structural obstacles to UN coordination. Setting aside the possibility of\nfundamental structural change, this section has focused on how OCHA can build its legitimacy and\ngain support. It has highlighted that, in the field, OCHA’s authority comes from providing quality\ncoordination services that are needed through the quality of its staff. The team strongly suggests that\nOCHA pursue this role, and become a centre of excellence for coordination skills, tools and systems\nin the countries in which it operates. To do this it needs to be able to get into the field quickly with\ngood people and the necessary equipment. This is something that is desired throughout the system.\n                                                          \n128\n The focal points for this study in WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNDP and DPA correctly laid this charge at the conduct of the\nearly stages of this study.\n48Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nYet fundamental to OCHA’s role is its position in the Secretariat – in the words of one interviewee,\nOCHA is ‘half in and half out’. That is, OCHA and the ERC, while being part of the humanitarian\ncommunity, also has its membership of the Senior Management Group, its role in ECHA and ECPS,\nand its regular briefings of the president of the UNSC, has a seat at the table of the Secretary-\nGeneral, as well as clear points of contact with the political and peacekeeping parts of the Secretariat,\nand, critically, the key decision-making organ on peace and security on the UN Member States. This\nputs it in a unique position for advocacy. It also presents a distinct challenge for OCHA: both to\nleverage its proximity to the Secretary-General’s office from which it can derive authority, while\ncontinuing to engage in robust advocacy with the Secretary-General and the highest levels of the\nSecretariat ‘fighting the humanitarian’s corner’.\nIndeed, a very clear message that came out of this study was the importance of OCHA maintaining\nand expanding its advocacy role. At the highest levels in the Secretariat, this advocacy should focus\non challenging particular interpretations of coherence as outlined in the previous section. This study’s\nfindings suggest that it is vital for OCHA to strategise with its sister UN agencies and other\nhumanitarians about how to push this advocacy agenda and to boost the sense that OCHA is\nrepresenting a shared humanitarian viewpoint during UN Secretariat debates and decisions.\n129\nAs a result of its Change Process, OCHA has set itself important goals. OCHA’s challenge now is a\nparadigmatic one: to elicit the support of others – agencies, the Secretariat, and Member States – to\nallow and enable it to implement the Change Process’s recommendations and successfully fulfil its\nmandate. To persuade its critics, OCHA must get better at doing what it is allowed to do.\nSpecific Areas for Action:\n• Coordination services and tools: In addition to the experiences laid out in Section 5, the team\nconcludes that OCHA should consolidate and develop its materials on coordination, drawing on its\nexisting documents, including the UNDAC Handbook, as well as other agency handbooks. In\naddition, OCHA should be able to provide coordination training materials.\n• Excellence in access negotiations, advocacy and political analysis are all seen as key roles\nfor OCHA. To do such negotiations effectively requires rock solid analysis, as well as back-up\ncapacity and resources devoted to this time-consuming activity.\n• Building in predictability: The IASC should urgently agree standard operating procedures for\nOCHA field offices. If OCHA is to play an effective role in offering coordination services for the\nbenefit of Coordinators, it is essential that the nature of the support and the nature of the\nrelationship are clarified and agreed at the IASC. This includes the question of whether the head of\nan OCHA office should also be the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator. OCHA should ensure that\nsuch services are consistently provided across the world. Bringing staff together regularly to learn\nfrom one another’s experiences is one route by which to assess consistency and improve practice.\n• It is imperative that OCHA retains highly competent core staff. Current levels of turnover are\ndisruptive and threaten loss of capacity. In addition, getting secondments from other humanitarian\nagencies was seen as a key to the success of the DHA, and should remain so for OCHA. Such\nsecondments should be seen as important for staff development rather than as deviation from\ncareer progression in the specific agency. It should also be possible for senior OCHA staff to have\nsecondments to other UN agencies and, indeed, to Red Cross agencies and international NGOs.\nThe latter option would strengthen the skills of OCHA staff while the former could increase\nownership and interest from UN agencies in enabling OCHA to fulfil its mandate.\n• In its concern to make coordination services more systematic, it will be important that OCHA\ndoes not merely provide another layer or allow coordination activities to become an end in\nthemselves. Where coordination is already happening, OCHA should offer to facilitate, add\nexpertise, or assist by relieving others of their responsibilities for coordination.\n• While the onus is in part on OCHA to perform and persuade, the study team maintains that there\nshould also be pressure on agencies to respect OCHA’s mandate from the Secretary-General\nand donors.\n                                                          \n129\n ‘Early deployment of sufficient, qualified OCHA personnel in support of a Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator is an important\nelement in successful humanitarian coordination…Coordination is effective only if our partners perceive its ‘value-added’, in\nparticular at the field level. OCHA must strive to create a culture of excellence by providing the best possible tools, managers\nand personnel in support of the R/HC and its humanitarian partners.’ The report notes the list of functions of an OCHA field\noffice that link with the tasks of the Humanitarian Coordinator. It notes the need to increase its headquarters support to its\nincreased presence in the field.\n49Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n8: CONCLUSIONS\n8.1 The Obstacles and Incentives to Change\nThere are two particularly striking characteristics of the discussion of humanitarian coordination. The\nfirst is the dichotomy between the resounding consensus about why coordination should be done – to\nmaximise the effectiveness of humanitarian action – and yet the continuing ferocity of the debate\nabout how it should be done. As this study has noted, the greater the focus on why coordination is\nimportant, the greater the likelihood that the debate diminishes and that effective coordination is done.\nThe second is that there is so little that is new to say. This has been a theme of this study as it\npresents the conclusions from past studies, interviews and case studies. The report has set out in\nsome detail the recurring picture over a decade of UN humanitarian agencies whose governance\nstructures, funding sources, weak management and institutional cultures all constitute obstacles to\neffective coordination. It has also described the blight of adhocracy that remains in how the UN\nsystem coordinates. The repeated refrains of reviews and studies suggest that a pivotal problem\nconfronting the system is its inability to change. This is the result of resistance on the part of Member\nStates and donors, and weaknesses internal to the system.\nThe evidence also reveals a ‘system’ that shows determined resistance to cede authority to anyone or\nany structure. Despite the urgency of the task, and the potential impact on human lives of poorly\ncoordinated humanitarian responses, the ERC, OCHA and Coordinators at the field level are all\ndenied the ability to direct or manage humanitarian responses. Instead, all have to work on the basis\nof coordination by consensus. In the face of the obstacles, this is an uphill struggle.\nTo eradicate some of these obstacles requires fundamental change. As this study has sought to\nemphasise, UN Member States and donor governments have pivotal responsibility for the structure\nand performance of the UN humanitarian system – and thus the changes necessary to resolve the\nproblems that derive from them.\nYet despite the manifold obstacles to coordination, remarkably, humanitarian coordination does\nhappen – although performance remains patchy – either because effective Coordinators build\nconsensus around coordination through strong leadership, because the coordination on offer is clearly\nadded value, or because the context acts as an incentive to coordinate.\nThus the study concludes that there is much that UN agencies can do to maximise the likelihood that\nhumanitarian response is effectively coordinated, despite the structural obstacles. It is incumbent\nupon them that they do so.\nIt is worth emphasising the responsibility that the UN has in the eyes of others. Governments and\nhumanitarian agencies have made their expectations clear. Indeed, Resolution 46/182 said it best,\nstating that the UN has ‘a central and unique role to play in providing leadership and coordinating the\nefforts of the international community.’ Yet this study has shown that there are others, in particular\ndonors, who will fill any vacuums left by a UN system that fails to deliver on its central coordinating\nrole. Thus, the onus is on the UN to perform to prevent the further bilateralisation of humanitarian\nresponse.\n8.2 Options for Change\nGiven these conclusions, the options for improving coordination range from fundamental change to\nremove obstacles, to more incremental ones to increase the incentives to coordinate. It is important to\nreiterate that none of the options for change or recommendations are entirely new. Many of them\necho recommendations of studies of coordination over more than a decade. This suggests that the\nproblem is not a dearth of recommendations about how to improve coordination, but a lack of\nboth management accountability for successes or failures and sufficient commitment to\nimproving humanitarian response.\n50Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n1. Fundamental structural reform of the UN's humanitarian operations\nGiven the accumulated evidence that consensus models are not strong enough to achieve\neffective coordination in the face of chronic systemic obstacles, the study believes that there is a\nstrong case to be made for structural reform. Notwithstanding the recent debate around UN\nreform, the scale of the problem suggests this debate must be reopened if there is genuine\ncommitment to strengthening the humanitarian response of the UN.\nThe limited scope of this study prohibits systematic consideration of detailed recommendations.\nBut it is clear that the challenge is to construct a body or structure with sufficient authority to be\nable to manage and guide humanitarian action – whether directly through a management line of\none single humanitarian agency, or through a sufficiently powerful new structure that stands\nabove existing funds and programmes to ensure prioritised and integrated responses. Such a\nstructure should link with political actors to devise the political strategies necessary to address the\ncauses of conflict and human suffering, as well as with development actors to ensure effective\ncoordination between relief and development activity. Such a structure would also need to retain\nthe elements currently fulfilled by diverse mandates; it should be both more efficient and\nresponsive; and it should be able to relate effectively to humanitarian actors outside the UN.\nIn a world of conglomerating NGOs who are increasingly favoured by donors, and where there is\ngreater momentum to integrate UN humanitarian operations into broader peacebuilding\napproaches, there are some who advocate that the debate should ask yet more fundamental\nquestions about the comparative advantage of the UN. They raise questions about whether,\ninstead of current levels of operational response, the UN should focus on 'core business' such as\ncoordination, setting standards, upholding protection for refugees and IDPs, monitoring, and\n130\nnegotiating access.\n2. Change the funding for humanitarian coordination and increase Coordinators' authority on\nthe ground\nIn the interests of more systematic and effective coordination, and to avoid those with\ncoordination responsibilities from competing with others, OCHA should be funded from assessed\ncontributions. At field level, in place of funding particular agencies in response to the Consolidated\nAppeal, donors should contribute funds to a common fund in the hands of the Coordinator who\nshould be vested with authority to prioritise and allocate funds to the strategy formulated by\nhumanitarian agencies in the field.\n3. Strengthening the Current Decentralised System\nAt the heart of change is the need for improved management, stronger accountability, and more\nsystematic approaches to coordination.\nThe current reliance on Coordinators and their teams having to persuade others to coordinate\nmust be buttressed by greater sanction attached to failing to coordinate. The commitment to\ncoordination should be fostered by requiring all staff to focus on the system-wide response to\nbeneficiaries’ needs rather than solely on their agency’s interests. At a minimum, all agencies\nmust expect and instil greater discipline through conventional management lines so that\npersonnel are assessed and rewarded on the basis of their participation and contribution to inter-\nagency coordination and coordinated outcomes.\nAll coordination structures and personnel should have clear guidance, reporting lines and defined\nrelationships with all other key players. There needs to be greater efforts from the system to\nmonitor coordination and to be quicker to resolve difficulties where they occur. Such difficulties\nshould be the subject of evaluation and subsequent lessons to be learnt.\nTo maximise the ability of coordination teams to persuade others to coordinate, greater financial\nand management resources should be directed at the provision of coordination services and tools\nthat clearly ‘add value’ to individual agency operations. This also requires greater leadership by\nhigh-calibre, experienced staff. OCHA has an important role to play in this.\n                                                          \n130\n For example, see Ingram (1993) op. cit. Ingram, former WFP director, suggests looking outside the UN system on which to\nbase a restructured humanitarian order. See also Minear, L. in Donini (1998) op. cit.; Righter (1995) op.cit. even suggests the\nOECD as a focus for coordinating relief.\n51Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n8.3 The Role of UN Member States and Donors\nEffecting any of these options requires action from several quarters. To reiterate: any change –\nwhether that of enduring systemic change or maximising the effectiveness of the current\nsystem – requires changes in the behaviour of Member States and donors.\nOverall, if Member States and donors want better humanitarian coordination, they must be prepared\nto fund coordination costs and to place their expectations only where mandated responsibilities lie.\nFunding coordination from assessed contributions is a vital part of this, as is establishing a fund for\nthe ERC to pay Humanitarian Coordinators.\nAmong the measures to maximise the effect of the current system, donors should support the\ndevelopment and agreement of indicators to assess coordination and its impact as well as the\ncontribution of agencies to it as a criterion for funding. Performance appraisal systems that assess\nstaff on the basis of their commitment to coordination in addition to the willingness of agencies to\nsecond competent staff could be among these indicators. Donors should apply greater pressure to\nUN humanitarian agencies and NGOs to support and respect the role of OCHA, as well as strengthen\nOCHA to work for the benefit of the humanitarian response rather than its own agency profile. Donors\ncan strengthen their coordination within and among themselves and demonstrate more consistent\nsupport to coordination through their funding and their presence on the legislative bodies of\norganisations (whether the UNSC, UNGA, or Executive Boards).\nAs well as increasing levels of humanitarian aid to ensure impartial response to all those in need,\ndonors should provide increased resources for efforts aimed at strengthening coordination such as\nmonitoring, appraisal, assessment and shared training. Donors should also contribute to common\nfunds, whether small additional funds for Humanitarian Coordinators to fill gaps in the response or,\nmore radically, a fund to receive all contributions to the CAP. Both measures should be accompanied\nby donor support for the Coordinator to undertake prioritisation in place of donor earmarking.\n8.4 The Role of the Secretary-General\nThe Secretary-General has a vital role in strengthening commitment to coordination and coordinated\noutcomes. He can lend the full weight of his authority to the ERC and insist that agencies respect\nOCHA’s role. He can push for greater system-wide orientation. He can also encourage the heads of\nthe operational agencies to second staff and establish rosters of those available, urge them to support\nthe creation of common funds for management by the Coordinator – whether for filling gaps in\nresponse, or more radically, to receive all funds for the CAP – and require that they strengthen the\nrequirement of their staff to contribute to coordinated outcomes by including this in performance\nappraisals.\nThe Secretary-General also has a critical role to play in reducing the adhocracy that currently blights\ncoordination, for instance by ensuring the implementation of the Brahimi report’s recommendations\nthat SRSGs, Force Commanders, Resident Coordinators and Humanitarian Coordinators all have\nclear guidance, reporting lines and relationships with all other key players. (The reservations\nregarding other aspects of the report have been outlined above.)\nFinally, the Secretary-General has important responsibilities to advocate that humanitarian action\nretains its independence from political and military strategies of the UN and Member States. For this\nto be effective, it requires clear points of contact and information exchange between political or\nhumanitarian players. The Secretary-General must quash resistance to this in DPA and DPKO.\n8.5 Consolidated Recommendations to the ERC, OCHA and the IASC\nThe following recommendations combine those elaborated in the text with additional\nrecommendations based on the study’s conclusions. These are among the measures that should be\nwell within the grasp of a UN system serious about the effective coordination of action to protect the\nrights of human beings to protection and assistance.\n52Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n8.5.1 Recommendations to the ERC and OCHA\nOCHA’s Change Management Report presents a raft of recommendations to address some of\nOCHA's weaknesses. This report recommends the following priorities:\n1. OCHA, in close discussion with IASC members, should draw together the lessons from this study\nas well as its current proposals for field coordination into a package of coordination services and\ntools, along with the prototype office structures and staff competencies associated with providing\nthem. This can then be used as a menu of options on offer for all Coordinators. This should be\npresented to the IASC for agreement with an associated action plan, including a training\nprogramme, to ensure that OCHA can provide quality coordination services.\n2. The ERC has a vital role to play in proactive monitoring of the conduct of coordination, particularly\nat the start of new emergencies, and reporting back to the IASC and to the Secretary-General.\nThe ERC may need an enhanced monitoring and evaluation capacity that reports directly to\nhim/her, using inter alia, indicators as recommended in recommendation A3 below.\n3. OCHA should further strengthen the CAP as an inter-agency analysis and strategy-setting\nprocess, including working with UN Country Teams to provide analysis tools and facilitation for\nthe process. The involvement in the analytical process of NGOs, the Red Cross Movement and\nUN political and military actors and analysts should be actively sought.\n4. The ERC has a vital role to play in robust advocacy – both within the Secretariat and with UN\nMember States – on the principles, role and limits of humanitarian action, and the political action\nrequired to uphold the right to humanitarian assistance and protection. ECHA and ECPS are\nimportant fora for advocacy on the nature, challenges and limits to humanitarian action; the ERC\ncan also press for action in the political, diplomatic and peacekeeping sphere. It will be important\nto strategise with other humanitarians about how to push this advocacy agenda and to boost the\nsense that OCHA is able to represent humanitarian actors within the UN Secretariat debates and\ndecisions. The IASC – given its broad membership – is the obvious forum for such strategising.\n8.5.2 Recommendations to the Inter-Agency Standing Committee\nIt is recommended that the IASC review the findings of this study and formulate an action plan for\nfollow up. Among the measures that should be included are the following:\nA. Appraisal\n1. The UN members of the IASC should review and revise existing performance appraisal schemes\nfor all staff. These should include criteria to measure demonstrated contribution to inter-agency\ncoordination and coordinated outcomes. Particular incentives should be attached to secondments\nto inter-agency efforts.\n2. The UN members of the IASC should establish an inter-agency working group to compare and\nharmonise performance appraisal schemes and the rewards and sanctions associated with\ncontributing to coordination or thwarting it.\n3. The IASC should agree performance appraisal criteria and a regular appraisal process for\nHumanitarian Coordinators. This should include indicators for behaviour or action that would\ntrigger a process of review leading to removal from the position.\n4. The IASC should work with donors to identify indicators of coordination and coordinated\noutcomes as the basis for funding decisions. Performance appraisal systems that assess staff on\nthe basis of their commitment to coordination, and the willingness of agencies to second\ncompetent staff, should be among these indicators.\nB. Recruitment of Coordination Staff\n1. The IASC should intensify its efforts to work with the UNDG and OCHA to agree the\ncompetencies and selection processes for Resident and Humanitarian Coordinators. This should\ninclude agreement of where skills for Humanitarian Coordinators might differ from or clash with\nthose expected of Resident Coordinators.\n2. All IASC member agencies should intensify efforts to establish an inter-agency roster of\ncoordination staff that indicates staff skills and availability. They should do this by undertaking a\nthorough process of identifying individuals with aptitude for coordination positions – whether as\nHumanitarian Coordinators or support staff – including those with potential but who may require\ntraining.\n53Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3. The IASC should explore with non-UN members the potential for extended secondments of NGO\npersonnel as Coordinators and support staff. This would require the agreement of potential\ntraining needs necessary for non-UN staff to work for the UN.\nC. Induction Processes\n1. The IASC should form an inter-agency working group on induction processes to compare current\nguidance and information provided to new staff. On the basis of this review, this group should\ndevelop a series of training materials and processes for generic guidance to help staff anticipate\nand overcome challenges. This would be provided to all staff going to the field, or as refresher\ncourses for existing staff. Such materials should include information on mandates, activities and\ncompetencies of all IASC members, humanitarian principles, Sphere standards, impact indicators,\nand security, as agreed by the IASC. This could constitute a common UN humanitarian\nhandbook.\n2. The IASC should agree that one of the aspects of the coordination package provided by OCHA\nshould include providing induction guidance tailored to the specific context to offer as a service to\nincoming staff of all humanitarian agencies. This could also have an additional benefit of\nencouraging staff to deepen their understanding and their political, economic and social analysis\nthat is essential to effective humanitarian response.\n3. All IASC members should commit themselves to making handovers between staff more\nsystematic by including them in all job descriptions as a corporate requirement of all departing\nstaff. At headquarters, management should be improved to increase the number of handovers\nthat take place.\nD. Monitoring\n1. The IASC should agree a process to evaluate field coordination at regular intervals in order to\nincrease both its responsiveness and ability to resolve problems. This could include a) regular\nreporting against agreed benchmarks to the IASC by IASC members in the field, and b) a process\nof small inter-agency teams travelling to the field to carry out agreed systematic assessments\nbefore reporting back to the IASC.\n2. An assessment of the contribution of agencies to coordination and coordinated outcomes should\nbe part of the process of the mid-term CAP review. This could include agency self-assessment\nagainst agreed criteria, potentially backed up by independent evaluation.\nE. Reporting Lines and Accountability\n1. The IASC should agree the relationship, reporting lines and accountability of all those involved in\ncoordination, in particular between the head of the OCHA field coordination unit and the\nHumanitarian Coordinator.\n2. The IASC should agree who will deputise for the Humanitarian Coordinator in all instances,\nincluding a protocol for further contingency arrangements should it be necessary to further\ndeputise for the deputy. This should exclude those with responsibilities for operational\nprogrammes where there are alternatives. This makes a strong case for the head of OCHA offices\nbeing appointed as the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator.\nF. Country and Regional Structures\n1. IASC members should agree to replicate the IASC at the field level in all instances.\n2. IASC members should adopt the same designations of what constitutes a region as a first step to\nfacilitate regional coordination, and should work towards having any regional structures co-\nlocated with those of other agencies.\n3. IASC members should instigate more systematic consultation and communication with\ncoordination teams in the field.\n54Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nG. Advocacy\n1. The IASC should form an advocacy working group to agree a broad framework for advocacy\nstrategies towards UN Member States, donors, belligerent groups, and other parts of the UN\nincluding DPA, DPKO and the Office of the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General,\nat headquarters, country and local level. This would include responsibilities for the ERC and IASC\nmembers at headquarters and in the field. It is vital that UN agencies continue robust advocacy\nwith donors on their obligations to respect the humanitarian principles of universality and\nimpartiality.\n2. All IASC members should collaborate with OCHA in pressing UN Member States to fund\ncoordination – both OCHA and Humanitarian Coordinators – from assessed contributions.\nH. Systemisation\n1. The IASC should agree a package of coordination services and likely accompanying structures to\nbe prepared by OCHA as the basis for coordination structures in country as standard operating\nprocedure for OCHA. This should include agreement on the potential value of OCHA having a\npresence in the field at sub-office level to provide effective coordination support.\n2. The IASC should make clear specifications on these coordination structures, the required\ncompetencies and the reporting relationships as part of all decisions on coordination options\nconsidered by the UN and the rest of the IASC.\n3. The IASC should agree a matrix of MoUs to be negotiated to complement existing MoUs.\nI. On the CAP, all IASC members should work with OCHA to:\n1. Strengthen the CAP as a valuable opportunity for inter-agency analysis and strategy setting,\nincluding both operational response and advocacy strategies.\n2. Require Coordinators to actively seek the involvement of NGOs and the Red Cross Movement in\nthe analysis process, if not the fundraising strategy.\n3. Improve the accuracy and transparency of the CAP’s assessment of target beneficiaries to\nincrease its use as an advocacy tool. This will help in assessing and comparing international\nresponses to humanitarian need.\n4. Give a stronger remit to Coordinators to facilitate prioritised, integrated strategies to respond to\nhumanitarian need.\n5. Under effective and accountable Coordinators in an improved system of coordination, donors\nshould be required to place their responses to Consolidated Appeals in a single country fund –\nrather than funding individual agency activities – in the hands of a Coordinator.\n55Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nANNEXE 1: TERMS OF REFERENCE\nTerms of Reference for a Study\nHumanitarian Coordination\nLessons from Recent Field Experience\nBackground\n1. The need to coordinate humanitarian assistance in places of armed conflict has long been\nrecognised within the United Nations. The decentralised nature of the UN system, consisting of a\nnumber of different programmes and specialised agencies mandated to respond to situations of\nhumanitarian need has made ‘coordination’ a declared aim of successive Secretaries-General. As the\nUN found itself (during the 1980s) increasingly obliged to offer humanitarian assistance in situations\nof internal armed conflict, a ‘lead agency’ was sometimes appointed from amongst the principal\nhumanitarian agencies, while in other situations special ad hoc coordination bodies were established,\nsuch as UNOCA for Afghanistan in 1988 and OEOA for the Horn of Africa.  In response to a growing\nconcern that such ad hoc arrangements were not fully satisfactory, the General Assembly, in\nDecember 1991, adopted Resolution 46/182, which created the Inter-agency Standing Committee and\nthe post of Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), with the goal of improving the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the UN’s humanitarian operations in the field.  In 1992 the Secretary-General\nestablished the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), with the ERC serving also as Under-\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.\n2. In 1994, the IASC approved the terms of reference for Humanitarian Coordinators who would\n‘upon the occurrence of a complex emergency in a country’ be appointed by the Emergency Relief\nCoordinator on behalf of the Secretary General and would be the senior UN official on the ground in\ncharge of ‘coordinating’ international humanitarian assistance.  It was agreed that the UN Resident\nCoordinator serving in the affected country would ‘normally’ become the Humanitarian Coordinator.\nHowever, two other possibilities were also foreseen, that a Humanitarian Coordinator might be\nappointed separately from the Resident Coordinator (or in a situation in which there was no Resident\nCoordinator), or that a ‘lead agency’ might be designated, whose local Director would exercise the\nfunctions of Humanitarian Coordinator.  As part of the Secretary-General’s reform programme of\n1997, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) replaced DHA.  In 1998 the\nUNDP Administrator and the ERC wrote jointly to all Resident Coordinators reminding them that in\nsituations where they found themselves leading the UN’s response to a natural disaster, they were\nresponsible directly to the ERC.\n3. Today, in most places of armed conflict where the UN has some presence, there is a\nHumanitarian Coordinator, who is also the Resident Coordinator, reporting to the ERC.  The ‘lead\nagency model’ however, is also sometimes still employed, most recently in Bosnia-Herzegovina and\nin Kosovo.  In both Kosovo and East Timor, where the UN has formed an interim administration, a\n‘Humanitarian Pillar’ has been part of an ‘integrated’ peacekeeping operation.\n4. A number of inter-related processes are underway, which underline the need to sharpen\nthinking on UN humanitarian coordination.  The first is the continuing debate on whether it is possible\nto identify more clearly the criteria which should be applied in selecting one or other of the three\n‘models’ of humanitarian coordination. This debate was most recently reinvigorated by the\nintervention of the US Permanent Representative to the UN in several fora, and his request to the\nSecretary General to employ the ‘lead agency model’ more frequently.\n56Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5. Secondly, the Secretary General’s Panel on Peace Operations recently submitted its report\nwith specific recommendations for Secretariat reform, to which the Secretary-General has responded\noutlining his initial plans for implementation. By dealing almost exclusively with the need to\nstrengthen the mandating, planning, and management of peace-keeping operations, the Panel’s\nrecommendations did not address the question of the appropriate relationship between peace-keeping\nand humanitarian operations of the UN system.  Nor did they examine the implications for\nhumanitarian organizations of the new peace-keeping doctrine which they propose.  This will need to\nbe developed separately at UN system-wide level.\n6. Thirdly, work has recently been completed within the Secretariat (in the form of a Note of\n1\nGuidance ) to clarify and make more effective the relationship between the various senior officials\ndeployed to the field, including the Secretary General’s representatives, the Humanitarian\nCoordinators and the Resident Coordinators.  This work has run parallel to work in the IASC to\n2\nclarify the role of Humanitarian Coordinators in relation to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) .\nWork has also recently been completed in the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA)\non the allocation of responsibilities within the UN system for different aspects of demobilization\n3\nprogrammes .\n7. Finally, there are the innovative or at least new and different schemes which have been tried\nin recent months, related to humanitarian coordination, which deserve study.    These include the\nexperiences of humanitarian coordination in Kosovo and East Timor and OCHA’s work to establish\nor strengthen its local offices or units to assist in coordination in a number of other countries.\nThe Need\n8. The need is for a study, which will assist the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Inter-\nAgency Standing Committee to draw lessons from recent experiences in humanitarian coordination,\nwith a view to better understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each coordination model in\nparticular circumstances, leading to a clearer definition of criteria for choosing the most appropriate\ncoordination arrangements in any given situation.\n4\n9. A number of relevant studies have been undertaken in recent years . This study needs to take\nfully into account the lessons offered by previous research, while factoring in lessons from most\nrecent field experience, all in the context of an environment affected by the Brahimi panel and recent\nwork in ECHA, the IASC and the Secretariat. There is also a need for an up to date overview of the\nactual coordination arrangements currently in place.\nScope of the Study\n10. The study is therefore intended to be a resource for the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the\nIASC.  The study should analyse, through both primary research and a review of secondary literature,\nthe range of humanitarian coordination experiences from the field in recent years. The focus should be\non helping identify practical and specific arrangements and practices which have worked the best, and\nthose that have failed or need reform, in a way which will respond to the need defined above.\n11. Given the wealth of coordination studies that already exist, the study should summarize the\nprincipal findings within the existing literature, and carry out primary research only on those cases\nwhich have yet to be comprehensively examined.\n12. In examining each situation, the study will seek to identify those features of the coordination\narrangements which were seen, by those involved, to have provided ‘added value’, as well as those\nwhich were felt not to have contributed to the effective coordination of the overall humanitarian\noperation. Among the issues to be examined would be the following:\n57Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n- Is the CAP process perceived as an aid to effective coordination?\n- Is the relationship between humanitarian, development and political/military actors seen\nto be coherent and mutually reinforcing?\n- Is access a problem? If so, do humanitarian actors believe that current coordination\narrangements ensure that the problem is being addressed as effectively as possible?\n- Do all the actors feel that they have the information they need to coordinate their\noperations effectively with each other? How do they believe that information-sharing and\ninformation management could be improved?\n- Is sectoral coordination perceived to be working well?\n- Has there been any attempt to introduce strategic monitoring of the humanitarian\nprogramme?\n- Is the coordination model in place perceived by humanitarian actors to be appropriate?\n13. The study will need to be informed by:\n(a) Published studies on humanitarian coordination and related topics as well as in-house United\nNations evaluations, ‘lessons-learned’ and other relevant policy documents\n(b) Current debates and discussions within the IASC membership and the UN Secretariat on the\nstrengthening of humanitarian coordination, with a particular focus on recent work on the\nrelationships between SRSGs, Resident Coordinators and Humanitarian Coordinators; and the\nresponsibilities in relation to IDPs and DDR\n(c) The findings of the Secretary General’s panel on peace operations and the implementation of the\nrecommendations of the report\n(d) OCHA’s recent internal management review and related processes\n(e) Trends in donor attitudes towards humanitarian coordination.\n14. The study may look at cases throughout the entire history of UN humanitarian coordination\nbut will focus on experiences since 1992, and will do primary research on current situations.\n15. The study will not address coordination arrangements in countries afflicted by natural\ndisasters, since these arrangements are well established and not seen to be in need of review.\n16. The study will not need to be long or excessively detailed but will be comprehensive in\nbringing together all the various elements upon which future deliberations on humanitarian\ncoordination arrangements may best be made.\nMethodology\n17. The study would be undertaken by a team comprised of two independent consultants and one\nor more members of the OCHA policy development unit.\n18. The study would draw on three primary categories of sources.  The first would be extant\nliterature on this subject, including and especially work which has looked at humanitarian\ncoordination arrangements and experiences in specific country settings.  The second source would be\nUN documents and interviews with as wide a range of relevant people as possible, including but not\nexclusively past and present humanitarian coordinators, OCHA staff, and the staff of various\nhumanitarian agencies and NGOs.  The third source would be two or three missions to the field, to\nexamine in greater detail three ongoing humanitarian operations as mentioned above.\n58Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n19. It is expected that the research including the field missions could be concluded within 2-3\nmonths and that the writing and editing of the paper could be done in approximately four weeks.   The\nfinal paper is expected to be no more than 15,000 – 20,000 words.\n20. An advisory group of focal points from UNDP, UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, DPA and DPKO\nwill be established to support the study.   These focal points will be asked to facilitate the research of\nthe study team in relation to their respective departments and agencies and will be presented with\ndraft of the study for their comments and suggestions.\n21. A peer reference group of experts on the subject will also be established to assist the study\nteam at various stages as necessary.\nTime Frame\n22. Ideally, the two outside consultants would be identified, recruited and begin work in October.\nThe majority of field missions as well as interviews would be completed by mid-December.  A draft\nstudy would be shared with OCHA as well as the advisory group  by late January and a final text\ncompleted in February.\nFootnotes\n \n1.

Context\nIn November 2000, in its third year of conflict, the DRC was still deeply divided between warring\nparties. At that time, the number of people displaced by the conflict totalled an estimated 2.1 million.\nAcross the country, the population’s coping mechanisms were at their limits, and levels of vulnerability\nand food insecurity were deteriorating. Such a context presents profound challenges to effective\nhumanitarian response and coordination – especially when infrastructure is absent or decayed, as in\nthis case. This poses profound constraints on movement across the country. Furthermore, the small\nnumber of implementing partners spread sparsely across the country and the low levels of donor\nsupport for humanitarian action are insufficient to meet the needs of the struggling populations.\nThere is a fluctuating relationship between levels of funds and access in the DRC – at times, funds for\nresponse have eclipsed agencies’ ability to access beneficiaries, while at other points it has been the\nreverse. In the east, security concerns have been the major factor in access; this has been improving.\nIn the west, the limits placed by the government on aid agencies’ movements have constrained\naccess. The imposition of a fixed exchange rate has also penalised agencies and, in the west, this\nand access are cited as the major strategic challenges.\nFinally, the faltering Lusaka Peace Accords directly affect the humanitarian response. The United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) has been unable to\nmake headway in its goal to prepare the ground for military observers to monitor compliance with\nceasefire obligations. Security constraints restricts movement with the result that personnel deployed\nso far are unable to fulfil their mandated task and are struggling to engage in constructive activities.\nThe Special Representative of the SRSG is finding it difficult both to encourage warring parties to\nstand by their commitments and to sustain the interest of UN Member States. Donors are unwilling to\ncommit funds to the country.\n2. Coordination Structures\nThe DRC is the size of Western Europe. While it is divided across multiple front lines, humanitarian\ncoordination is able to take place at a number of levels. The team focused on coordination in the\ncapital Kinshasa, and North and South Kivu.\nKinshasa\nFrom the end of 1997 to mid-1998 there was a succession of Resident Representatives a.i. In mid-\n1998 the Regional Representative of UNHCR was appointed Humanitarian Coordinator and remained\nso until end 1999. His operational responsibilities as head of agency were given to a deputy. During\n1999, an OCHA unit was created with UNDP funding, but by May 2000 this was funded directly by\ndonors.\n2.1 Current Structures\n• The UN Country Team is headed by a Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. who has been in place since\nJanuary 2000. He is also the UNICEF representative. He is supported by OCHA in Kinshasa,\nwhich has four professional officers and national staff. OCHA is one of the key liaison points with\nthe government authorities in both east and west.\n• OCHA convenes weekly meetings on Wednesday afternoons for the UN, NGOs, and the Red\nCross. This is the key forum for information exchange in Kinshasa.\n• A government  ‘Crisis Commission’, chaired by the Ministry of Health, is called on an ad hoc basis\nin response to a particular crisis. It involves the UN, NGOs (both local and international), and the\nRed Cross.\n• UN Country Team meetings occur infrequently.\n• MONUC convenes Friday morning meetings that NGOs do not attend.\n• International NGOs (INGOs) meet on Fridays. This involves five to six INGOs.\n• The Red Cross convenes meetings every week between all its international sections, and once a\nmonth with the Congolese Red Cross.\n64Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nNorth Kivu\nIn Goma, the history of coordination has gone through several phases. In the early 1990s, local and\ninternational NGOs worked together to assist 300,000 people displaced by fighting in the Masisi area.\nThese efforts were eclipsed by the Rwandan refugee influx for which UNHCR had coordination\nresponsibility between 1994 and 1996. With the onset of war in the eastern DRC in 1996, UN\nagencies withdrew; they were slow to return. As the first UN agency to return, UNICEF was asked by\nthe Humanitarian Coordinator in Kinshasa to assume the coordination role for North Kivu.\n2.2 Current Structures\n• The Provincial Coordinator from UNICEF is supported by an OCHA staff member.\n• OCHA has one Senior Humanitarian Affairs Officer, two international Humanitarian Affairs\nOfficers, and several national staff. Together with the Provincial Coordinator, this is referred to\ninformally as ‘The Coordination.’\n• The local authorities have various Comités Techniques that convene NGOs to talk with them on a\nmonthly basis. These structures are acknowledged to be more important for protocol than\npractical implementation.\n• The Provincial Coordinator chairs a meeting every Monday for the UN agencies in Goma.\n• The UN Security Management Team meets on ad hoc basis.\n• UN agencies and local and international NGOs meet on Fridays to discuss information on security\nand programming. This meeting has a rotating chair.\n• The ECHO representative calls NGOs together to discuss health interventions.\n• A few INGOs have informal meetings to share analysis that draws on that of experienced\nCongolese staff.\n• Sectoral Coordination: In June 2000 ‘The Coordination’ established five commissions to devise\nstrategies for five sectors. (These have since been wound up, to the dismay of some participants.)\nEach of the commissions, headed either by a UN agency or an INGO, involved local structures\nsuch as chef de departments, local NGOs, and the five main religious groups. The participants\n(120 in all) were asked to define the challenges and solutions to turn into on strategies for each\nsector.\nSouth Kivu\nOne of the challenges for coordination is the relationship between international NGOs and an\nincreasingly politicised local civil society. Local groups and activists have been highly critical of\nMONUC.\n2.3 Current Structures\n• The Provincial Coordinator from WFP has recently been strengthened by support from an OCHA\nstaff member.\n• Local authorities have recently nominated a focal point for contact with agencies. Previously the\ngovernor had been the point of contact.\n• The Provincial Coordinator convenes a weekly UN Country Team meeting.\n• The UN has a weekly meeting with international NGOs and Red Cross agencies.\n• Sectoral coordination: The Provincial Coordinator has established commissions to devise\nstrategies for different sectors, each comprised of four to five agencies who nominated a\nCoordinator. Only UN agencies and international NGOs in Bukavu are involved in the\ncommissions. Unlike the North Kivu commissions, in South Kivu the commissions continue to\nserve as a focus for sectoral coordination on an ad hoc basis.\nKisangani, Bunia, Kasai, Gbadolite and Kindu\nThe team were unable to explore in detail coordination experiences in these five locations.\n65Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n2.4 Current Structures\n• OCHA has one OCHA Humanitarian Affairs Officer who reports on events in each place.\n• INGOs have established structures to exchange information or to collaborate with one another in\nresponse to the needs of the situation – for example, when an epidemic strikes. In Kisangani, the\nthree INGOs working in health meet regularly to discuss their planned action.\n• Agencies in Kisangani interface with a Comité Technique, established by the authorities.\n• Every Wednesday a meeting on security is chaired by MONUC. UNICEF also coordinates weekly\nmeetings.\n3. Coordination Tools\n• The Emergency Humanitarian Initiative fund (EHI) of $4m was designed as a rapid response trust\nfund to be managed by an interagency group that gets reports/proposals from OCHA and\napproves interventions on the basis of agreed criteria. In reality, there has never been a formal\nmeeting of this group. Instead, proposals recommended OCHA are discussed by the UN Country\nTeam members and key donors. To date, proposals have included funding an airlift capacity, and\nthe purchase and provision of emergency supplies.\n• Information sharing meetings (as described above).\n• Situation reports– in North Kivu, these were described as well presented and timely.\n• Analysis papers from OCHA on the situation in particular provinces or pressing humanitarian\nissues.\n• The Consolidated Appeal.\n4. Good Practice\n• OCHA has ensured that it works with NGOs and the Red Cross Movement, not solely UN\nagencies, as it has recognised that the NGOs and Red Cross are the key players currently\nundertaking humanitarian response in the DRC. All INGO interviewees viewed OCHA as their\nprimary interlocutor in the UN and as a key source of support in their negotiations with authorities,\nin the exchange of information, in international advocacy for funds, and as a source of logistics\nthrough the EHI initiative.\n• OCHA has played a key role in negotiating access to beneficiaries. This was highly valued by\nNGOs.\n•\n OCHA staff in both east and west DRC are able to offer sound political, socio-economic and\nhumanitarian needs analysis to inform the actions of the rest of the humanitarian community.\n• In Kinshasa and Goma INGOs come together weekly to share analysis of the humanitarian\nsituation and to discuss their possible responses to meet humanitarian need.\n• In Kisangani, INGOs have collaborated to coordinate their operations and advocacy strategies to\npress for more implementing partners to come to the DRC.\n• OCHA’s advocacy towards the donors for fundraising and to the UN Security Council on the plight\nof the Banyamulenge are both powerful examples of OCHA’s potential to undertake effective\nhumanitarian advocacy\n• Many NGOs and UN sought out the advice of OCHA’s Senior Humanitarian Adviser before\nundertaking any interactions with local authorities in the east. This was seen as a key\npolitical/diplomatic role, essential of a Coordinator.\n• In North Kivu, several NGOs gathered together to do a study on salary scales; the results mean\nthey now have guidance for eastern DRC. NGOs also came together to establish a common\nposition on taxation in the east in order to be able to speak with one voice to the authorities, who\nwere claiming 27 different taxes.\n• OCHA has organised training sessions on food security, flood response, presenting information\nabout risks, facts, and preparedness measures to raise standards and ensure more harmonised\nhumanitarian responses.\n66Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5. Weaknesses\n• One of the most striking features of coordination in DRC were the high levels of competition,\ntension and mistrust among UN agencies.\n•\n While some UN staff acknowledged the value and dynamism of the role played by OCHA staff,\nothers appeared determined to minimise or restrict OCHA’s role and profile in coordination. As a\nresult, OCHA appeared to have a precarious role within the UN Country Team that required\nconstant careful diplomacy to sustain the cooperation of other UN colleagues.\n• The inclusion of local NGOs in coordination structures has proved highly contentious in South\nKivu where agencies fear that information and analysis shared among the humanitarian\ncommunity has been used for political purposes by local groups.\n• Poor communication within and among organisations across the frontlines has led to diverging\nperceptions of the situation on either side of the frontline. This had further led to misconceptions\nin Kinshasa about the degree of access in the east, which has impaired their support and\nresponse to colleagues in the east.\n• The intense debate about coordination structures in Kinshasa (particularly strong in the run-up to\nan Inter-Agency Mission to DRC in December 2000) has been at the expense of assessment and\nsupport to coordination structures in the provinces.\n• There are unclear reporting lines among all staff with coordination responsibilities, and many staff\nreported a lack of effective briefing and induction. The Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. argued there\nneeded to be greater clarity about responsibilities vis-à-vis the SRSG, OCHA’s role, and the\nresponsibilities for agencies leading coordination at sub-national level.\n• OCHA’s precarious role within the UN Country Team has impaired its ability to play a robust\nadvocacy role towards the SRSG, the Secretary-General, the UN Security Council and other UN\nMember States who are pushing for greater integration of the UN’s political and humanitarian\nobjectives in the DRC.\n•  While some UN personnel were anxious to support NGOs, others showed little interest in non-UN\nagencies despite the fact that NGO programmes constitute the majority of the international\nhumanitarian efforts in the DRC. UN personnel and international NGO staff gave examples of how\nNGOs had been excluded or ignored, or where UN-NGO collaboration was weak despite\nsimilarities of mandate or activity. For example, one UN staff member described how some UN\nCountry Team members would walk out of an inter-agency meeting once the INGOs arrived. An\nNGO interviewee described how a UN operational agency had negotiated with authorities to\nunblock its lorries, but had not negotiated access for the NGO lorries that were also blocked.\n• The lack of a strategic plan, agreed standards for the response and the lack of strategic\nmonitoring for humanitarian action in the DRC. Although Principles of Engagement in DRC were\nagreed in November 1998, these have not been effectively used.\n67Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nANNEXE 4: SOMALIA CASE STUDY\n1. Context\nSomalia is a prominent example of a chronic conflict that has continued for almost a decade since the\nonset of factional fighting and the collapse of the government in 1991. Persistent poverty, drought and\nfactional violence cause an estimated 750,000 people to remain vulnerable and food insecure across\nthe country. However, the northern parts of the country have been free of the worst of conflict for last\nfive years.\nIn 1991 the north west province of Somaliland declared itself independent, later enshrining this in a\nconstitution in 1997 constitution, and although not recognised internationally, its administration seeks\nto perform governmental functions. In 1998, the neighbouring northeast province declared itself the\nPuntland State following joint statements from the Somalia Aid Coordination Body (SACB) – including\nthe UN Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), the European Commission (EC), the\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator, UN agencies, donors and NGOs - that it would support peaceful\nregions and emerging regional administrations as the building blocks for a peaceful, federated state.\nUnlike Somaliland, Puntland continues to see itself as part of Somalia and has established an\nadministration, although public services are minimal.\nIn the south, the Transitional National Government (TNG) has been in place since November 2000 as\na result of agreement brokered among factions in Djibouti. It has not, however, extended its hold\nbeyond parts of Mogadishu. Neighbouring Ethiopia continues to demonstrate its antipathy to an\nIslamic state in the south of the country by offering the support to particular factions of Ethiopian\ntroops posted inside Somalia.\nThe UN’s involvement in Somalia cannot be divorced from the legacy of the events during the early\n1990s, and a series of ill-fated efforts by peacekeepers to facilitate humanitarian aid. The beginning of\nthe 1990s witnessed a swathe of asset stripping and violence against the population by armed\nfactions, resulting in a descent into violence and an acute famine emergency between 1991 and\n1993. This prompted the UN Security Council to deploy peacekeepers to protect the delivery of\nhumanitarian assistance. The initial force – the small, weakly mandated UN Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) – appeared to fuel protection rackets rather than feed the hungry. It was replaced by the\nUS-led mission of Operation Restore Hope that in turn was replaced by UNSOM II. The October 1993\ndebacle which involved the deaths of 20 troops – 18 of them American – in retaliation for UNOSOM's\npursuit of one warlord for his part in killing 28 Pakistani peacekeepers, prompted the UN to withdraw\nfrom Somalia, its credibility in tatters.\nSince this debacle, donor fatigue with crisis in Somalia has grown and deepened. Consequently,\nSomalia has witnessed a steady stream of departing humanitarian agencies as well as the\ndownscaling of operations among those agencies that have remained.\n2. Coordination Structures\nNairobi\nIn Nairobi, coordination coheres around the SACB at various levels. The SACB was founded through\nthe agreement of international agencies that the rehabilitation of the devastated country required\nstronger donor involvement in coordination. The Addis Ababa declaration of 1 December 1993\nenvisaged that the SACB would include donors, UN agencies and programmes, NGOs, multilateral\nand regional institutions and organisations to coordinate on various aspects of international aid to\nSomalia. The mandate ascribed to SACB was to ‘operate until such time as Somalia re-establishes\ninstitutional machinery for national development management and aid coordination, and for\ncoordination of development assistance with its international partners.’ The EU, Somalia’s single\nlargest donor, was given the chair of the SACB. (However, it no longer holds the chair of any of the\nmain SACB committees.)  Membership of the SACB is voluntary and today consists of 117 partner\nagencies. Its enacts its work through a number of committees.\n68Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• The  Executive Committee, now chaired by a representative of the Danish Embassy, meets once\nmonthly as the principal policy approval forum on relief, development and security issues. It\noperates through consensus 'in which unanimity is not essential’. Although donor membership is\nunrestricted, it also includes four UN Country Team members selected by the UN Country Team\nincluding the United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD), UNPOS, three (plus or minus\none) INGO members selected by INGO Consortium. Additional invitees are allowed in accordance\nwith the agenda.\n• The Steering Committee, composed of the chairpersons of the SACB sectoral committees,\ndonors, and UN agencies, is chaired by the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator. It plays a key role\nin inter-sectoral coordination and it mandated to monitor the success of sectoral activities.\n• Sectoral Committees on health, food security, water and sanitation, education, and a fifth working\ngroup on governance chaired by the Italian ambassador, meet monthly. These all meet to discuss\nand agree action on technical issues. Many of the sectoral committee have further subcommittees\nworking on specific issues, for example, the health committee has the Cholera task force, TB\ngroup, HIV/AIDS, measles, nutrition, and a group on hospitals. Current efforts focus on forming\nstrategies for each of these sectors.\n• The  Consultative Group is open to all SACB members and the general public as a monthly forum\nfor update and information exchange. This has been established more recently than the other\nstructures with the aim to involve Somalis in Nairobi in coordination. It is chaired by a\nrepresentative of the NGO Consortium.\n• The SACB Secretariat is funded by UNDP and the EC. It organises and minutes meetings,\ndisseminates outcomes and maintains an archive of material.\n• The SACB also has a Main Body Meeting that is held when necessary to consider impact of\nmajor changes on the situation for SACB policy. The last one was held in May 1997 in Rome.\n• The  NGO Consortium consists of an executive committee and a main body involving international\nand local NGOs who elect representatives to sit on the SACB’s committees.\n• All members of the UN Country Team participate in the SACB at various levels. However, the UN\nretains a number of coordination mechanisms and structures.\n• The  UN Ccountry Team meets roughly once a month, as does its Joint Working Group – a sub-\ngroup on interagency operations that focuses on the technical or operational issues arising from\nUN Country Team discussions – and the Security Management Team.\n• The  UN Coordination Unit was established in 1997 as a UNDP project supported by OCHA; it is\nnow also funded by the Swedish government and the US Agency for International Development\n(USAID). Its budget for 2001 is $1.3m to support a proposed structures for 2001 that expands the\noffice to include five professional and three national staff who service the UN\nResident/Humanitarian Coordinator and the UN Country Team, and thus the SACB. Its functions\ninclude support to the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator, information management, data\n131\ncollection, analysis and reporting, and the promotion of common UN strategies.\nSomalia\nIn Somalia itself, coordination on the ground is more minimal. In Puntland and Somaliland,\ncoordination structures involve local authorities, including relevant line ministries.\n• In  Somaliland, the UN has a coordination Focal Point in Hargeisa, although the post has been left\nunfilled for long periods. The NGO Consortium Focal Point plays a role in coordination, while\nsecurity coordination is led by the UN Zone Security Officer. UNCIEF Regional Programme\nOfficers and UNDP Area Programme Officers are key to coordination.\n• In  Puntland, a UN Focal Point combines roles for coordination and the UNDP’s Area Programme\nOfficer, and divides her time between the administrative capital Garowe and the trading capital\nBosasso – where UNICEF has its headquarters. As in Somaliland, the NGO Consortium Focal\nPoint plays a role in coordination, while the UN Zone Security Officer leads security coordination.\n• In the south, OCHA has recently appointed a Humanitarian Affairs Officer to provide support to\ncoordination in the south and central region based in Baidoa. Hitherto, INGOs and UN agencies\nhad performed ad hoc coordination functions. Efforts to hold monthly meeting of INGOs and UN\nagencies in south and central Somalia were described as suffering from poor attendance.\nElsewhere across the south, coordination is based on the initiative of individuals and agencies in\nparticular areas. A UN Zone Security Officer has also recently been deployed.\n                                                          \n131\n However, the United Nations Coordination Unit for Somalia (UNCU) received approximately only a quarter of $1.3m last\nyear.\n69Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n3. Coordination Tools\nThe principal coordination mechanisms for Somalia are:\n• Regular meetings at all levels in Nairobi. (Field-level meetings are said to be gradually increasing\nin regularity and importance.)\n• Regular bulletins of information from the Food Security Assessment Unit, Data Management\nInformation Unit, UNCU and the SACB Secretariat.\n• Matrixes of agency activities, for example, on governance.\n• The Consolidated Appeal\n• The SACB Policy Framework for Continuing Cooperation in Somalia (drawn up since the\nestablishment of the TNG to articulate the SACB’s impartiality).\n• The SACB Operational Framework that attempts to collate sector strategies for all SACB\npartners.\n4. Good Practice\n• The SACB has engendered a habit of cooperation through regular interaction. Some of the\nSACB’s agreements attain a level of detail that suggests notable commitment to coordination on\npaper.\n• The full-time Coordinator of the health sectoral committee uses sectoral committees effectively to\nincrease the accountability of participants to agreements made through effective follow up. He\nfocuses on the field through regular travel to the field. As a former NGO worker he has managed\nto keep NGOs on board effectively. Having worked in Somalia for more than five years, he acts as\ninstitutional memory.\n•\n There appears to be less preoccupation with who should coordinate among UN agencies than in\nother complex emergencies. This relative harmony among UN agencies is variously attributed to\nthe fact that donors are watching closely, and to the role of the Resident/Humanitarian\nCoordinator in bringing people together.\n• The UNCU provides first class analysis to feed into strategy development. (However, the SACB\nmembers cannot make effective use of it in a shared strategy because contradictory interests\ndivide them).\n• A Humanitarian Analysis Group promotes discussion of the pressing challenges and disseminates\nsuccinct findings to others.\n• A secretariat function that organises meetings, takes minutes, disseminates and builds an archive\nof material that is accessible to everyone is highly valued.\n• The numerous initiatives to gather and disseminate information mean that a key coordination\nactivity is to coordinate information flows. An 'information officers group' reviews information\ninflows, though interviewees suggested that duplication remains.\n• There is systematic consultation by UNICEF staff in Nairobi of colleagues on the ground on the\npolicies being discussed within the SACB or UN Country Team.\n• There are well-coordinated/jointly implemented projects between UNICEF and WFP in Baidoa, for\nexample, UNICEF providing support in the form of medical supplies for healthcare, following WFP\nfood-for-work activities to reconstruct building for the Rabdure women's cooperative.\n• A regional exercise to stimulate pastoral networks was found to be hugely beneficial by all\nparticipants, and an indication once again of how few problems stay within borders and the\nimperative of retaining regional analysis and strategy.\n5. Weaknesses\n• The time and resources invested in the SACB are striking, but it is not clear what the impact is on\nthe ground.\n• The lack of systematic field staff consultation processes and limited transmission of information\nfrom Nairobi to the field suggests that for some activity in Nairobi has become end in itself. This is\nclearly a consequence of the lack of presence in Somalia of many organisations due to the\nsecurity situation and the realities of a ‘remote control’ cross-border operation. Those NGOs who\nare able to fly people back and forth, and (the few) UN personnel that travel regularly to the field\ndo act as important go-betweens and increase the potential for the SACB to support the field.\n• The weakness of coordination on the ground. A proposal on field coordination simply slipped off\nthe agenda despite having been stressed at the general meeting of the SACB held in Rome.\n70Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• The SACB was established to compensate for the lack of central government administration to be\nthe chief interlocutor for the aid effort. Yet the participation of Somalis in efforts to assist Somalia\nappear minimal. In the field, participation and consultation is a fraught activity involving a\ngeneration of many competing claims from local groups. The greater fluidity of the security\nsituation in the south/central region clearly makes this particularly difficult.\n• Although there are different views about the extent to which the SACB is a donor coordination\ngroup, there is agreement that the donors do not present a united front or even elements of a\ncommon strategy. At best, the SACB framework appears to have constrained one or two\nmembers from adopting a different direction from that of the other members, for example, in the\ndegree of action to recognise the TNG.\n• INGOs have the potential to influence the decisions and conduct of the SACB by virtue of its\nconsensus-based structure, but have been too donor-dependent or poorly organised to marshal\nan effective counterweight to UN agencies and donors in the SACB at the higher levels\n• Participants cite the value of a forum in which people come together and get to know each other,\nbut many interviewees stressed the importance of transparency and honesty, which implies that\nthe quality of the interactions is not satisfactory.\n• Although the SACB has the potential to be an effective peer review and accountability\nmechanism, a lack of outspokenness and activism on the part of the majority of SACB members\nmeans that problems or failings are either not raised, confronted or followed up. One result of this\nis that donors are reported to continue to fund poorly performing agencies.\n• Although in Nairobi there are agreements among all actors on rents, salaries and bonuses, these\nhave been poorly disseminated or implemented. Field staff in Baidoa were unaware of such\nefforts. In a setting where the ready availability of arms invites opportunistic threats from\nindividuals or communities who feel they have lost out in the aid effort, the absence of\ncoordination on matters such as minimum operating standards or staff salaries has security\nimplications.\n• There are a plethora of documents and agreements among and between agencies but not one\nclear strategy for action for the aid effort.\n• There has been much debate over the past few years about the appropriate political strategies\nthat the international community should adopt towards Somalia. Should the international\ncommunity focus on consolidating those areas of stability that emerge (that is, building around the\nachievements of Somaliland and Puntland to extend authority over Somalia) or on establishing a\ncentralised government for all of Somalia? Yet, since the declaration of the TNG, there has been\nlittle discussion inside the SACB structures on this.\n71Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nANNEXE 5a: KOSOVO CASE STUDY\n1. Context\nThe Kosovo crisis has consisted of at least four identifiable phases:\n• Up to 24 March 1999: the pre-bombing phase with limited IDP and refugee movements;\n• 24 March  – 13 June 1999: the major refugee exodus and international humanitarian response,\nparticularly in Albania and Macedonia;\n• 10 June 1999 – Spring 2000: the refugee return, including the humanitarian response within\nKosovo leading up to and going over the winter of 1999/2000; also increased needs within FRY\n(excluding Kosovo) for IDPs;\n• During 2000: a shift from emergency response to rehabilitation, typified by the ending of the UN\nInterim Administrative Mission (UNMIK) Humanitarian Pillar I in June 2000.\nThe Kosovo crisis up until the end of 1999 had a high level of political and media profile. The\ninternational response was typified by a plethora of agencies, ample - and sometimes too much -\nfunding, and high levels of bilateral action as governments and agencies had to be seen to be active.\nFrom 2000 onwards the focus has been on a shift from emergency response to rehabilitation and\nreconstruction, with responsibilities being taken over by the UNMIK and fledgling Kosovan\ndepartments. UNMIK has been slow to develop capacity to take over responsibilities previously\nundertaken by the humanitarian agencies.\nAt time of the case study visit (January 2001), the humanitarian response had been greatly scaled\ndown since 1999. Many of the 'hot’ issues which had been of concern during the height of the Kosovo\ncrisis, such as the coordination of an extraordinary number of humanitarian actors and the\nrelationship with, and role of the NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR), had subsided.\nKey humanitarian issues include the plight of the Serb, Roma and other minorities in Kosovo; winter\nneeds, particularly for the vulnerable still living in temporary accommodation including those whose\nhouses were completely destroyed; the possibility of IDP returns from the rest of FRY; and\npreparedness for future humanitarian needs arising from instability within and around Kosovo.\n2. Coordination Structures\nAny discussion about humanitarian coordination in the Kosovo crisis needs to specify which phase is\nbeing talked about. (This study does not deal with coordination in Albania and Macedonia which has\nbeen well documented in a variety of reviews and evaluations, notably in Suhkre et al 2000 and\nTelford 2000).\n2.1 June 1999 – June 2000:\n• UN SC Resolution 1244 enables the establishment of UNMIK, a then unprecedented structure\nwith three non-UN organisations (European Union (EU), Organisation for Security and\n132\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO KFOR) within it and led by the SRSG. The UNMIK\nstructure consisted of four pillars, each headed by a DSRSG:\nPillar I: Humanitarian Affairs (led by UNHCR)\nPillar 2: Interim Civil Administration (led by UN)\nPillar 3: Institution Building (led by OSCE)\nPillar 4: Economic Reconstruction (led by the EU)\n•\n Principal DSRSG responsible for overall coordination within UNMIK.\n• Inter-Agency Coordination Unit (IACU) is supported by and housed within UNHCR and run by\nOCHA personnel. Initially, OCHA ran twice daily meetings for the wider humanitarian community,\nfocusing on security issues.\n                                                          \n132\n From June 1999, the Acting SRSG was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Bernard Kouchner was the SRSG from July 1999 until\nJanuary 2001.\n72Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• A Humanitarian Community Information Centre (HCIC), described as an initiative of the DSRSG –\nHA, opened in August 1999 supported by OCHA, international NGOs, UNHCR and other UN\nagencies with the objective of promoting and facilitating information exchange among all\norganisations engaged in emergency and rehabilitation work in Kosovo. Originally staff included a\nKFOR liaison officer and seconded staff from agencies (including WFP, UNHCR, Catholic Relief\nServices, International Council of Voluntary Agencies, Save the Children, Organisation for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe). With the reduction of humanitarian assistance, since\nDecember 2000, HCIC staff comprise OCHA personnel and a manager seconded from Save the\nChildren.\n• A UN Development Coordinator appointed in March 2000 to ensure complementarity of efforts\nand to lay the ground for sustainable development.\n2.2 From June 2000\nChanges as a result of the ending of UNMIK Pillar I:\n• A Humanitarian Coordinator appointed for Kosovo (also UNHCR Special Envoy for FRY)\nreplacing the DSRSG – HA, continuing to attend senior UNMIK and Joint Interim Administrative\nStructure (JIAS) meetings, including morning Heads of Pillars meetings.\n• An OCHA senior humanitarian affairs officer is now head of OCHA office and Deputy\nHumanitarian Coordinator.\n• The OCHA staff and office continue to work in support of the Humanitarian Coordinator, with\nresponsibility for supervision and funding of the HCIC.\n• Regional (sub-Pristina) coordination has been increasingly transferred from UNHCR to the\nUNMIK civil administration at municipal level. UNICEF has also transferred education\ncoordination to UNMIK, but other UN agencies still lead regional coordination.\n• Sectoral Coordination: Each sector is normally led by the appropriate UN agency, although NGOs\nmay also have their own coordination meetings, for example, those involved in credit projects.\nTask or working groups have looked at specific issues such as winterisation and minorities (e.g.\nthe Ad Hoc Inter-agency Task Force on Minorities).\n• Pillar IV holds fortnightly meetings for donors to which OCHA brings humanitarian concerns.\n3. Coordination Tools\n• Inter-agency coordination meetings reflecting IASC composition are held every fortnight. OCHA\nCommunity Briefing meetings focus on broad issues, but include regular security briefing.\n• The OCHA Field Liaison Unit helps information flow in both directions between Pristina and\nregional centres, feeding into regional coordination meetings.\n• The HCIC provide a range of services including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), maps\nand the Kosovo Atlas; the CD-ROMs of the Kosovo Encyclopaedia, Housing Reconstruction\nGuidelines and HCIC Toolbox; HCIC website, hosted by ReliefWeb; a list of coordination\nmeetings, including composition, timing, who convenes etc.\n• OCHA Humanitarian Updates produced monthly.\n• The Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) led by OCHA.\n• UNDP/UNDG work on Kosovo Common Assessment, with contributions from OCHA on behalf of\nthe humanitarian agencies.\n4. Good Practice\n• Identifying gaps: Humanitarian Coordinator/OCHA/HCIC winter preparedness risk analysis survey\ncreated awareness among donors and in UNMIK of humanitarian needs for the 2000/01 winter in\n 133\nspite of the lateness of the work. Most donors and agencies had little interest in preparing for\n134\nwinter during the European summer. UNHCR had rapidly shifted out of its winter preparedness\nrole undertaken in 1999/2000. UNMIK was unprepared to take on the planning and coordination\nrole. OCHA therefore convened and chaired winter preparedness meetings attended by UN\nagencies, UNMIK departments, NGOs and donors. The Humanitarian Coordinator’s advocacy\nrole was important.\n                                                          \n133\n An important initiative, but one which was also criticised for the cumbersome nature of the survey process.\n134\n Although OFDA reported that it was pushing for work on winter preparedness during the summer of 2000.\n73Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• FAO provide an example of a well-focused strategy of coordinating and providing technical\nsupport to implementing agencies, working closely with donors to avoid duplications and advising\non funding levels. They also monitor and evaluate seed programmes. This coordination was\ndescribed by one INGO as ‘exemplary’.\n• The Humanitarian Accounting exercise in 2000 was an attempt to put more life into the Common\nHumanitarian Action Plan (CHAP)/CAP process and its mid-term review by asking each agency to\n135\nreport back on achievements and impact against objectives and constraints. It also identified\ngaps in the humanitarian effort and assisted coordination of the preparation of CAP 2001.\n• The transfer of responsibilities from UN agencies to the UNMIK civil administration structures\nworked well. For example, WFP is phasing out food distribution and shifting to a 'social case\napproach' run by the Department for Social Assistance and the Centres for Social Work. FAO is\ndevolving coordination and technical support to the Department of Agriculture.\n5. Issues\n• How do humanitarian and development agencies function when the UN is the transitional\ngovernment and the long-term status of Kosovo remains undecided?\n• Looking back to the initial phase of the emergency response in Kosovo from June 1999 onwards,\ninterviewees and reports note the calibre and skills of the senior OCHA personnel deployed,\nproviding essential coordination services. However, the team was severely under-resourced in\n136\nterms of equipment (vehicles, communications equipment, office equipment).\n• Major coordination problems in Kosovo have been less to do with inter-humanitarian agency\nrelationships and more to do with the humanitarian community’s relationships with the UNMIK\nstructures. If the traditional relief – development gap exists in Kosovo it is partly due to the\nslowness of UNMIK to take over and Kosova structures to develop and be given responsibility.\n• As part of a wider issue of using and building local capacity, efforts to include Kosovans at senior\nlevels in coordination structures have been slow to take effect.\n• Uncertainty in some quarters about the appointment and role of the Humanitarian Coordinator.\nSome interviewees were clear about the Humanitarian Coordinator’s role and UNHCR’s role,\nwhile others were not. One donor said ‘We don’t differentiate between the Humanitarian\nCoordinator and UNHCR’. It begs the question of whether UNHCR is the lead agency or not? The\nHumanitarian Coordinator argued that it is not.\n• Lack of clarity on role of head of OCHA office and relationship with the Humanitarian Coordinator\n(including role as Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator). There were no relevant up to date ToRs for\n137\neither post.\n• The absence of any public document which clearly describes the UN’s humanitarian coordination\narrangements in Kosovo after the dissolution of Pillar 1.\n• OCHA’s profile was contentious. During the Pillar 1 phase, it was subsumed within UNHCR office,\nwith no mention of its role in some Secretary-General’s reports to the Security Council. The\nblurred concept of the Humanitarian Pillar (led by UNHCR) within an Integrated UN Mission that\nwas sometimes referred to as the UNHCR pillar. UNHCR was seen by some outside the\nhumanitarian community as the sole humanitarian agency.\n• No OCHA staff member was given a proper briefing or induction, all the more important because\nof the lack of previous OCHA experience. However, one senior staff member has 20 years UN\nexperience and the other has wide Balkan experience.\n• Cooperation and liaison between the UN Humanitarian Coordinator and UN Development\nCoordinator appeared problematic.\n• Many interviewees commented on ECHO’s poor participation in coordination, due apparently to\nunder-staffing and, in the case of some meetings, instructions from Brussels.\n• During the study in Kosovo, the study team member attended three of the more than a dozen\nregular meetings organised in Pristina by UN agencies and UNMIK. These were poorly\nconducted, characterised by an absence of introductions, a failure sometimes to check on the\nlanguage favoured by participants, a failure to prohibit the use of mobile phones etc.\n• The domination of coordination meetings by international staff made it difficult for national staff to\nspeak and be heard.\n                                                          \n135\n Unfortunately this exercise did not apparently include any specific review of the effectiveness of coordination.\n136\n Vehicle procurement was reported to have taken five months.\n137\n The deputising role did not include, in practice, standing in for the Humanitarian Coordinator at UNMIK coordination\nmeetings.\n74Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n• The HCIC initiative has received much praise from UN and non-UN agencies, particularly for its\nsense of inclusiveness. Having managers with NGO backgrounds probably helped this. However\nan emphasis on neutrality has sometimes led to confusion over identity and ownership and to\nunclear relationships with the OCHA office and the Humanitarian Coordinator. HCIC could only\ncollect and disseminate information given to it – therefore it was to an extent ad hoc.\n• OCHA's lack of adequate management support to the HCIC resulted in staff uncertainties, gaps in\nstaff replacements and a subsequent interruption of services. By January 2001, some of HCIC’s\ninformation was in urgent need of updating. Its future after the transition, i.e. under whose\numbrella it should sit, was also still unclear. It is important to learn the lessons of the HCIC by\nhaving an independent evaluation.\n138\n• Duplication of GIS and other databases.\n• The sheer number of agencies working in Kosovo presented challenges for coordination. There\nwas little or no considered assessment or study of the scale and impact of this problem. In most\nemergencies, the key issue will remain the effective coordination of the major UN humanitarian\nagencies, the Red Cross / Red Crescent family and probably not more than 20 – 30 major INGOs.\nThe problem of a large number of additional small NGOs needs to be anticipated and dealt with in\nthe coordination of large-scale high-profile emergencies.\n• INGOs did not feel they were seen as full partners with UN agencies, rather implementers. They\nwere asked to contribute to CAP discussion at very late stage. On the other hand, the INGO\nCouncil could probably be more effective. ICVA has failed to replace the NGO Liaison Officer post\nwithin HCIC.\n• In spite of Civil-Military Cooperation Commission (CIMIC) initiatives and KFOR representative in\nthe HCIC, agencies have found coordination with NATO forces problematic. Information flow\ntends to be one way – to the military. ‘I get information out of KFOR in spite of the system’.  The\nnational KFOR units each have their own characteristics and approaches, and many do not see\nthe need to coordinate their humanitarian actions with the agencies. ‘They do what they think is\ngood in the morning’. An added problem is the lack of institutional memory within national units as\nthey often rotate completely every three to six months.\n• International political pressure to encourage return of Serb IDPs from FRY is a matter of deep\nconcern to some humanitarian agencies.\n• Lack of coordination and cooperation within the broad ambit of civil society. There is little contact\nbetween the INGO and Kosovar NGO groupings. OSCE has established 10 NGO resource\ncentres apparently with little liaison with the INGOs. (Relief and development are seen as\nseparate activities.)\n• There has been little work on standards or principles or gender within the humanitarian\ncommunity (although CAP 2001 has focus on women). These could have been areas of work for\nthe HCIC.\n• Lack of institutional memory – no single place where evaluations and reviews can be accessed.\n• As the political and media profile of the Kosovo crisis has decreased, so has the evaluative and\nreflective work of the humanitarian community. Very little appears to have been written about\nhumanitarian coordination in Kosovo for the period from January 2000 onwards, the humanitarian\npillar within UNMIK, its dissolution in June 2000 and the interaction between the humanitarian\n139\ncommunity and the rest of the international protectorate structures and KFOR.\n                                                          \n138\n Noted in the mission report of the ERC a.i. of 9 June 2000.\n139\n For example there appear to be no substantial reviews or evaluations of the major 1999/2000 winterisation response or the\noverall functioning and effectiveness of UNMIK.\n75Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nANNEX 5b: FRY CASE STUDY (EXCLUDING KOSOVO)\n1.  Context\nThe humanitarian focus in FRY, excluding Kosovo, has been on the Serb and Roma IDPs from\nKosovo, the overall deterioration in living conditions within FRY over recent years, exacerbated by the\nNATO bombing campaign and sanctions and the continuing caseload of refugees from earlier\nconflicts.\nHumanitarian agencies operating in FRY have to had to keep their distance from both the federal and\nSerbian authorities until October 2000. The operating context for INGOs has been very difficult, given\nno legal status and staff at times suffering harassment. There has not been a flood of agencies into\nFRY since the fall of the Milosevic government. The small number of agencies relative to Kosovo has\nmade coordination less of a challenge in Belgrade.\n2. Coordination Structures\n• Humanitarian Coordinator for FRY (excluding Kosovo), Resident Coordinator a.i. and UNICEF\nSpecial Representative for FRY (including Kosovo).\n• OCHA office headed by Senior Humanitarian Affairs Officer who is also Deputy Humanitarian\nCoordinator for FRY, excluding Kosovo.\n• UN Liaison Office providing the UN’s political representation.\n• Humanitarian aid coordination forum for donors/diplomats, attended by Humanitarian\nCoordinators and UN agencies.\n• Sectoral coordination meetings led by the relevant UN agencies.\n3. Coordination Tools\n• Weekly Heads of Agencies coordination meetings chaired by the Humanitarian Coordinator,\nservice by OCHA with an IASC membership (NGOs represented by ICVA) and including the Head\nof the UN Liaison Office. ‘The Heads of Agencies meeting works well – exactly as it should be’\n(Head of agency)\n• OCHA Weekly Situation Reports.\n• OCHA Humanitarian Risk Analysis reports, produced in conjunction with the UN and other\nagencies.\n• Overviews of UN Humanitarian Activities.\n• OCHA Podgorica produced surveys including one a household income and expenditure survey.\n• OCHA in both Belgrade and Podgorica producing humanitarian operations databases.\n• The CAP led by OCHA.\n• The ICVA Directory of Humanitarian and Development Agencies in FRY (June 2000).\n4. Good Practice\n• Humanitarian Coordinator’s role is clearly delineated from UNICEF’s operation in Serbia and\nMontenegro. UNICEF is not seen as a lead agency.\n• OCHA’s Humanitarian Risk Analysis reports are much appreciated.\n• OCHA’s work on the energy situation in FRY is seen as an important area not being covered by\nother agencies.\n• Handover of the OCHA sub-office in Podgorica to the UNDP liaison office in February 2001\nfollowing the signing of a joint Memoranda of Understanding (MoU).\n• The integrity and effectiveness of the Yugoslav Red Cross has been a major issue, about which\nthe agencies have collaborated constructively.\n• Good collaboration over monitoring the sensitive situation in Southern Serbia and mounting an\ninter-agency assessment mission in February 2001.\n76Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\n5. Issues\n• ICVA has played an important role and represents NGOs at fortnightly heads of agencies\nmeeting, but there is some concern about the flow of information to and from those meetings to\nthe NGOs.\n• Some interviewees, particularly from INGOs, felt that OCHA could have made more use of the\ndata and information which it has collected and were sometimes unaware of how the information\nhas been used.\n• The transition from a mainly humanitarian response to one of reconstruction facilitated by moves\nsuch as the OCHA field office coordination responsibilities being handed over to UNDP and the\nUNDP officer in charge in Belgrade leading an inter-agency assessment mission to Presovo in\nSouthern Serbia in February 2001.\n6. Regional Issues\n• This study was not able to make a full assessment of regional coordination in South East Europe.\nIn relation to Kosovo there appeared to be considerable “cross-border” coordination over the\nsensitive Presovo region in south east Serbia, particularly between the Humanitarian\nCoordinators in Pristina and Belgrade. The fact that both Humanitarian Coordinators have\nregional envoy roles within their respective organisations has fostered regional perspectives.\nHowever, it was not clear whether there were adequate international coordination structures in\nplace in order to build and maintain a comprehensive regional analysis. At least one senior official\nin the region was scathing about the absence of such regional mechanisms.\n• Different definition of regions in each organisation.\n• Tension between the political pressure to encourage the return of Serbs to Kosovo in order to\ndemonstrate the existence of a multi-ethnic international protectorate and the humanitarian space\nneeded to provide effective protection for them.\n• The CAP for South Eastern Europe is said to provide the only formal instrument that brings\nagencies together on a regional basis.\n• There have been few studies and evaluations of the Kosovo crisis that have taken a\ncomprehensive regional (Balkan) perspective including the whole of FRY, so there is little written\nabout the nature of regional humanitarian coordination.\n77Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nANNEXE 6: LIST OF INTERVIEWEES\n NEW YORK\nUN\nAgnes Asekenye-Oonyu, Chief, Africa Section, OCHA\nOmar Bakhet, Director, Emergency Response Division, UNDP\nMartin Barber, Director a.i., Policy Development and Advocacy Branch, OCHA\nDominique Burgeon, Operations Officer, TCOR, Field Operations Division, FAO\nMargaret Carey, Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary-General for Peace-Keeping Operations\nRobert Carr, Project Officer, Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF\nLance Clark, Policy, Advocacy and Information Department, OCHA\nChris Coleman, Chief, Policy and Analysis Unit, DPKO\nKelly David Toweh, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, OCHA\nShamsul Farooq, Chief, Humanitarian Response, Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF\nBradley Foerster, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, IASC/ECHA Secretariat, OCHA\nDr. Kingsley Gee, Senior Advisor on Health Policy, WHO\nSteve Gleason, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, OCHA\nDavid Hannah, DPKO\nPeter Hornsby, Logistics Officer, DPKO\nNils Kastberg, Director, Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF\nKevin Kennedy, Chief, Emergency Liaison Branch, OCHA\nRashid Khalikov, Officer-in-Charge, IASC Secretariat, OCHA\nDr. Atul Khare, Counsellor, Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations\nPhylis Lee, Chief, Advocacy and External Relations, OCHA\nIain Levine, Chief, Humanitarian Policy Development, Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF\nAlexandre Matsouka, Political Affairs Officer, UN DPA\nMarta Mauras, Director, Office of the Deputy Secretary-General\nCarolyn McAskie, Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i., OCHA\nJamie McGoldrick, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, Emergency Liaison Branch, OCHA\nDavid McLachlan-Karr, Chief a.i., Asia/Europe/Latin America Section, Emergency Liaison Branch,\nOCHA\nYohannes Mengesha, Principal Officer, Office of the Deputy Secretary-General\nMichael Møller, Principal Officer, Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs\nMr. Mochida, Desk Officer for Somalia, UN DPA\nHawaa El-Tayeb Musa, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, DPKO\nRobert Piper, Deputy Director, Emergency Response Division, UNDP\nRamesh Rajasingham, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, Policy, Advocacy and Information Division,\nOCHA\nYasser Sabra, Desk Officer for DRC, UN DPA\nEmma Shitaka, DPKO (Kosovo)\nMichael Smith, UNDP\nHansjoerg Strohmeyer, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, OCHA\nPeter Swarbrick, DPKO\nEd Tsui, Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator a.i., OCHA\nGeoff Wiffin, Project Officer, Office of Emergency Programmes, UNICEF\n GENEVA\nUN\nWilliam Barriga, Emergency Officer, Emergency and Post-Conflict Division, IOM\nDavid Bassiouni, Coordinator, IASC/ECHA Secretariat, OCHA\nJoel Boutroue, OCHA\nPeter de Clerq, Head of Desk, Great Lakes Operation, UNHCR\nThierry Delbreuve, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, Complex Emergency Response Branch, OCHA\nSteven Gleason, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, Emergency Liaison Branch, OCHA\nDavid Harland, OCHA\nMerete Johansson, Chief of Section 3, Complex Emergency Response Branch, OCHA\nArjun Katoch, Chief, Field Coordination Support Unit, Disaster Response Branch, OCHA\nBrian Keane, Head of Georgia Office, OCHA\nPirkko Kourula, Head, Secretariat Service and Inter-Organization Affairs, UNHCR\n78\n  Humanitarian Coordination: Lessons from Recent Field Experience\nJeff Labovitz, Emergency Response Officer, Emergency and Post-Conflict Division, IOM\nXavier Leus, Director EHA, WHO\nPablo Mateu, Senior Inter-Organization Officer, UNHCR\nDennis McNamara, Special Coordinator for IDPs\nRoss Mountain, Assistant Emergency Relief Coordinator, OCHA\nSoren Jensen Peterson, UNHCR\nMarco Roggia, Senior External Relations Officer, New York Desk, UNHCR\nStephen Tull, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, Complex Emergency Response Branch, OCHA\nCatherine Walker, Head of Desk for East Asia and the Pacific, UNHCR\nNeill Wright, Head of Desk, Kosovo;

          "The Wellcome Trust\nSocial, Ethics and Public Policy Research on Biomedical Science\nResearch Summary\nTitle: Social and Ethical Aspects of Governing Dual-Use Biomedical Research\nand Development\nInvestigator: Filippa Corneliussen\nInstitution: Institute for the Study of Genetics, Biorisks and Society (IGBiS),\nUniversity of Nottingham\nType of grant: Research Fellowship\nTime period (in months): 36\nStart date: 1 October 2003\nBackground\nMuch of the technology used in biomedical R&D is as applicable to biological warfare as to the\npromotion of human well-being and economic development. The potential misuse of civilian research\nand the dual-use nature of biomedical R&D have been particularly highlighted in the wake of\nSeptember 11 and the ensuing anthrax attacks. Bioweapons and the control of dual-use technology is\nnow a major policy issue.\nBiotechnology is most intensively exploited in commercial enterprises. It is also where duality is most\nambivalent. One of the main policy fears is that these private firms, if unmonitored, might be party to\nexternal or domestic transfers where dual-use biomedical knowledge and technology fall into the\nwrong hands.\nAims\nThe aim of this study is to empirically investigate the way in which social, ethical and legal principles\nshape the governance of dual-use technology and assess their effectiveness in regulating the behaviour\nof private firms.\nMethodology\nThe project will be a comparative study of the UK and the US using qualitative methods. The design of\nthe project is based on three workpackages:\n1. The first workpackage examines the ethical principles and social objectives that have been\ndeveloped to guide national and international policy in this area and looks at how these have been\ntranslated into proposals for the governance of dual-use technology. It investigates national and\ninternational policy developments on dual-use governance resulting from September 11 and\nensuing events. The workpackage mainly involves: a) documentary analysis of regulative measures,\nreports and working papers, and NGO publications; and b) interviews with UK and US\npolicymakers and NGOs.2. The second workpackage explores the impact of control measures for dual-use technologies on firm\nbehaviour and industry competitiveness. This part of the project mainly involves: a) documentary\nanalysis of industry associations' reports and statements, reports/publications on the impact of the\nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on the chemical industry, and NGO publications; and b)\ninterviews with UK and US biomedical companies working on a spread of dual-use technologies\nand with biomedical and chemical trade associations.\n3. The third workpackage considers the effectiveness of an inspection regime to oversee dual-use\nbiomedical technologies in the private sector. This is explored through: a) documentary analysis of\nbiological weapons inspection reports, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n(OPCW) publications, reports and statements, and NGO publications; and b) interviews with\nUNSCOM and Trilateral inspectors and with members of the UK CWC National Authority and\nCWC inspectors from OPCW.\nMain research questions\n• What social and ethical principles have guided the form of the regulatory framework governing\ndual-use technologies and how have they been enshrined in law?\n• How might such a framework impact on the behaviour of firms and the competitiveness of the\nbiotechnology industry and what are the main barriers to ensuring compliance?\n• How can effective enforcement measures be developed to regulate the private sector?\n• How can ethical guidelines, professional codes and public policy be further developed to achieve an\neffective framework regulating the private development of dual-use biomedical technologies?\nApplications of research results\nThe project will map out an acceptable and practicable framework for public policy to manage the\ngovernance of dual-use biomedical R&D.\nFurther information\nName: Filippa Corneliussen\nAddress: Institute for the Study of Genetics, Biorisks and Society (IGBiS), Law and Social Sciences\nBuilding, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK\nTel: +44 (0)115 846 7173\nFax: +44 (0)115 846 6349\nEmail: lqxfc@nottingham.ac.uk\n"]},

In third place has been the word \"cooperation\", especially from my distinguished colleague, Mr Kirkhope, who used it no less than 11 times in his striking speech to the Convention yesterday and whose alternate I am today.\n\n\n\nThe traditions, the histories, the electoral systems and constitutional powers of the national parliaments of the Member States are as varied as the architectures of their buildings. One could indulge in some rather fancy analogies but I will resist the temptation. However, they all have three things in common: they are representative, democratically elected and hold the executive to account to a greater or lesser degree. These three foundations are the bedrock on which our democratic freedoms are built.\n\n\n\nAlone among the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliaments has any claim to such foundations but it has only limited power to hold the executive to account and will remain that way until co-decision becomes the rule. So, in my view, until such time as my Parliament, if I may be so bold as to call it that, is granted such power - if ever - it will remain the national parliaments that protect our democratic freedoms. I would be concerned if that were to change.\n\n\n\nI am also concerned that this Convention, in a genuine desire to improve and simplify the institutions and workings of the Union, will try to force the many and variously shaped pegs of our parliamentary democratic traditions into one round integrationist whole. Thus losing, I believe, the support and confidence of our citizens. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, our national parliaments and their distinguished representatives here should not be complacent. They should ask themselves whether their institution really fulfils the roles that it is meant to. Is it truly representative? How far do party considerations affect the democratic will of the people? Above all, does it hold the executive genuinely to account?\n\n\n\nNearly all of us in this room have had first-hand experience of our national parliaments, but can we honestly say that our parliament is perfect? If it was, I daresay that we, as politicians, would be less happy with it. It is right that we have spoken of subsidiarity and flexibility so often. In this Convention, while we consider the relationship of the European institutions to our national parliaments, I trust that these words will not sound hollow to the very people we stand to represent. \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t Send to a friend \t Print\tAbout The Earl of Stockton MEP >>\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t RELATED NEWS\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tUK named and shamed for failure to fight flu threat\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tHoon 'new agenda' on Europe speech is the last of three Labour u-turns on Europe\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tQaddafi's rehabilitation threatened by Libyan witch-hunt against imprisoned Bulgarian Nurses\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tLiberal Democrats anti-US assault fails\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\tUK defence security threatened by EU naivety on giving public access to maps\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n    \t\n\t\t\n    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t \tAlso in the news \n\t \tNewsroom\n\t \tNews headlines\n\t \tSpeeches\n\t \tMultimedia\n\t \tBlogs\n\t \tRecent press releases\n\t \tArticles\n\t \tLocal Govt.

It also\nincludes a \"Definitions\" sidebar to help readers understand some of the\nvariety of the transgender experience.\nIn addition to the special focus on transgender concerns, The Other\nSide's May-June issue also includes feature articles by Daniel Berrigan on\nmilitarism and the Psalms, Kate Farrell on finding\nJesus in the eyes of strangers, Robert Gamble on encounters at the\nmargins, John Alexander on the hazards of \"consequentialism,\" and\nDoug Davidson on the death penalty.\n\nReview copies of the May-June 2001 issue of The Other Side will be\navailable to the press beginning in mid-April 2001.  Discounts are available\nfor bulk orders.\n\nThe Other Side (http://www.theotherside.org) is an independent and\necumenical Christian publication advancing a healing Christian vision that\nis biblical and compassionate, appreciative of the creative arts, and\ncommitted to the intimate intertwining of personal spirituality and social\ntransformation.\n\nAvailable by subscription only ($24 per year in the U.S. for 6 bimonthly\nissues).  Call 1-800-700-9280 or email outreach@theotherside.org for more\ninformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPrev by Date:\nFw: UK - When a man becomes a woman...

The more people that can 'Come Out' and say 'I have suffered too or sometimes each day can be a struggle', or have an ongoing illness, I believe 1 in 4 will eventually become 1 in 1 as we all suffer to a greater or lesser degree during a life time.\n\n\n\n\nBack To The Message List\n\n\n\n     \t\t\n\n \n\n\n \n © Mental Health Foundation.

The inscriptions \n  consist of the names of people and gods plus a few other words and \n  were inscribed during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.\n\n\nBasque first appeared in writing in Latin religious texts, the \n  Glosas Emilianenses, dating from the 11th century. The \n  first published book in Basque was a collection of poems entitled \n  Linguae Vasconum Primitiae, published by Bernard Detchepare \n  in 1545.\n\n\nFor centuries there was no standard orthography, and Basque was written\n  with Romance spelling conventions supplemented by various additional\n  devices to represent sounds not present in Romance languages. During\n  the early years of the 20th century, a bizarre and impractical orthography\n  employing a blizzard of pointless diacritics was widely used; this largely\n  disappeared after the Spanish Civil War. In 1964 the Royal Basque Language\n  Academy (Euskaltzaindia) promulgated a new standard orthography; this\n  met some resistance at first but is now almost universally used.\n\n\nBasque alphabet & pronunciation\n\n\n\n\nSample text\n\nGizon-emakume guztiak aske jaiotzen dira, duintasun eta eskubide berberak\n  dituztela; eta ezaguera eta kontzientzia dutenez gero, elkarren artean\n  senide legez jokatu beharra dute.\n\n\nTranslation\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Juan Pablo Moris, Rodolfo Samaniego, Ana Gil, David Vilela and Carlos Tortosa were all there, and will be buried today.\n\nBut the most tragic door of all contained the names of a father and son, Francisco and Jorge Fernández, aged 52 and 22. \"They would have been sitting side-by-side as they always did,\" said a close family friend, Jesús Laroda.\n\n\nA couple of metres away from them, during the ride towards Madrid, lay a rucksack containing a bomb reportedly made up of explosives, a detonator, a mobile phone to activate it and surrounded by screws meant to act as shrapnel.\n\n\n\"They did the same every day, catching the 7.15 train together. Jorge would look at his study notes as they travelled. Francisco was a trade union official who worked in a banking organisation,\" Mr Laroda said. \"The bomb must have been close to them, it would have been quick.\"\n\n\n\"Francisco was a much-loved man, a union organiser who did a lot for people,\" he said. \"His two elder daughters, who are in their 20s, and his three-year-old boy have lost both a father and a brother.\"\n\n\n\"His wife Maribel is in a very bad way. It was his second marriage and they had spent eight good years together,\" he said.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted by Norm at 05:18 PM | Permalink\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRecent Posts\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPlatform four\n\tExplaining belief\n\tLike screaming in a dream\n\tJunebug\n\tJust people talking\n\tAaro marathon\n\tMobile solidarity\n\tRemember them\n\tMelbourne in Manchester\n\tThe run stealers\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHouse\n\n\t\n\t\t\tBest UK Blog - Weblog Awards 2005\n\n\tEye of the Norm\n\n\tEye of the Norm 2\n\n\tI of the Norm\n\n\tWife of the Norm\n\n\tWritings\n\n\tx-normblog (the old place)\n\n\ty-Technorati profile\n\n\ty-Truth Laid Bear (Large Mammal)\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tArchives\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tApril 2006\n\tMarch 2006\n\tFebruary 2006\n\tJanuary 2006\n\tDecember 2005\n\tNovember 2005\n\tOctober 2005\n\tSeptember 2005\n\tAugust 2005\n\tJuly 2005\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLinks\n\n\t\n\t\t\tA Gauche\n\tA.

Following on from the recommendations of the Transforming Youth Work Warwick Conference in 2002 the Workforce Development Implementation Group worked on the next phase. Its report was welcomed by Margaret Hodge, Minister for Children and Young People.  \nYou can download a copy of the full report  and the executive summary    \nThe NYA has produced guidelines and self-assessment framework to help organisations providing youth work services to create a workforce development policy and seek NYA accreditation.  An accredited workforce development policy is now one of the recognised characteristics of a good quality youth service, in line with the Government's Resourcing Excellent Youth Services agenda.  Guidelines for Development and Accrediting a Workforce Development Policy in a Youth Work Organisation are available from the NYA Quality Standards Team priced at £30 + VAT.  For further information contact Ann Wilson or Diane Evans - NYA Quality Standards Team.  \nRefining the Youth Work Standards and Performance Indicators\nThe NYA continues to work with DfES in sharpening the standards and targets in REYS, making sure they match up with each other and improving their practical usage.  More information is available on:\n\tCredit Where It s Due Benchmark and FAQs\n\nYSQM Quality Mark for Services for Young People\nThe YSQM is primarily a self-assessment tool, which can be used by any organisation as a means to quality improvement.  There was a demand from those involved in its development for a National Award for those organisations, which reach the required standard. Having worked through the self-assessment, organisations will be eligible for the National Award if they have gained an Established or Advanced score in each of the 11 standards, therefore achieving the standard.\nOrganisations can seek accreditation by registering for the National Award and submitting their self-assessment to be checked at The National Youth Agency and assigned to an YSQM Consultant who will act as Assessor in the accreditation process.  The Quality Standards Committee will make the final decision on granting a National Award.  View the list of QSC members.\n\tVisit the Quality Mark website.\n\nFAQs about Quality Mark\nWe've tried to give some answers to many of the questions people frequently ask us to do with youth work training, qualifications and professional development on the frequently asked questions part of The NYA site. \nMembers and contact details of the Quality Standards Team are set out on The NYA staff list - go to About the NYA.\nLADS (Learning and Developing Skills) Project\n\n\n\tCase Study Details\n\tNature of Provision\n\tOutcomes of Work\n\tMeasuring Effectiveness\n\tPartnerships/Multi-Disciplinary Working\n\tStrategic Impact\n\tContact Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Back   Back to Top\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSection Sublinks\n\n\tQuality Standards including Partners in Innovation\n\tQuality Research Report\n\tPartners in Innovation\n\tQuality Mark Website\n\tYSQM - an introduction\n\tYSQM - Background information\n\tThe Self-assessment process\n\tYSQM Information and Briefings\n\tHow to subscribe to the Self-assessment\n\tYSQM National Award process\n\tHow to register for the National Award\n\tYSQM subscribers\n\tYSQM Regional Training Programme\n\tYSQM Assessors\n\tQuality Standards Committee\n\tNational Award Holders\n\tContact the Team\n\n\n\n\n\t\tNYA partner sites\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n     \t\n\tEastgate House, 19-23 Humberstone Road, Leicester LE5 3GJ. \n\n\tTel: 0116 242 7350 Fax 0116 242 7444\n\n\tEmail: nya@nya.org.uk\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\t\t | \n\tDisclaimer Information\n\t\t | \n\tAccessibility\n\t\t | \n\tCopyright Statement\n\t\t | \n\tStaff Login\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t",

But so far few hard facts have been known as to whether rising debt levels are associated with growing arrears of debt, and whether families are facing increasing difficulties in paying off these debts.\n \n\nResearch published in the forthcoming March issue of Fiscal Studies shows that the debt problem is a little different from that portrayed in some parts of the media: consumer debt is expanding rapidly on the back of a growth in real living standards and rising house prices but it is not homeowners who face difficulties in paying back debt; rather it is people with low incomes, typically without a job or their own property, who report problems with debt arrears.  Moreover, the  focus on credit card debt in the media ignores that fact that families use a great variety of sources of credit, including catalogues, store cards and mail order, and that arrears on some of these credit sources are much more prevalent among families with children than arrears on credit cards.\n \n\nThis research uses a large representative sample of single parents and of low-income couples with children (with incomes up to 35% above the Family Credit ceiling) to examine access to credit and arrears on debt.  The sample covers those families most likely to get into difficulties.  The sample is 'tracked' in subsequent years through the Family and Children Survey, which also expands the sample to be representative of all families with children.\n\n\nThe paper focuses on five areas of household finances where problems of arrears and default might arise. These are credit-financed purchases, loans from financial organisations (ranging from banks to local moneylenders), loans from family, and arrears arising from non-payment for housing and for utilities. The primary focus of this analysis is on the first wave of the data (collected in 1999), although the authors also carry out some simple analysis of persistence in the use of particular forms of credit and, in particular, in the persistence of default and arrears (using data from tracking the sample in 2000 and 2001).\n\n\nThe research, by Sarah Bridges and Richard Disney (University of Nottingham), reveals strikingly different patterns of debt between one-parent families and low-income couples with children, and between tenants and homeowners.\n\n\nKey findings include:\n\n\n\tThere were striking differences in credit use (other than mortgages) between homeowners and tenants. 57% of home-owning couples and 54% of home-owning single parents were using credit cards or store cards, as opposed to 19% of tenant couples and 13% of tenant single parents. \n\n\n\tHomeowners are roughly twice as likely as tenants to use bank loans and overdrafts. They are also more likely to have bank accounts in the first place. This could be because these types of credit are more readily available to home owners.\n\n\n\tConversely, catalogues and mail-order schemes were used more by tenants than by home-owners. Roughly 1 in 20 tenants face problems in repaying debt incurred through catalogue and mail-order schemes.\n\n\n\tInformal sources of loans (friends and family) were used by roughly one in six families, especially tenants and lone parents. Default rates were high for all types of families for informal loans and for loans from moneylenders.\n\n\n\t12% of home-owning couples and 13% of home-owning single parents were having difficulties keeping up payments on loans from financial institutions or moneylenders, as opposed to 22% of tenant couples and 25% of tenant single parents. This seems to contradict the proposition that homeowners are more likely to default because they can borrow larger amounts, using the house as collateral. The more likely explanation is that problems of debt arise from low incomes, rather than from 'irresponsible lending' to homeowners by high-street institutions. \n\n\n\tOver 40% of lone parents and 30% of low-income couples with children are behind with bills for various household utilities and services.\n\n\n\tGiven that renters are typically poorer than owner-occupiers and less likely to be in stable employment, it is not surprising to find that the incidence of rent arrears (34%) is much greater than that of mortgage arrears (9%).\n\n\n\tOlder respondents are associated with lower amounts of arrears. However, every extra child raises the average amount of arrears by £57 for couples and £75 for single parents. \n\n\n\tIn terms of family income, having access to housing and disability benefits tended to reduce arrears, although 'other benefits' were associated with an increase. \n\n\n\tThere is evidence, particularly among single parents, that working increases average arrears - presumably because work is associated with greater access to credit arrangements and/or because work involves expenses. However, once people are in work, higher earnings significantly reduce arrears. \n\n\n\tPeople with higher levels of qualifications, which are usually associated with higher incomes, had lower levels of arrears. \n\n\n\n\nThe results suggest that low-income families indeed utilise a variety of credit arrangements, with greater use of catalogues and mail-order schemes, relative to credit cards, and loans from sources other than high-street banks, relative to the population as a whole. This may illustrate constraints on access to normal 'high-street credit', but such families may also choose other sources of credit for a number of reasons that are unrelated to access. For example, temporary non-payment of regular bills such as utility bills, or loans from relatives, may be a less costly alternative to bank loans or credit cards as a means of financing current expenditures.\n\n\nPersistence of arrears was found to be greatest in dealings with local authorities - through levy of council tax and possibly local authority renting - along with mortgage lenders and water utilities (who face legal limitations on their ability to cut off non-payers), but the annual rates of persistence are rather low. The figures (in the attachment) illustrate this.  In addition, the pattern of arrears suggests that low income families utilise categories of credit arrangements where they can engage in some negotiation over payment of arrears and where interest is typically not charged on overdue amounts. There is also some evidence of rotation of arrears on utility bills - that is, switching between providers of different utilities in non-payment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t  Ends \n\n\n\nNotes to editors\n\n\n\tThe article, by Richard Disney (Experian Centre for Economic Modelling, School of Economics, University of Nottingham and Institute for Fiscal Studies) and Sarah Bridges (Experian Centre for Economic Modelling, School of Economics, University of Nottingham) is published in the March issue of Fiscal Studies, (2004) vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 1-25.

It was intended \n  to be action research with the aim of producing models of advance statements, \n  which are empowering and beneficial for all involved in mental health care.\n\nThe project examined a range of different models of advance directives, advance \n  statements and crisis plans to evaluate how best they might fit alongside care \n  plans or the Care Programme Approach. The aim was to develop models of good \n  practice, with guidelines and materials for practical implementation.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of the project were to:\n\n\traise consciousness of advance statements and their potential benefits \n\tprovide training in the use of advance statements and supporting information \n    to staff within Bradford and Airedale Care Trust \n\tmake a draft copy of an advance statement form with guidelines and supporting \n    information available to service users in the area via Advance Statement Workshops \n  \n\n\n \n  Back to the top\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Research and Policy Briefing\n\n\t  \n\n\tAdvance Statements in Mental Health.\n Updates: Volume 4, Issue 4, October 2002.\n\n\n \n  Back to the top\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n  The information on this page was provided by staff from the Mental Health Foundation.\n\n   \n  It was last updated on \n  29 June, 2005\n  \n\n  \nBack to the top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\tContact Us\n   |   Keep Up To Date  |   About This Site  |   \n\n\tLegal Notices\n   |   Designed By Nemisys\n\n© Mental Health Foundation.
