This report is about the way Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, an executive agency within the National \nAssembly for Wales, seeks to protect and conserve the built heritage in Wales. It focusses on two main themes: the \nprogress which Cadw has made in listing historic buildings and scheduling ancient monuments, and on how Cadw \nis maximising the benefits obtained from grants made for the repair and upkeep of historic buildings, including the \nfunds which Cadw has made available to the National Trust for Chirk Castle. 2. In preparing this report we took evidence from Cadw (Annex A) on the basis of a report by the Auditor General \nfor Wales (1). We also received written evidence from the National Trust(2) (Annex B). We also publish with this \nreport Cadw's response to our request for a statement of the specific financial impacts and efficiency savings and \nother improvements which will be to the long-term benefit of Cadw arising from this work by the Auditor General \nfor Wales(3) (Annex C). Finally, we would like to place on record our appreciation of the positive and constructive \nmanner in which Cadw responded to Members' questions during the Committee's first evidence session. We hope \nthat this will set the manner and tone for future evidence sessions. \n3. In this report we look at the three main topics that emerged from our examination: \n     the steps Cadw has taken to protect the built heritage of Wales; \n     how Cadw maximises the benefits obtained from grants made for the repair of historic buildings in Wales; \nand \n     Cadw's contribution to the cost of running Chirk Castle. \nWe then set out our main findings and conclusions together with a series of recommendations intended to help \nCadw further improve its performance and achieve efficiency savings, thus releasing resources for other tasks. \nPROTECTING THE BUILT HERITAGE \n4. Wales has some 3,000 scheduled monuments and some 22,000 listed historic buildings. Most of these properties \nare owned privately and their care and preservation depend on the efforts of owners and voluntary and private sector \norganisations. The National Assembly supports this work with a range of grants and other assistance(4). Cadw's \nwork forms a key element of this support and, in 1998-99, the net cost of Cadw's activities was £10.8 million(5). \n5. Cadw is responsible for maintaining up-to-date statutory lists of buildings of special historic interest. The existing \nlists are inadequate by modern standards. As a result, there are some 10,000 or more buildings of special interest in \nWales that do not currently enjoy the statutory protection that they deserve, whereby they may not be altered or \ndemolished without prior approval(6). Cadw is undertaking a systematic resurvey of the whole of Wales conducted \non a community basis by contractors. At 31 March 1999, Cadw had resurveyed 397 of the 867 communities and \nthere were 22,308 listed buildings in Wales(7). The resurvey is on track for completion by 2005(8). \n6. The Auditor General for Wales reported from his test examination that 14 buildings which should have been \nidentified for listing by contractors undertaking resurveys had been missed. This problem had largely arisen because \ncontractors had failed to gain entrance to the interiors of the buildings and had not followed guidance to draw this to \nCadw's notice. Cadw has reissued guidance to contractors drawing this particular point to their attention and will \nundertake the check recommended by the Auditor General for Wales of spot listed buildings in resurveyed areas to \nmonitor contractors' performance(9). \n7. Local planning authorities are primarily responsible for the protection of listed buildings threatened by \ndevelopment or neglect. Their consent is required by law for the demolition of a listed building or for any alteration \nor extension which would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest. Local \nplanning authorities are required to notify Cadw of all listed building consent applications they propose to grant, \nexcept those which affect only the interior of a grade II listed building(10). \n8. In England, listed building consent applications for grade II buildings that do not involve major demolition are \nllldetermined by local planning authorities(11). This policy has not been adopted in Wales on the grounds that the 25 \nlocal planning authorities lack the heritage expertise they would need to enable Cadw to make this delegation. Cadw \nis seeking to address the deficit in heritage expertise that still exists between England and Wales by creating and \nsupporting a built heritage forum to meet and discuss with local planning authorities areas of common interest and \nby working with them closely on a number of initiatives. Cadw considers that any decision to delegate \nstraightforward listed building consent applications should not be a blanket delegation to all local planning \nauthorities in Wales, but limited to those authorities that have the necessary expertise(12). \n9. At 31 March 1999, there were 3,155 scheduled ancient monuments in Wales. Broadly speaking, they rank in \nimportance with the two highest grades of listed buildings, which apply to only eight per cent of the listed buildings \nin Wales. Cadw's approach to scheduling monuments is not through a geographical survey, but by a rolling \nprogramme focussed on specified monument types throughout Wales. Certain monument types and areas of Wales \nare under-represented on the existing schedule, and the number of scheduled monuments should increase by nearly \ndouble to some 5,700 in total. But the need for primary fieldwork to precede scheduling means that the schedule is \nlikely to remain incomplete for over 20 years(13). \n10. While Cadw would prefer to find and schedule monuments, those that are not discovered at the moment have \nthe protection of concealment. Cadw considers that there needs to be a compromise between the ideal and the \naffordable. It does have an inspector dedicated to scheduling and it will have identified and scheduled most of the \nbetter-known monuments within five to seven years(14). \n11. Cadw makes grants towards the cost of the repair of historic buildings. In 1998-99, Cadw made 97 offers of \nbuilding grants totalling some £2.42 million. With the exception of Cadw makes grants towards the cost of the \nrepair of historic buildings. In 1998-99, Cadw made 97 offers of building grants totalling some £2.42 million. With \nthe exception of Cadw makes grants towards the cost of the repair of historic buildings. In 1998-99, Cadw made 97 \noffers of building grants totalling some £2.42 million. With the exception of Cathedrals, Cadw has not specifically \ntargeted grant expenditure at particular categories of buildings or recipients and applications have not been ranked \nin order of merit. Cadw proposes to restructure the current scheme by setting up a number of sub-schemes covering \ndifferent categories of buildings and recipients, including buildings at risk, and to assess and score grant \napplications against separate criteria for each scheme(15). \n12. Cadw notifies grant applicants by letter of the decision reached on their application. However, it does not have a \nformal mechanism, particularly for unsuccessful applicants, to explain how decisions were reached. Cadw accepts it \nhas a responsibility to explain its decision-making process and will consider what improvements are required(16). \nCadw told us that, in considering grant applications, it is very alert to buildings at risk that come to its attention and \nthese are given priority. It has encouraged applications for certain buildings at risk, although it accepts it has more \nto do in this area(17). \n13. Cadw takes the view that buildings at risk registers should be compiled by local authorities with its help, in the \nform of an offer of 50 per cent funding for this work. Eight local surveys have been completed. There may be \naround 200 to 250 listed buildings at risk in real dereliction in Wales, but this is very much an estimate. Cadw \ncannot say when a register covering the whole of Wales will be completed, as this depends on when local \nauthorities accept its offer of funding support(18). A buildings at risk register was launched in England in May 1997\n(19). \nGRANT CONDITIONS 14. Cadw requires recipients to agree to a number of standard conditions attached to grants. These include \nconditions concerning insurance, public access and claw-back of the grant on disposal. Cadw had applied these \nconditions for 10 years from the date on which the grant offer is accepted. Cadw accepts and has implemented the \nrecommendation made by the Auditor General for Wales to apply grant conditions from the date of payment(21). \n15. The Auditor General for Wales reported that Cadw had not monitored whether owners were complying with \ngrant conditions in all cases where conditions still apply and that the monitoring system was not effective. In some \ncases monitoring action had been overlooked, or there had been difficulties in obtaining satisfactory responses from \nowners which had not been resolved(22). Cadw has now addressed these weaknesses in its monitoring system, \nwhich arose from staff shortages, and it will extend the system to cover all cases when the necessary computer \nsystem, planned for next year, is in place(23). \n16. The Auditor General for Wales identified one case of a grant recipient who had sold his property in October \n1998 without notifying Cadw and where, under the claw-back condition, the recipient would be required to repay \nsome £58,500(24). Cadw had been given notice in November 1997 of the owner's intention to sell this property and \ntold us that it could not justify the delay in taking effective action on this case. The grant recipient has now been \ntraced and legal action is underway to recover sums due. Cadw has since introduced new procedures in cases where \nattempts to contact owners are unsuccessful and will, as recommended by the Auditor General for Wales, check \nownership with the Land Registry in similar circumstances. Cadw acknowledges that the problems encountered in \nthis case would have been prevented if recovery of grant had been made the subject of a legal charge or a local land \ncharge, as recommended by the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee in 1993. It is considering taking a \nlegal charge on properties as part of its restructuring of the current grant scheme(25) (referred to in paragraph 11 \nabove). In addition we pointed out to Cadw that there may be other options for strengthening the legal protection of \nits interest in these properties. \n17. Cadw has only recently begun to improve the information available to the public on grant-aided properties that \nthey have a right to visit. In June 1999 it published a comprehensive list of such properties including details of a \ncontact point(26) which is now available on Cadw's Internet site(27). In our view this is a very commendable \ninitiative on Cadw's part to facilitate public access to these properties. Cadw accepts the recommendations made by \nthe Auditor General for Wales for improvements in this area. Cadw will test directly whether owners are complying \nwith the requirement to advertise and to allow public access to their properties. It will also introduce a more \nsystematic procedure for registering any complaints received from members of the public about access and \nrecording the action taken(28). \nFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CHIRK CASTLE \n18. Under a legally binding agreement reached in 1981 Cadw is obliged to fund, in perpetuity, the annual \nmaintenance deficit incurred by the National Trust in running Chirk Castle. In addition Cadw has also offered \nfurther building grants for capital works at the Castle(29). Cadw considers that the agreement is the only one that \ncould have been signed at the time, after Chirk Castle had been bought for the nation and a condition of the \npurchase, imposed by the Treasury, was that it should be transferred to the National Trust. The arrangement reached \ndid prejudice future options for negotiations and Cadw can not foresee circumstances in which it would recommend \na similar agreement to the Assembly now(30). \n19. The annual maintenance deficit, currently capped at £250,000 a year, is calculated by setting identified elements \nof income against identified elements of expenditure. Cadw agreed that the National Trust could retain member \nvisitor credits, of about £60,000 a year, so that it could build up a reserve at the Castle to pay for future capital works. However, the assumption always was that the Castle would also be eligible for building grants for capital \nworks(31). The National Trust informed us that its reserve fund at the Castle, which had been valued at some \n£1,224,000 (32), is some considerable way short of providing adequate funding to support future capital works and \nhas been reduced to under £1 million by funding the balance for various capital works at the Castle(33). \n20. Cadw acknowledges that the arrangement has affected the grant support available to other historic properties in \nWales and considers that one way forward, when discussing funding arrangements for the next and future years, \nwould be to link its support for Chirk Castle to a maximum covering all National Trust properties in Wales(34). \nFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS \n21. Our main findings and conclusions are as follows. \nOn protecting the built heritage \n(i) Although Cadw is on target to update the statutory lists of historic buildings by completing the resurvey of Wales \nin 2005, the statutory lists remain inadequate by modern standards. Cadw needs to work hard to maintain the \nmomentum of its current work if target dates are to be met. Until this work is completed, many buildings will not \nenjoy the statutory protection that they deserve. \n(ii) Some buildings that should have been identified for listing during resurveys had been overlooked. Cadw has \nissued further guidance to its contractors to draw this issue to their attention. Cadw will also undertake checks \nrecommended by the Auditor General for Wales to identify any further cases of buildings being missed by \ncontractors. We endorse the steps by Cadw to tighten up its supervision of contractors undertaking resurveys. \n(iii) It is a matter of concern that local planning authorities in Wales lack sufficient heritage expertise to handle \nstraightforward listed building consent applications without reference to Cadw. It must make sense to use the \nknowledge of the local area that planning authorities possess in the listed building consent process wherever \npossible. We therefore endorse Cadw's efforts to increase heritage expertise in Wales and increasingly to delegate \nmore listed building consent work where possible. \n(iv) At the current rate of progress it will take over 20 years to provide statutory protection through scheduling to all \nthe monuments of national importance in Wales, although Cadw aim to schedule most known monuments in five to \nseven years. This position is a matter of concern which Cadw will need to consider in the light of the resources \navailable to it. \n(v) A more rigorous and transparent grant application assessment process is required to direct resources to areas of \ngreatest need. Cadw proposes to restructure the current scheme by setting up a number of sub-schemes covering \ndifferent categories of buildings and recipients, including buildings at risk, and to assess and score grant \napplications against separate criteria for each scheme. We welcome this important development. \n(vi) A key element in this process is the establishment of a buildings at risk register for Wales. There may be \nbetween 200 and 250 buildings at risk from serious neglect, but work on compiling a buildings at risk register is not \nadvanced as not enough local authorities have taken up Cadw's offer to fund 50 per cent of the cost of this work. We \nnote that a buildings at risk register already exists in England and we are disappointed at the lack of progress being \nmade in Wales. On grant conditions \n(vii) Cadw had not maximised the benefit from grant conditions as these applied for 10 years from the date on \nwhich the grant offer was accepted rather than the date of payment, which is often much later. Cadw has accepted \nand implemented the Auditor General for Wales' recommendation to apply grant conditions from the date of \npayment. We welcome this action which will improve the public benefit from grants. \n(viii) Cadw has not established effective monitoring procedures to establish whether all recipients are complying \nwith grant conditions and to recover grants when these become repayable. Cadw has now addressed the weaknesses \nin its monitoring system, which arose from staff shortages, and proposes to extend this system to all cases when the \nnecessary computer system, planned for implementation in 2001, is in place. \n(ix) Cadw could not justify the delay in taking effective action on the case identified by the Auditor General for \nWales where a grant recipient had sold his property without informing Cadw. We note that legal action is now \nunderway to recover the £58,500 due under the clawback clause. We endorse the recommendations made by the \nAuditor General for Wales for improvements in internal control, including checking ownership at the Land Registry \nwhen attempts to contact owners are unsuccessful, and Cadw's agreement to implement the necessary changes \nstraightaway. But we note Cadw's admission that the problems encountered in this clawback case would have been \nprevented if recovery of grant had been made the subject of a legal charge or a local land charge. In addition, we \nnote that there may be other options open to Cadw for strengthening the legal protection of its interest in these \nproperties. \n(x) It is difficult for members of the public to identify those grant-aided properties to which they have a right of \naccess. Cadw has only recently begun to improve the information available to the public on grant-aided properties \nthey have a right to visit. We endorse the recommendations made by the Auditor General for Wales for \nimprovements and Cadw's agreement to implement the necessary changes; and we welcome Cadw's initiative to use \nits Internet site to publicise those properties which the public have a right to visit. \nOn financial support for Chirk Castle \n(xi) The maintenance deficit agreement contains no limit to the level of funding Cadw is required to provide in \nperpetuity to the National Trust for Chirk Castle. Cadw said that it would not be prepared to enter such an \nagreement now, but it was the only one that could have been signed at the time. We note that the agreement has \naffected the grant support available to other historic properties in Wales. We consider that such an arrangement, \nwhich contains no provisions for review, is incongruous with modern public administration. \n(xii) Although the National Trust have accumulated a revenue reserve at Chirk Castle valued at some £1,224,000 \nand continue to enjoy annual maintenance funding, Cadw has also offered additional building grants for capital \nworks at the Castle. Given the state of the National Trust's financial resources at Chirk Castle, we are not convinced \nthat such additional grant support from the National Assembly can be justified. \nRECOMMENDATIONS \n22. In the light of these findings and conclusions, we make the following recommendations: \n(i) The aim to schedule most known monuments in five to seven years should become a specific target for Cadw against which its progress should be reported annually. \n(ii) Compiling a buildings at risk register for Wales should be given a high priority. \n(iii) Cadw should as quickly as possible secure its right to clawback grant on any disposal of property on which a \nmaintenance grant has been paid. In doing this Cadw should explore as a matter of urgency the options open to it for \nsecuring stronger legal protection of its interests in these properties. \n(iv) Cadw should seek to negotiate more appropriate arrangements with the National Trust for helping to fund Chirk \nCastle. We believe that these should include, for example, member credits being logged against the maintenance \ndeficit. \n(v) In the future, any grant applications for Chirk Castle should be subject to a detailed financial appraisal to \ndetermine whether the level of resources available to the National Trust at the property, including the accumulated \nrevenue reserve, warrant additional financial support of this nature. \n(vi) Cadw should link funding for Chirk Castle with the funds allocated to grants to other National Trust properties \nin Wales to avoid adverse impacts on other owners of historic properties. \nCONCLUDING COMMENTS \n23. As Wales enters a new millennium and prepares to meet the challenges of the future, it is vital that we do not \nlose sight of our history and traditions. Cadw plays a key role in protecting and conserving the built heritage of \nWales and the purpose of this report has been to help Cadw fulfil its responsibilities more efficiently and \neffectively. In this context, the Committee was pleased to note Cadw's view that, in the medium term, the \nimplementation of conclusions and recommendations identified by the Auditor General for Wales would involve \nminimal costs and achieve a significant net increase in value for money(35). For example, better monitoring of \ngrants could save £5,000 a year under the claw-back condition with the prospect of much larger savings from time \nto time, and improving public access could realise benefits valued at up to £80,000 a year. We will watch with \ninterest Cadw's progress in implementing the Auditor General's recommendations and its response to the \nCommittee's report. \nFootnotes \n(1)  Report by the AGW presented to the National Assembly on 29 October 1999 \n(2)  Letter from the National Trust dated 8 December 1999 \n(3)  Letter from Mr Cassidy dated 8 December 1999 \n(4)  AGW's report: para 1.1 \n(5)  AGW's report: Figure 2 \n(6)  AGW report: para 2.20 \n(7)  AGW report: para 2.5 \n(8)  Q17 \n(9)  Q19 \n(10) AGW report: paras 2.13 and 2.14 \n(11) AGWreport: para 2.15 \n(12) Qs 21 and 22 \n(13) AGW report: paras 2.16-2.18 (14) Qs 2-4 \n(15) AGW's report: paras 3.2 and 3.6-3.8 \n(16) Qs 40-42 \n(17) Q28-29 \n(18) Qs 6 and 35 \n(19) AGW's report: para 3.8 \n(20) AGW's report: paras 3.24 and 3.25 \n(21) Q67 \n(22) AGW's report: paras 3.29 and 3.30 \n(23) Qs 66 \n(24) AGW's report: paras 3.32 and 3.33 \n(25) Qs 74-79 \n(26) AGW's report: paras 3.38, 3.39 \n(27) Q40 \n(28) Qs 79-91 \n(29) AGW's report: paras 3.43 and 3.45 \n(30) Q45 \n(31) Qs 52 and 54 \n(32) AGW's report: para 3.14 \n(33) Letter from the National Trust: para 5 \n(34) Qs 48 and 61 \n(35) Letter from Mr Cassidy dated 8 December 1999 \n(Back to Contents) \n  \nANNEX A \n \n  \n  \nCynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru Pwyllgor Archwilio \nThe National Assembly for Wales \nAudit Committee \nDydd Iau 18 Tachwedd 1999 \nThursday 18 November 1999 \n  \nPresennol: Janet Davies (Cadeirydd), Peter Black, Alun Cairns, Christine Chapman, Geraint \nDavies, Brian Gibbons, Alison Halford, Alun Pugh a’r swyddogion canlynol: Syr John Bourn, \nArchwilydd Cyffredinol Cymru, Phil Gray, Swyddog Cydymffurfio y Cynulliad, Frank Grogan, \nSwyddfa Archwilio Genedlaethol Cymru a Jon Shortridge, Ysgrifennydd Parhaol. \nPresent: Janet Davies (Chair), Peter Black, Alun Cairns, Christine Chapman, Geraint Davies, \nBrian Gibbons, Alison Halford, Alun Pugh and the following officials: Sir John Bourn, Auditor \nGeneral for Wales, Phil Gray, Assembly Compliance Officer, Frank Grogan, National Audit \nOffice Wales and Jon Shortridge, Permanent Secretary. \nDechreuodd y sesiwn cymryd tystiolaeth am 9.32 a.m. gyda Janet Davies yn cadeirio.

If we yn cynghori Cadw a’r Cynulliad ar faterion o’r \ncall risk real dereliction and, probably, an fath, i awdurdodau lleol yn ddiweddar yn unoccupied building, there may be around 200- gofyn iddynt nodi adeiladau mewn perygl yn \n250 such buildings throughout Wales. That is eu hardaloedd hwy. Nid ydym wedi cael yr \nvery much an estimate. That is what my holl ymatebion eto. Mae’n dibynnu sut yr \narchitect colleagues think the figure is likely to ydych yn diffinio ‘mewn perygl’. Os ydym yn \nbe. galw cyflwr adfeiliedig gwirioneddol ac \nadeilad gwag, yn ôl pob tebyg, yn risg, efallai \nbod tua 200-250 o adeiladau o’r fath ledled \nCymru. Amcangyfrif bras iawn yw hynny. Hyn \nyw’r ffigur tebygol ym marn fy \nnghydweithwyr sydd yn benseiri. \nBrian Gibbons: In general, would you say that Brian Gibbons: Yn gyffredinol, a fyddech yn \nproperty owners welcomed their buildings dweud bod perchenogion yr eiddo yn \nbeing listed, and in what circumstances would croesawu’r ffaith bod eu hadeiladau’n cael eu \nthey not welcome buildings being listed? rhestru, ac ym mha amgylchiadau na fyddent \nyn croesawu adeiladau yn cael eu rhestru? \nMr Cassidy: Some do and some do not. It is Mr Cassidy: Mae rhai yn croesawu hynny ac \nvery interesting that in the four years that I eraill ddim. Diddorol yw nodi y gallaf feddwl \nhave been in Cadw, I can think of many am lawer o gwynion yr ydym wedi eu derbyn \ncomplaints that we have received about not ynglyn â pheidio â rhestru adeiladau yn ystod y \nlisting buildings. I am a secondee from the pedair blynedd y bûm gyda Cadw. Yr wyf ar \nDepartment of Trade and Industry and I had secondiad o’r Adran Diwydiant a Masnach ac \nthought it would have been the other way yr oeddwn wedi meddwl y byddai’r \naround. Most of the complaints and pressure gwrthwyneb yn wir. Mae mwyafrif y cwynion \non Cadw is always to list more. It varies. a’r pwysau sydd ar Cadw yn ymwneud â \nListing can enhance a property value and it can rhestru mwy bob amser. Mae’n amrywio.

It is an advantage in that sense and a newid yr adeilad neu os byddwch yn gwneud \nlot of people, of course, who take pride in their gwaith adeiladu arno. Mae’n fantais yn yr ystyr \nbuildings will welcome listing. Those who honno a bydd llawer o bobl, wrth gwrs, sydd \nwant to alter buildings or demolish them may yn ymfalchïo yn eu hadeiladau, yn croesawu \nnot, although the listed building consent rhestru. Ond efallai y bydd y bobl sydd am \nprocess is there for them to go through. Listing newid neu ddymchwel adeiladau yn teimlo’n \nis not a preservation order. All it really means wahanol, er bod y broses caniatâd ynghylch \nis that the value of a building is flagged up so adeilad rhestredig yno iddynt ei dilyn. Nid yw \nthat it can be taken into account by a local rhestru yn orchymyn cadwraeth. Y cyfan y authority when looking at questions of mae’n ei olygu mewn gwirionedd yw bod \nplanning permission. gwerth adeilad yn cael ei nodi fel y gall \nawdurdod lleol ei ystyried wrth edrych ar \ngwestiynau yn ymwneud â chaniatâd \ncynllunio. \nBrian Gibbons: It would be fair to say as a Brian Gibbons: Byddai’n deg dweud felly, \ngeneralisation, therefore, that owners welcome gan gyffredinoli, fod perchenogion o’r farn mai \ntheir buildings being listed. Is that the attitude da o beth yw rhestru eu hadeiladau. Ai dyna’r \nin your experience? agwedd yn eich profiad chi? \nMr Cassidy: We get very few complaints from Mr Cassidy: Prin iawn yw’r cwynion a gawn \npeople whose buildings are listed. We get gan bobl y mae eu hadeiladau wedi eu rhestru. \nsome complaints and they can be quite Fe gawn rai cwynion a gallant fod yn eithaf \nvociferous. I find it rather difficult, though, to croch. Ond yr wyf yn ei chael yn anodd, fodd \ngive you a general sense of what most people bynnag, rhoi ymdeimlad cyffredinol ichi o farn \nwith listed buildings feel about listing. What I y rhan fwyaf o bobl sydd ag adeiladau \ncan say is that the influences upon Cadw, for rhestredig ynglyn â rhestru. Yr hyn y gallaf ei \nexample the Welsh Affairs Select Committee ddweud yw bod y dylanwadau ar Cadw, er \nand heritage organisations, are keen that the enghraifft y Pwyllgor Dethol Materion \nlisting survey should be progressed rapidly Cymreig a sefydliadau treftadaeth, yn awyddus \nbecause they see value in it. i arolwg rhestru fynd rhagddo’n gyflym gan eu \nbod yn gweld gwerth ynddo. \nBrian Gibbons: For those people who are not Brian Gibbons: O ran y bobl hynny nad ydynt \nhappy about having their buildings listed, do yn hapus ynghylch eu hadeiladau’n cael eu \nyou think that the lack of an effective appeals rhestru, a ydych chi o’r farn fod diffyg \nmechanism reduces the owner’s commitment mecanwaith apelio effeithiol yn lleihau \nto having the building listed? ymrwymiad y perchennog i restru’r adeilad? \nMr Cassidy: There is no formal appeals Mr Cassidy: Nid oes unrhyw fecanwaith \nmechanism at the time of listing. However, apelio ffurfiol ar adeg rhestru. Fodd bynnag, \nlocal authorities have a duty to inform mae dyletswydd ar awdurdodau lleol i hysbysu \nhouseholders that their building has been deiliaid tai fod eu hadeilad wedi ei restru. Fel \nlisted. As an additional service, Cadw always gwasanaeth ychwanegol, mae Cadw yn anfon \nsends out an early notification. There is no hysbysiad cynnar bob amser. Nid oes unrhyw \nstatutory requirement to do that, but we do and ofyniad statudol i wneud hynny, ond fe wnawn \nthat alerts people to the fact that they can, if hyn ac mae’n hysbysu pobl o’r ffaith y gallant, \nthey wish, contact us if they have objections to os dymunant, gysylltu â ni os oes ganddynt \nwhat has taken place. Secondly, when listed unrhyw wrthwynebiad i’r hyn sydd wedi \nbuilding consent is sought and refused by a digwydd. Yn ail, pan geisir caniatâd adeilad \nlocal authority, one of the arguments that the rhestredig a’i wrthod gan awdurdod lleol, un \nhouseholder can put to the Assembly in o’r dadleuon y gall deiliad y ty ei rhoi gerbron \nobjecting to that decision is that the building y Cynulliad wrth wrthwynebu’r penderfyniad \nshould not have been listed in the first place. hwnnw yw na ddylai’r adeilad fod wedi ei \nThat is, effectively, a form of appeal against restru yn y lle cyntaf. Mae hynny, at ei gilydd, \nlisting. yn ffordd o apelio yn erbyn rhestru. Brian Gibbons: Is there any mechanism by Brian Gibbons: A oes unrhyw beirianwaith \nwhich compensation is available to owners sydd yn sicrhau bod iawndal ar gael i \nwho feel that the economic potential of their berchenogion sydd yn teimlo bod potensial \nbuildings is reduced by listing? If such a economaidd eu hadeiladau wedi gostwng o \nmechanism is not available, does that hinder ganlyniad i’r rhestru? Os nad oes peirianwaith \nCadw’s work? o’r fath ar gael, a yw hynny’n llesteirio gwaith \nCadw? \nMr Cassidy: There is no mechanism that I am Mr Cassidy: Nid oes unrhyw beirianwaith ar \naware of, apart from the provisions for VAT gael yr wyf yn ymwybodol ohono, ac eithrio’r \nexemption on certain building works.

O ganlyniad, byddai yna gymhelliad \nincentive not to do anything to preserve the economaidd i beidio â gwneud unrhyw beth i \nbuilding. The owner would therefore just sit warchod yr adeilad.

Brian Gibbons: But if owners still decide to Brian Gibbons: Ond os bydd perchenogion yn \ndo nothing, because either they cannot afford penderfynu peidio â gwneud unrhyw beth o \nto do so or it does not make economic sense to hyd, am na allant fforddio gwneud hynny neu \nthem, what happens? am nad yw’n gwneud synnwyr economaidd \niddynt, beth fydd yn digwydd? \nMr Cassidy: That could happen and does Mr Cassidy: Gallai hynny ddigwydd ac mae \nhappen. That is one of the reasons why we are yn digwydd. Dyna un o’r rhesymau pam ein \ntrying to develop our database on buildings at bod yn ceisio datblygu ein cronfa ddata ar \nrisk. If the buildings are of sufficient worth, if adeiladau sydd mewn perygl. Os oes gwerth \nthey are outstanding buildings, then Cadw will digonol i’r adeiladau, os ydynt yn adeiladau \nbe in a position to try to take some action. As I eithriadol, yna bydd Cadw mewn sefyllfa i \nsaid, our work on buildings at risk is not well geisio cymryd rhai camau. Fel y dywedais, nid \nadvanced yet. We thought that the priority was yw ein gwaith ar adeiladau sydd mewn perygl \nto persevere with the listing resurvey so that wedi datblygu’n bell eto. Yr oeddem o’r farn \nwe could first of all identify which buildings mai’r flaenoriaeth oedd dyfalbarhau gyda’r \nwere valuable before we looked at which of ailarolwg rhestru er mwyn inni allu, yn gyntaf, \nthem were at risk.

Ni \nwas not really fully recognised until English sylweddolwyd pwysigrwydd yr adeilad yn \nHeritage did a full thematic study of churches llwyr nes i English Heritage gynnal astudiaeth \nand buildings of that period. It was as a result of thematig lawn o eglwysi ac adeiladau o’r \nthe research that they did that we became aware cyfnod hwnnw. Daethom yn ymwybodol bod \nthat the building was more important than had yr adeilad yn bwysicach nag a aseswyd yn \nbeen originally assessed. I do not think it was a wreiddiol o ganlyniad i’r ymchwil a \ncase of the contractor being neglectful so much wnaethpwyd ganddynt. Nid wyf yn credu mai \nas our state of awareness of the importance of achos o esgeulustod ar ran y contractwr oedd \nthat type of building being the issue. hyn, yn hytrach ein hymwybyddiaeth o \nbwysigrwydd y math hwnnw o adeilad yw’r \nmater dan sylw. \nAlison Halford: So where does the fault lie?

Mr Avent: It is a mixture. If you are surveying Mr Avent: Mae’n gymysgedd. Os ydych yn \nan urban area, you are looking at an awful lot of arolygu ardal drefol, yr ydych yn edrych ar \nbuildings, therefore it is more time intensive, nifer fawr o adeiladau, felly mae’n cymryd \nusually.

Janet Davies: We will move on to the part of Janet Davies: Symudwn ymlaen at y rhan o’r \nthe report that deals with targeting grants for adroddiad sydd yn ymdrin â thargedu grantiau \nheritage buildings in Wales. I would like to start ar gyfer adeiladau treftadaeth yng Nghymru. \nby referring to paragraphs 3.6 and 3.8. It seems Hoffwn ddechrau drwy gyfeirio at baragraffau \nclear that grant expenditure has not been 3.6. a 3.8. Mae’n amlwg nad yw gwariant \ntargeted at particular categories of buildings or grant wedi ei dargedu at gategorïau penodol o \nrecipients and that applications have not been adeiladau neu dderbynyddion ac nad yw’r \nranked in order of merit. In the absence of such ceisiadau wedi eu gosod yn nhrefn \nprocedures, how do you ensure that grant teilyngdod. Yn absenoldeb gweithdrefnau o’r \nsupport is directed towards historic buildings at fath, sut yr ydych chi’n sicrhau y caiff \nthe greatest risk of being lost? cymorth grant ei gyfeirio at adeiladau \nhanesyddol sydd dan fwyaf o berygl o gael eu \ncolli? \nMr Cassidy: As I mentioned earlier, we are Mr Cassidy: Fel y crybwyllais yn gynharach, \nvery alert to buildings at risk that come to our yr ydym yn ymwybodol iawn o adeiladau \nattention.

Felly yr wyf yn credu ein bod \ntargeted are other categories of buildings, apart wedi targedu adeiladau mewn perygl yn \nfrom cathedrals, and it is one of the things gyffredinol mewn ffordd.

Mr Cassidy: It is a combination of both. In Mr Cassidy: Cyfuniad o’r ddau ydyw. Er \norder to qualify for a historic buildings grant at mwyn bod yn gymwys ar gyfer grant \nall, buildings have to be judged outstanding by adeiladau hanesyddol o gwbl, mae’n rhaid i \nthe Historic Buildings Council for Wales.

I refer to paragraphs roddwyd i’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol i’w \n3.9 to 3.11, which set out the background to redeg. Cyfeiriaf at baragraffau 3.9 a 3.11, sydd \nthe agreement, that is, ‘to fund in perpetuity yn gosod y cefndir i’r cytundeb, sef, ‘ariannu’r \nthe annual maintenance deficit incurred by the diffyg cynhaliaeth flynyddol a achoswyd gan \nNational Trust’ at Chirk Castle.

Mr Cassidy, sut yr ydych \nparticularly in terms of good value for money yn cyfiawnhau’r trefniant hwn, yn arbennig yn \nfor the taxpayer? nhermau gwerth da am arian i’r trethdalwr? \nMr Cassidy: The question really is whether at Mr Cassidy: Y cwestiwn mewn gwirionedd \npresent the Government would enter into any yw a fyddai’r Llywodraeth ar hyn o bryd yn \nsuch agreement. I think that this agreement is ymrwymo i gytundeb o’r fath. Yr wyf yn credu \nthe only one that could have been signed at the mai’r cytundeb hwn yw’r unig un y gellid bod \ntime, after Chirk Castle had been bought for wedi ei lofnodi ar y pryd, ar ôl i Gastell y \nthe nation and a condition of the purchase, Waun gael ei brynu i’r genedl ac un o’r \nimposed by the Treasury, was that it should be amodau prynu, a osodwyd gan y Trysorlys, \ntransferred to the National Trust.

Fel rhan o hynny, un o’r cynigion y bydd \nto think about changing the terms of the angen inni ei ystyried yw a fyddwn yn \nagreement. However, that has to be done by gwahodd yr Ymddiriedolaeth i feddwl am \nnegotiation because the agreement is legally newid termau’r cytundeb. Fodd bynnag, mae’n \nbinding. Would you like me to explain briefly rhaid i hynny gael ei wneud drwy gyd-drafod \nthe main features of the agreement? oherwydd bod y cytundeb yn gyfreithiol \nrwymol. A hoffech imi egluro’n fyr brif \nnodweddion y cytundeb? \nJanet Davies: Yes. I think it would be a good Janet Davies: Hoffwn. Credaf y byddai \nidea. hynny’n syniad da. \nMr Cassidy: I will refer to these notes because Mr Cassidy: Byddaf yn cyfeirio at y nodiadau \nit is quite complex. When the Government hyn gan ei bod yn eithaf cymhleth. Pan \nacquired Chirk Castle and handed it over to the gaffaelodd y Llywodraeth Gastell y Waun a’i \nNational Trust in 1981, two agreements were drosglwyddo i’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol \nsigned, in effect. One was to fund a capital yn 1981, llofnodwyd dau gytundeb, mewn \nworks programme for 15 years at 100 per cent gwirionedd. Yr oedd un yn ymwneud ag \nand £2.9 million was spent on that. The other ariannu rhaglen gwaith cyfalaf am 15 mlynedd \nwas to fund an ongoing operational ar 100 y cant a gwariwyd £2.9 miliwn ar \nmaintenance deficit because there was no hynny. Yr oedd y llall yn ymwneud ag ariannu \nexpectation that maintaining and presenting the diffyg cynhaliaeth weithredol parhaus gan nad \nproperty would cover its own costs, which I oedd unrhyw ddisgwyl y byddai cynnal a \nthink is reasonable. No National Trust property chadw a chyflwyno’r eiddo yn talu am ei \nof which I am aware does so and I know that gostau ei hun, sy’n rhesymol yn fy marn i. Nid \nmonuments do not. The cost of presenting oes unrhyw eiddo sydd yn perthyn i’r \nthem to the public is large. Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol yr wyf yn \nymwybodol ohono yn gwneud hynny ac fe wn \nnad yw henebion yn gwneud hynny. Mae’r \ngost o’u cyflwyno i’r cyhoedd yn fawr. \nThat is calculated by setting identified Cyfrifir hynny drwy osod elfennau penodol o \nelements of income against identified elements incwm yn erbyn elfennau penodol o wariant. O \nof expenditure. On the income side, there are ran incwm, ceir ffioedd mynediad, rhenti, \nadmission fees, rents, produce from the land cynnyrch o’r tir a mathau eraill o \nand other sorts of receipts. On the expenditure dderbynebion. O ran gwariant, ceir cyflogau, \nside, there are wages, routine repairs, costs of atgyweiriadau arferol, costau gwasanaethau a \nservices and facilities, advertising and chyfleusterau, hysbysebu a \npublicity—everything that is predictable—but chyhoeddusrwydd—popeth y gellir ei \nalso a management fee of 20 per cent, which ragweld—ond hefyd ffi reoli o 20 y cant y \nthe National Trust includes on the expenditure mae’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol yn ei \nside and which goes to fund the National Trust chynnwys yn y gwariant ac sydd yn mynd tuag \ncentrally. That is a levy that it makes on all its at ariannu’r Ymddiriedolaeth yn ganolog. Mae \nproperties. I think that on a lot of properties it hyn yn ardoll y mae’n ei chodi ar bob eiddo is 27 per cent. At Chirk Castle, it is 20 per sydd ganddi. Yr wyf yn credu mai 27 y cant \ncent. yw hyn ar lawer o’r eiddo. Yng Nghastell y \nWaun, 20 y cant ydyw. \nThe Government undertook to fund the Yn ei hanfod, ymgymerodd y Llywodraeth ag \ndifference, essentially. To change that ariannu’r gwahaniaeth. Byddai newid y \nagreement in any way would require the cytundeb hwnnw mewn unrhyw ffordd yn \nagreement of the National Trust. It is one of gofyn am gytundeb yr Ymddiriedolaeth \nthe things that we need to think about when we Genedlaethol. Y mae’n un o’r pethau y mae \ntalk to the Trust about future funding. angen inni feddwl amdano pan fyddwn yn sôn \nam ariannu’r Ymddiriedolaeth yn y dyfodol. \nJanet Davies: What you are actually saying is Janet Davies: Yr hyn yr ydych yn ei ddweud \nthat the Assembly—the public taxpayer—is mewn gwirionedd yw bod y Cynulliad—y \nactually giving a contribution to the National trethdalwyr—yn rhoi cyfraniad i’r \nTrust itself through Chirk Castle? Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol ei hun drwy \nGastell y Waun? \nMr Cassidy: Yes—to the National Trust Mr Cassidy: Ie—i’r Ymddiriedolaeth \ncentrally, as all National Trust properties do. Genedlaethol yn ganolog, fel y gwna pob eiddo \nThis was part of the agreement that was signed i’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol. Yr oedd \nback in 1981. I believe that reflects the sort of hyn yn rhan o’r cytundeb a lofnodwyd yn ôl yn \nservices which the National Trust make 1981.

Genedlaethol yn eu darparu’n ganolog i Gastell \ny Waun, er enghraifft, drwy hysbysebu’n \ngenedlaethol a chyfleusterau cymorth. \nJanet Davies: The funding ceiling of £250,000 Janet Davies: Daw terfyn yr arian o £250,000 \nexpires at the end of March, presumably. Is it i ben ddiwedd fis Mawrth, gellid tybio. A yw’n \npossible for you to give any indication of what bosibl ichi roi unrhyw awgrym o’r hyn a allai \nthat might be replaced by? ddod yn ei le? \nMr Cassidy: It is rather difficult because Mr Cassidy: Mae’n eithaf anodd oherwydd er \nalthough the National Trust has indicated that i’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol nodi y \nit would like additional money for next year, it byddai’n hoffi cael arian ychwanegol y \nhas not actually given us any firm proposals flwyddyn nesaf, nid yw wedi rhoi unrhyw \nyet. Earlier, we discussed with the Trust gynnig pendant inni hyd yma. Yn gynharach, \nfunding arrangements for this year but decided trafodasom y trefniadau ariannu ar gyfer eleni \nthat we would simply roll forward the gyda’r Ymddiriedolaeth ond penderfynwyd y \n£250,000 so that the Assembly could take a byddem yn cario’r £250,000 yn ei flaen fel y \nview on all this. We have not actually gallai’r Cynulliad lunio barn ynghylch hyn oll. \ndiscussed with the Trust in detail what it thinks Nid ydym wedi trafod yn fanwl gyda’r \nit needs for next year. The National Trust may Ymddiriedolaeth yr hyn y cred y bydd ei angen \nhave proposals which would cost money, and ar gyfer y flwyddyn nesaf. Efallai y bydd gan \nif money were available, they might be yr Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol gynigion a \ndesirable things to do. However, I am fyddai’n costio arian, a phe bai arian ar gael, \nconfident that the Assembly would not be efallai y byddai’n ddymunol gwneud y pethau \nreneging on its legal commitment if the current hynny. Fodd bynnag, yr wyf yn hyderus na package were rolled forward again. I think fyddai’r Cynulliad yn torri ei ymrwymiad \neverybody will need to take into account the cyfreithiol pe bai’r pecyn cyfredol yn cael ei \nfact that Cadw’s own budget has been at a gario ymlaen eto. Yr wyf yn credu y bydd yn \nstandstill for the past four or five years. rhaid i bawb ystyried y ffaith bod cyllideb \nCadw ei hun wedi aros yn ei hunfan yn ystod y \npedair neu bum mlynedd diwethaf. \nAlun Cairns: Why, when you were funding Alun Cairns: Pam felly, pan oeddech yn \ncapital works costing £3 million, did the cost ariannu gwaith cyfalaf yn costio £3 miliwn, y \nof the maintenance deficit escalate so rapidly gwnaeth cost y diffyg cynhaliaeth gynyddu \nfrom £49,000 in 1981-82 to £280,000 in 1994- mor gyflym o £49,000 yn 1981-82 i £280,000 \n95—a three-fold increase in real terms? yn 1994-95—cynnydd triphlyg mewn termau \ngwirioneddol? \nMr Cassidy: That rise occurred Mr Cassidy: Digwyddodd y cynnydd hwnnw \nbecause—although I would not say that the oherwydd—er na ddywedwn fod y castell yn \ncastle was starting from a standing start as dechrau o’r dechrau gan fod rhywfaint o staff \nthere was a skeleton National Trust staff there yr Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol yno o’r \nfrom the very moment it was transferred to the foment y cafodd ei drosglwyddo i’r \nNational Trust—it was being geared up in Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol—ei fod yn cael \norder to receive visitors and what that meant ei baratoi er mwyn derbyn ymwelwyr ac yr \nwas an increase in the number of staff. In the oedd hynny’n golygu cynnydd yn nifer y staff. \nmid-80s, I think there were eight members of Yng nghanol yr 80au, credaf fod yno wyth \nstaff. It rose to 13 including, for example, staff aelod o staff. Cynyddodd i 13 yn cynnwys, er \nsuch as an Education Officer who was enghraifft, staff megis Swyddog Addysg a \nemployed as soon as Chirk Castle reached the gyflogwyd cyn gynted ag y cyrhaeddodd \nstandard where it could be presented properly Castell y Waun y safon lle gellid ei gyflwyno’n \nand schools could be welcomed to it.

So the cost of hefyd systemau diogelwch; systemau larwm a \ngearing Chirk Castle up to receive the public systemau tân. Felly cost paratoi Castell y \nwas the factor which pushed the deficit up past Waun ar gyfer derbyn y cyhoedd oedd y \ninflation. Wages are the key to that, I think, ffactor a oedd yn gwthio’r diffyg yn uwch na \nbecause they rose just over six-fold—not chwyddiant. Cyflogau yw’r allwedd i hynny, fe \nbecause the National Trust was paying itself gredaf, gan iddynt godi ychydig yn fwy na \nmore, but because they were taking on chwephlyg—nid oherwydd bod yr \nadditional staff to deal with an additional Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol yn talu mwy \nnumber of visitors. iddo’i hun, ond oherwydd eu bod yn cyflogi \nstaff ychwanegol i ddelio â’r nifer ychwanegol \no ymwelwyr. \nAlun Cairns: I am sure that everyone would Alun Cairns: Yr wyf yn siwr y byddai pawb \nwelcome the fact that the castle was being yn croesawu’r ffaith bod y castell ar gael i’r \nmade available to the public.

In Lloegr, gan fod chwech o’r rheini.

As I mentioned earlier, compared to mewn gwirionedd. Fel y soniais yn gynharach, \nthe properties in England it is pretty much o’i gymharu â’r eiddo yn Lloegr mae fwy neu \nequivalent. In England, there is currently a lai yn cyfateb. Yn Lloegr, ar hyn o bryd ceir \nmaintenance deficit of £970,000, but that is diffyg cynhaliaeth o £970,000 ond mae \nindex-linked, so it will rise. In England the hwnnw’n fynegrifedig, felly bydd yn codi. Yn \nGovernment does not pay all of the Lloegr nid yw’r Llywodraeth yn talu’r cyfan \nmaintenance deficit because the situation is o’r diffyg cynhaliaeth gan fod y sefyllfa’n \ndifferent in respect of the fact that there is no wahanol o ran y ffaith nad oes unrhyw \nlegally binding commitment. Effectively, these ymrwymiad sydd yn gyfreithiol rwymol. I bob \nproperties were taken over by the National pwrpas, aeth yr eiddo hyn i ddwylo’r \nTrust on the basis of gentleman’s agreements Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol ar sail \ngoing back to the 1960s and 1970s. cytundebau gwyr sydd yn dyddio o’r 1960au \na’r 1970au. The real deficit of these properties is about Felly mae diffyg gwirioneddol yr eiddo hyn \n£1.3 million. Member visitor credits are tua £1.3 miliwn. Cynhwysir credydau’r \nincluded in that. If you take those out, the ymwelwyr sydd yn aelodau yn y ffigur \nfigure is more than six times the deficit of hwnnw. Pe baech yn tynnu’r rheini, mae’r \nChirk Castle. On that basis I do not think that ffigur yn fwy na chwe gwaith diffyg Castell y \n£250,000 is an unreasonable sum for the Waun. Ar y sail honno nid wyf yn credu bod \noperation of Chirk Castle. £250,000 yn swm afresymol ar gyfer \ngweithredu Castell y Waun. \nAlun Cairns: Can you extend your answer to Alun Cairns: A allech ymhelaethau ar eich \ninclude the capital grants? ateb i gynnwys y grantiau cyfalaf? \nMr Cassidy: As I mentioned, English Mr Cassidy: Fel y crybwyllais, mae English \nHeritage includes member visitor credits in Heritage yn cynnwys credydau’r ymwelwyr \nthis calculation. As a result of that, it will pay sydd yn aelodau yn y cyfrifiad hwn. O \n100 per cent capital grants. We have let the ganlyniad i hynny, bydd yn talu grantiau \nNational Trust build up its assets.

Fodd bynnag, fel y gwelwch o gost \nbe very, very expensive indeed. I, personally, dim ond atgyweirio’r clwydi, gall \ndo not think that the assets that the National atgyweiriadau hanesyddol ar gyfer y math hwn \nTrust currently has for Chirk Castle would be o brosiect fod yn hynod gostus. Yn bersonol, \nsufficient to meet future capital works. They nid wyf yn credu y byddai’r asedau sydd gan \nwould dissipate quite quickly.

Byddent yn \nleave the Trust the member visitor credits and diflannu’n eithaf cyflym. Felly fy marn \nmake a contribution under classic historic bersonol yw mai’r cytundeb a luniwyd \nbuildings grant to future capital works, is rhyngom a’r Ymddiriedolaeth Genedlaethol \nprobably the right way to go.

This refers to paragraphs 3.24 to grant Cadw. Mae hyn yn cyfeirio at \n3.34. Paragraph 3.29 records a number of baragraffau 3.24 a 3.34.

Janet Davies: Iawn. \nMr Cassidy: Cadw can be vulnerable in that Mr Cassidy: Gall Cadw fod yn ddiamddiffyn \nsort of position because we are quite a small mewn sefyllfa o’r fath gan ein bod yn sefydliad \norganisation, about a third the size of Historic eithaf bach, tua thraean maint Historic \nScotland.

What plans \nsydd gennych i ailystyried yr arfer hwn yng do you have to reconsider this practice in the \nngoleuni’r cyngor cyfreithiol, ym mharagraff light of the legal advice, in paragraph 3.27, \n3.27, a gafodd Swyddfa Archwilio received by the National Audit Office Wales \nGenedlaethol Cymru fod gennych y disgresiwn that you have the necessary discretion to vary \nangenrheidiol i amrywio’r modd y caiff the timing of grant conditions? \namodau grant eu hamseru?

Yr wyf yn the grant is first offered. I am glad that you are \nfalch eich bod am newid y system. going to change that system. \nMae gennyf gwestiwn ychwanegol ynglyn â’r I have a supplementary question regarding the \nsystem dendro ar gyfer grant. A yw ymgeiswyr tendering system for grants. Do applicants \nyn cael canllawiau pendant ynglyn â’r modd y receive definite guidelines regarding the way \ndylent dendro am waith? A yw hyn bob amser they should tender for work? Is this always \nyn gystadleuol? Deallaf eu bod yn derbyn y competitive?

Y mae enghreifftiau o bobl—yr to do the work. There are examples of \nymgeiswyr eu hunain—yn gwneud y gwaith people—the applicants themselves—carrying \nam y pris a roddwyd. A yw hyn yn eich poeni out the work for the price that was given. Is \nchi, oherwydd efallai fod lle i dwyll ddigwydd that of concern to you, because there is room \ngyda system mor llac? for fraud to occur within such a lax system? \nMr Cassidy: There are examples—not Mr Cassidy: Mae yna enghreifftiau—prin \nmany—in which an applicant has undertaken iawn—lle mae ymgeisydd wedi ymgymryd â’r \nthe work, but in those cases we impose gwaith, ond yn yr achosion hynny yr ydym yn \nadditional checks by requiring the employment gosod gwiriadau ychwanegol drwy fynnu \nof a quantity surveyor who will survey the cyflogi syrfëwr meintiau a fydd yn arolygu’r \nwork in progress and give Cadw the necessary gwaith fydd yn mynd rhagddo ac yn rhoi’r \ninformation to ensure that value for money has wybodaeth angenrheidiol i Cadw i sicrhau y \nbeen gained.

Pam felly? \nwas that? \n  \n  \nMr Cassidy: I think that in its reply to that, the Mr Cassidy: Yn ei hateb i hynny, credaf fod y \nGovernment pointed out that English Heritage Llywodraeth wedi nod nad yw English \nand Cadw are not in a position to take a local Heritage a Cadw mewn sefyllfa i gymryd \nland charge, which was the preferred course.

That galluogi Cadw ac English Heritage i gymryd \nwas the preferred course. Legislation has not pridiant o’r fath. Dyna oedd y dewis mwyaf \noccurred. We need to rethink it. It will be very dymunol.

Peter Black: Are you aware that there are Peter Black: A ydych yn ymwybodol bod \nother ways of registering a land charge? For ffyrdd eraill o gofrestru pridiant tir? Er \ninstance, in the event of unregistered property, enghraifft, yn achos eiddo heb ei gofrestru, \nyou can register a land charge with the Land gallwch gofrestru pridiant tir gyda’r Gofrestrfa \nCharges Registry in Plymouth, which will Pridiannau Tir yn Plymouth a fydd yn diogelu \nprotect your interest and protect the grant eich buddiannau ac yn diogelu’r amodau grant \nconditions and ensure that, in the event of the ac yn sicrhau, os caiff yr eiddo ei werthu, y \nproperty being sold, you will be notified and cewch eich hysbysu o hynny ac y rhoddir cyfle \ngiven an opportunity to actually claw back ichi adfachu eich grant. Felly hefyd, yn achos \nyour grant. Similarly, in the event of registered eiddo cofrestredig, fe gewch y cyfle i gofrestru \nproperty, you do have the opportunity to naill ai cyfyngiad neu rybudd yn y gofrestrfa \nregister at the land registry either a restriction dir i ddiogelu eich buddiannau.

The National Trust is extremely grateful to the National Assembly for Wales Audit Committee for the opportunity to be able to comment \non the deliberations regarding the current funding arrangements for Chirk Castle. \nThere are a number of points which the National Trust would like to comment on both for clarification and \nby way of additional information: \n1. It is important to reinforce the point that the National Trust would not have accepted Chirk Castle in \n1981 without assurances on its long term funding. If the legally binding guarantee had not been given \nthen Chirk Castle and its management would have remained a Welsh Office responsibility. \n2. The National Trust feels that it is unfortunate that the annual maintenance funding for Chirk is included \nwithin Cadw’s overall budget, and is regarded as a sum of money which is competing with building \ngrants. It is important to distinguish between the two entirely separate purposes. We believe that the \nannual maintenance support funding should be extracted out of the building grants budget. \n3. A further concern of the current funding arrangements is that it fails to recognise that the Chirk Castle \nproperty is more than a building. Chirk also includes important contents, an award winning garden and a \nGrade I Listed Parkland. Addressing the management obligations, of these wider significances and \nresponsibilities has in part contributed to the costs of management rising greater than inflation, and wage \ncosts particularly, in strengthening the gardening and wardening staff. Further cost increases have come \nabout as a consequence of changes in employment legislation, costs associated with Health and Safety, \nEnvironmental Health and greater than inflationary increases in building costs. \n4. Cadw informed the Committee that in the current financial year, of the £2.8 million grants awarded to \nindividual buildings, some £500,000 to £600,000 of the total budget was awarded to the National Trust. \nThis is because the National Trust has a high proportion of the number of Grade I listed buildings in \nWales open to the public. Taken together with its status as a charity it is predictable that it should be a \nmajor beneficiary of grants. It should also be recognised that grants are awarded to buildings not to \norganisations or individuals. \n5. The National Trust is concerned that the National Audit Office report is recommending that Cadw \nshould review Historic Building grants and that Chirk Castle should be denied the benefit of them. The \nReserve Fund, which is currently being established, is some considerable way short of providing \nadequate funding to support future capital works. Recently, for example, it has been reduced to under £1 \nmillion to fund the balance for conservation repairs of the main Gates and Screens and the Phase XI \nrepair works on the East Wing of the Castle. If Chirk Castle is denied the benefit of Historic Building \ngrants then the accumulated Reserve Fund would be unable to meet the capital repair needs on a \nsustainable basis. If the Fund was exhausted then capital repairs would need to be dealt with on a 100% \nfunding basis, as was explained by Mr Cassidy at the Audit Committee. Both the National Trust and \nCadw believe that the current funding arrangement is more realistic and far-sighted. \n6. The National Trust noted the comments made regarding the issue of Member Visit Credits and \nwhether they should be included as income within the calculation of the annual maintenance funding. If \nthey were to be included then a consequence would be that the Reserve Fund, which was established by \nmutual agreement between the National Trust and Cadw to fund future capital works, would grow at a \nmuch slower pace, and Cadw would be faced with the prospect of a higher level of building grants to \nfuture capital repairs. This could have the long-term effect of increasing the burden on the taxpayer. 7. Monies received by the National Trust from Cadw to meet the annual maintenance funding subsidise \nthe running of Chirk, but the National Trust does not profit thereby. There is no question of any monies \neither earned at Chirk or coming in by way of support or grants being siphoned away from Chirk. \n8. The National Trust is very aware of its obligations to manage Chirk Castle in a frugal and business-like \nway, and to regularly examine opportunities for generating greater income and containing costs. We \nwould therefore be very happy to meet with Cadw to explore with them what opportunities there might be \nfor reducing the annual maintenance support. The Trust’s experience, however, is that such properties \nare very expensive to run, and income generated from visitors will never come near to meeting such \ncosts. \n9. The National Trust would not want the Audit Committee to regard the 20% management fee charge, \nwhich is included by the National Trust within the expenditure accounts, as of no benefit to Chirk. There \nare many specialist services which are provided to Chirk from The National Trust in Wales and \nelsewhere. This includes technical expertise in building maintenance, conservation, archaeology, finance, \nmarketing and communications, garden management, woodland management and nature conservation. \nThat Chirk is able to bring in services, where total costs are spread across all properties in Wales \nrepresents best value for money. \nThe alternatives would be to employ such expertise at the property or bring in externally, both of which \nwould be considerably more expensive. \nIn conclusion, the National Trust would like to re-emphasise that it is not in a position to re-negotiate the \nterms of the 1981 Agreement in a way which would prejudice the support funding arrangements for Chirk \nCastle. We will work very closely with Cadw to ensure that the level of support is appropriate to provide \nfor the proper management of Chirk Castle on a sustainable basis. The National Trust believes that the \ncurrent support represents excellent value for money to the taxpayer. Chirk Castle, its garden and \ngrounds attract between 70-80,000 visitors each year. It employs 9 full time staff and 22 part-time and \nseasonal staff as well as over 200 volunteers. Indirectly many others seek part of their livelihood from \nworking at Chirk such as tenants and contractors. Over 6000 schoolchildren visit Chirk and partake in its \naward winning education programme. These are some of the benefits that Chirk Castle gives to the \nnation and why we believe that the current taxpayers investment is good value for money. \nAgain, I would like to thank the Audit Committee for affording the National Trust the opportunity to \nrespond to the deliberations on Chirk Castle. It has helped us to be able to do this and we very much \nhope that it has helped you. \nYours sincerely \n  \nPeter Broomhead \nDirector for Wales \n(Back to contents)   \nANNEX C \n \nCADW \nWELSH HISTORIC MONUMENTS \n  \nEich Cyfeirnod \nMr A George   \nYour Reference \nClerk to the Audit Committee \nNational Assembly of Wales \n  \nEin Cyfeirnod \nCardiff Bay \nOur Reference \n  \nDyddiad \nDate \n8 December 1999 \nLlinell Uniongyrchol 01222 \n82 \n6599 \nDirect Line 01222 82 \n  \nPROTECTING AND CONSERVING THE BUILT HERITAGE OF WALES \nThe Committee asked me to produce a note on the impact of changes within Cadw likely to arise from of \nthe Auditor General for Wales’s report. In general the recommendations should help to improve the \neffectiveness of Cadw’s performance and - in particular - help us to wring more added value from the \ngrants budget. It is difficult to try to quantify the benefit in cash, but wherever possible I have suggested \nsome broad indicators. The calculations are, however, based upon a number of assumptions and there is \na limit to how rigorous they can be. The costs of implementing the recommendations are more tangible, \nbut are not likely to be great. \nRecommendation 1: Cadw should undertake a check of spot listed buildings in resurveyed areas \nto monitor contractors’ performance. \nOver a 21 month period the NAO noted 14 spot listing cases which they thought should have been \npicked up when the communities were resurveyed. That suggests a figure of eight per annum. The unit cost of spot listing is around £150 and so the associated annual expenditure would have been in the \nregion of £1,200. \nCost Benefit \nMinimal - NAO suggest reissuing guidance to A 20% improvement in performance would save £240 \ncontractors (which wedo periodically as a matter of per annum; a 50% improvement £600; and a 100% \ncourse)and replicating the sort of check which they improvement (eliminatingcases of spot listing in \ncarried out is a simple exercise. resurveyed communities altogether) £1,200. \nRecommendation 2: Cadw should seek more specific advice from financial appraisals in order to \ninform their judgement about the level of grant support required by the applicant for the project to \nproceed. \nSuch information will inform the decision on the appropriate amount of grant, which may need to provide \nan incentive as well as compensate for insufficient means. Cadw is extending the number of grants \nsubject to financial appraisal on a trial basis. \nCost Benefit \nThe direct unit cost of a financial appraisal is It is not possible to deduce an aggregate sum, but in \naround £200. larger cases we would expect a financial appraisal to \nrepay its cost by a significant factor, and better \ntargeting will allow us to accommodate more cases. \nRecommendation 3: Cadw should review whether further grant support for Chirk Castle, beyond \nthat to which they are legally bound, is appropriate. \nA review of all aspects of financial arrangements at Chirk is planned, which will encompass historic \nbuildings grant. There is no legal commitment to provide historic buildings grant for capital works at Chirk, \nbut no grants have been offered or paid unless the project met the criteria of the scheme and could - for \nexample - have been assisted had any other applicant put it forward. The effect of denying the National \nTrust access to historic buildings grant at Chirk would be to redistribute the budget. \nRecommendation 4: Cadw should ensure that claw-back applies for 10 years from the date of \npayment. \nIn the past Cadw has started the 10 year clock from the date of offer - on average it might be another \ntwelve months before the works are undertaken and the grant paid, so the effect of adopting this \nrecommendation would be to add to the sum subject to claw back in any given case. Cost Benefit \nNone Cases of claw back are not a regular occurrence - in \nsome years there may be none - and so it is not \npossible to identify an annual sum. However, had the \nproposed terms applied in the case described at \nparagraph 3.33 of the NAO Report, an additional \n£5,850 or thereabouts would be subject to claw \nback. \n  \nRecommendations 5 to 7: Cadw should: \n     give high priority to improving their management information on grants; \n     broaden their monitoring system to encompass all grant cases to which conditions still \napply; and \n     check ownership at the Land Registry in cases where attempts to contact owners are \nunsuccessful. \nCadw’s management information on grants is currently paper-based. All grants made since 1996 are \nmonitored, and pre-1996 cases on a sample basis. The computerisation of Cadw records will better \nenable the effective monitoring of all extant cases. \nCost Benefit \nRecognition of Cadw’s IT requirements The prospect exists of identifying additional cases \npredates the NAO study and does not reflect a which should be subject to claw back; and improving \ncost arising from it. Computerisation should the chance of recovery by more rapid action on the \nenable Cadw to implement the basis of fuller information. Extrapolating from the \nrecommendations on monitoring within proportion of cases monitored and the incidence of \nexisting staff resources. Land Registry checks claw back, the predictable savings may lie in the \nare inexpensive - £4 per property region of £2,000-£5,000. But large cases with a \nmajor financial impact - such as that identified by \nNAO at paragraph 3.33 involving claw back of nearly \n£60,000 - may occur from time to time. \nRecommendations 8 to 10: Cadw should: \n     require recipients to supply, as part of their annual monitoring procedures, copies of \nadvertisements placed in publications; \n     consider testing access arrangements in practice; and \n     register any complaints received from members of the public failing to gain access and \nrecord the results of subsequent investigations. \nllllllIn order to put a financial value on the recommendations, it is necessary to \"price\" public access - one of \nthe benefits which grants are intended to confer - and adopt a view about the potential for public access \nwhich remains untapped. Grant aided buildings not regularly open to the public tend to be churches \n(often locked for security reasons) and private dwellings. The rate of historic buildings grant for eligible \nworks is 50% in the case of churches and 40% for private dwellings. In the case of conservation area \ngrant, the rates are 40% and 30% respectively. Conservation area grant differs principally from historic \nbuildings grant in that public access is not a requirement - so the difference between the two rates (one-\nfifth for churches and one-fourth for private dwellings) could be said to reflect the value placed upon \npublic access. In 1998-99 Cadw paid grants of around £800k to churches - one-fifth is £160k. Around \n£700k was provided to projects involving private dwellings - one-quarter is £175k. In total, the cash value \nof public access would have been in the region of £335k - a third of a million pounds. \nCadw takes a number of measures to publicise access requirements, and the NAO make no \nrecommendations for improvement. The other half of the equation is the owner of the grant aided \nproperty - and it may be that a more systematic approach to the requirements which we place upon them \ncould double the potential for visitor numbers generated by their own advertising efforts. This would \nsuggest that about a quarter of the annual cash benefit associated with public access (around £80,000) \nremains to be realised. \n  \nCost Benefit \nIt may be that efficiency savings arising from Realising 20% of the untapped potential would be \ncomputerisation will enable Cadw not only to equivalent in cash terms to £16k, 50% to £40k and \nextend monitoring but to enforce compliance 100% to £80k. \nand take remedial action within existing \nresources. At most, the cost of implementing \nthe recommendations is unlikely to exceed the \ncost of an additional Administrative Officer \n(around £15,000) plus the cost of testing \naccess arrangements in practice. We intend to \ndo so by contracting with an established \nvoluntary organisation to test access to 30 \nproperties a year at £40 per visit, total £1,200. \nConclusions \nCadw believes that in the medium term the implementation of conclusions and recommendations \nidentified by the Auditor General for Wales would involve minimal costs and achieve a significant net \nincrease in value for money, expressed in terms of a fuller realisation of Cadw’s objectives. \n  \nT J CASSIDY Chief Executive \n(Back to contents) \n  \nANNEX D \nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE \nThe National Assembly's Audit Committee ensures that proper and thorough scrutiny is given to the \nAssembly’s expenditure.

There was an 84 percent clearance.\n\n\nThe Cape Wools Overall Merino Indicator gained 2.1 percent moving from 2,778 SA cents to 2,835 SA cents, despite the rand surging to its best levels in over 45 months against major currencies.\n\n\nCurrencies & Stock Markets\nThis week the Australian dollar was trading at around A$2.33/£.  The New Zealand dollar was trading at around NZ$2.67/£.  \n\n\nAustralian Wool Supplies Forecast to Decline whilst Wool Ratios Improve\n“Australian shorn-wool production is forecast to decline by 14% to 430 million kg greasy during the 2003/04 season, according to the Australian Wool Innovation production forecasting committee.  The estimate is 10 million kg greasy lower than the September forecast of 440 million kg and compares with a revised estimate for the 2002/03 season of 499 million greasy.\n\n\nThe fall in wool values in recent months and the rise in cotton and man-made fibre prices have significantly improved the price competitiveness of apparel wool according to the Woolmark Company.  Relative to a basket of man-made fibres wool fell from 4.8 to 3.6 year on year. WRWMR\n\n\nFWG Agency\nSpeciality scouring supply interest received this week.\n\n\nMy December Visit Itinerary currently is as follows: 15th: Arrive MPA; 16th Stanley Meetings; 17th Fly to Port Edgar and stay at South Harbour; 18th to Fox Bay, staying at Coast Ridge; 19th to Hill Cove via Sheffield, staying at The Peaks; 20th Fly to Stanley; North Camp 21st staying at Mount Kent; 22nd staying at Hope Cottage; 23rd to be advised; 24th – 29th Stanley; 30th Depart MPA.  My very grateful thanks to those people kindly having me to stay.  Please make arrangements with me/my hosts to meet me if you are able to.\n\n\nWith Thanks and Regards\nRobert\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<< First <  Previous\tArticle 159 of 215\nwithin Agriculture\tNext > Last >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t       Powered by NIC.SH\tCopyright © 1993-2010 SARTMA.com\tDesign by CrownNet       \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Toulouse.\n\n\"We are the ones who are going to break the rules and the control of the old system. We are the new alternative\".\n\nAcross Europe, victims of the economic slump who are losing their jobs in their tens of thousands are furious that public money is being doled out to the banks.\n\nIn some countries, they are more willing to vent their anger.\n\nAs huge crowds took to the streets across France this week, in a national day of protests and strikes, the far left points to a boost in the number of its supporters in times of financial gloom.\n\nThe French communist movement has remained a significant political force even in the decades when their cause was less than fashionable abroad.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWe are seeing a radicalisation...

And they see an opportunity.\n\nMarine and her fellow party-member, Hugo, who is 18, do not envisage a violent revolution.\n\n\"There is no need for guns or bullets,\" says Hugo, \"just a realisation that the situation is not fair, that all the state's money is being spent on the people who need it the least.\"\n\nStephane Borras, who is one of the group's organisers and a candidate to lead a new party that is being formed under the banner of anti-capitalism, says attitudes are changing.\n\n\"We are seeing a radicalisation, perhaps the beginning of a very big movement. I am not a clairvoyant, but I live in France, I have a lot of contacts with a wide range of people and it's not just leftists, not just militants who cannot accept the injustice. Inequality is growing in Europe and inequality is always the cause of revolt\".\n\nDesperate times\n\nAll three campaigners stress the need to forge an effective alliance between the workers and with the downtrodden youth of the suburbs because, as they put it, \"that's what the government fears the most\".\n\nUp until now, the rioters of the \"banlieues\", who made headlines with the damage they caused to parts of Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon and Toulouse a couple of years ago, have failed to find effective common cause with the students and intellectuals of the left.\n\nBut as times get more desperate for more people, that could change.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                            \n\t\t\t                    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWe need to learn from the past - our job as criminologists is to read the books and notice that something is going on\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\tAlain Bauer\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t            \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, ministers in Paris are wary of some form of insurrection.\n\nRecent intelligence reports talk about an \"elevated threat\" from an \"international European networkâ¦ with a strong presence in France\" and a \"new generation of activists\", possibly a \"re-birth of the violent extreme left\".\n\nA spokesman for the interior ministry, Gerard Gachet, told the BBC that the threat was real.\n\n\"The term 'ultra-left' was used by the interior minister to set this group apart from the extreme left who turn up for elections and keep within the parameters of democratic debate,\" he says.\n\nBut talking of more radical groups, he points to recent pamphlets and books published anonymously, but sometimes with a circulation of about 20,000, with titles such as How to Start a Civil War and The Insurrection That is Coming.\n\n\"They say that the fires of revolt will spread everywhere,\" he says, \"and we see acts like damage to bank branches or state buildings and claims of solidarity with the Greek rioters.\n\n\"So there is undoubtedly a threat which needs to be taken into accountâ¦ This is not about criminalising opinions. Everyone has the right to an opinion. It is about making sure that illegal actions do not take placeâ¦. In any case, we can be extremely vigilant. We have surveillance and intelligence teams.\"\n\n'New level'\n\nAlain Bauer, who is a criminologist from the Sorbonne University in Paris and a writer on terrorism, says alarm bells should be ringing, and makes a comparison with the situation 30 years ago.\n\n\"Action Directe and the Red Brigades appeared then in two distinct stages,\" he asserts.\n\n\"Stage one was purely intellectual, with no attempt at violence. Stage two was plots, assassinations and violence.\n\n\"We need to learn from the past. When you write a paper on how to start a civil war, how to destroy public amenities and power supplies, this is very different. You are potentially taking things to a new level.\n\n\"Our job as criminologists is to read the books and notice that something is going on\".\n\n\n\n\n                        \n \nBookmark with:\n

The study takes a unique look at the policies and environmental impacts of the past 30 years. It then outlines four policy approaches for the next three decades and compares and contrasts the likely impacts on people and the natural world.\n\nGEO-3 reports that improvements have occurred in river and air quality in places like North America and Europe. The international effort to repair the ozone layer, the Earth's protective shield, by reducing the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is another notable success. But generally there has been a steady decline in the environment over the last 30 years, especially across large parts of the developing world.\n\n\nThe declining environmental quality of planet Earth and the apparent increase in strength and frequency of natural hazards such as cyclones, floods and droughts are intensifying peoples' vulnerability to food insecurity, ill health and unsustainable livelihoods, says the report. The poor, the sick and the disadvantaged, both within societies and in different countries and regions, are particularly vulnerable. \n\n\nGEO-3 1972-2002: past and present\n\n\n\n\tLand - The main driving force, putting pressure on land resources, has been the growing global population. There are 2,220 million more mouths to feed than there were in 1972.\n\n\n\n\tIn the Asia and Pacific region, the area of land under irrigation has risen from under 125 million hectares (ha) in 1972 to over 175 million ha. Excessive and poorly managed irrigation can degrade soils through impacts such as salinization - a build up of salts. Over 10 per cent, between 25 and 30 million ha, of the world's irrigated lands are classed as severely degraded as a result.\n\n\n\n\tSoil erosion is a key factor in land degradation. Around 2 billion ha of soil, equal to 15 per cent of the Earth's land cover or an area bigger than the United States and Mexico combined, is now classed as degraded as a result of human activities.\n\n\n\n\tOvergrazing is causing 35 per cent of soil degradation; deforestation, 30 per cent; agriculture, 27 per cent; overexploitation of vegetation, 7 per cent and industrial activities, 1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\tA feature of the past 30 years has been the rise of urban agriculture. It is practised by most households in South East Asia and Pacific Islands. About 30 per cent of the Russian Federation's food comes from 3 per cent of suburban land. An estimated 65 per cent of Moscow's population engage in urban agriculture, up from a fifth in the early 1970s.\n\n\n\nFreshwater\n\n\n\n\tAround half of the world's rivers are seriously depleted and polluted. About 60 per cent of the world's largest 227 rivers have been strongly or moderately fragmented by dams and other engineering works.\n\n\n\n\tSome 80 countries, amounting to 40 per cent of the world's population, were suffering serious water shortages by the mid-1990s. Around 1.1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water and 2.4 billion to improved sanitation, mainly in Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\n\tWater-related disease costs are high: Two billion people are at risk from malaria alone, with 100 million affected at any one time and up to 2 million deaths annually. There are about 4 billion cases of diarrhoea and 2.2 million deaths a year, equivalent to 20 jumbo jets crashing everyday.\n\n\n\n\tIntestinal worm infections afflict 10 per cent of people in the developing world. Around 6 million people are blind from trachoma, a contagious eye disease. Some 200 million are affected by schistosomiasis which causes bilharzia in humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite image of smoke from Indonesian forest fires, October 1997. Credit: UNEP\n\nForests and Biodiversity\n\n\n\n\tThe Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that forests, which cover around a third of the Earth's land surface or 3,866 million ha, have declined by 2.4 per cent since 1990. \n\n\n\n\tThe biggest losses have been in Africa where 52.6 million ha or 0.7 per cent of its forest cover has gone in the past decade.\n\nGlobal production of roundwood reached 3,335 million cubic metres of which around half was for fuel, especially in developed countries.\n\n\n\n\tMangrove forests, natural sea defences, nursery grounds for fish and prime nesting and resting sites for migratory birds, are threatened by impacts such as over-harvesting for timber and fuel wood, tourism and coastal developments. Up to 50 per cent of recent mangrove destruction has been due to clear cutting for shrimp farms.\n\n\n\n\tThe loss and fragmentation of habitats such as forests, wetlands and mangrove swamps have increased the pressures on the world's wildlife.\n\n\n\n\tTwelve per cent or 1,183 of birds and nearly a quarter or 1,130 mammals are currently regarded as globally threatened.\n\n\n\n\tThe introduction of alien species from one part of the world to another has emerged as a significant threat in recent years alongside climate change. Alien species often have no natural predators in their new homes and can out-compete native species for breeding and feeding sites.\n\n\n\nCoasts and oceans\n\n\n\n\tBy 1994, an estimated 37 per cent of the global human population was living within 60 kilometres of the coast. This is more than the number of people alive on the planet in 1950.\n\n\n\n\tGlobally, sewage is the largest source of contamination by volume with discharges from developing countries on the rise as a result of rapid urbanization, population growth and a lack of planning and financing for sewerage systems and water treatment plants.\n\n\n\n\tOther threats to the oceans include climate change, oil spills, discharges of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and litter. Sedimentation, as a result of coastal developments, agriculture and deforestation, has become a major global threat to coral reefs particularly in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and South and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\tJust under a third of the world's fish stocks are now ranked as depleted, overexploited or recovering as a result of over-fishing fueled by subsidies estimated at up to US$20 billion annually.\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n\n\n\n\tDepletion of the ozone layer, which protects life from damaging ultraviolet light, has now reached record levels. In September 2000, the ozone hole over Antarctica covered more than 28 million square kilometres.\n\n\n\n\tConcentrations of carbon dioxide, the main gas linked with global warming, currently stand at 370 parts per million or 30 per cent higher than in 1750. Concentrations of other greenhouse gases, such as methane and halocarbons, have also risen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"GEO-3 is neither a document of doom and gloom or a gloss over the acute challenges facing us all,\" said Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of the UNEP, at thge launch of the report in London in May. \"It is the most authoritative assessment of where we have been, where we have reached and where we are likely to go. The facts in the report underline the huge amount of knowledge that has now been accumulated about the condition of Earth...\n\n\n\"We now have hundreds of declarations, agreements, guidelines and legally binding treaties designed to address environmental problems and the threats they pose to wildlife and human health and well being.  Let us now find the political courage and the innovative financing needed to implement these deals and steer a healthier, more prosperous, course for planet Earth...\n\n\n\"Environment for Development is UNEP's motto, for without the environment there can never be the kind of development needed to secure a fair deal for this or future generations. We need concrete actions, we need concrete timetables and we need an iron will from all sides. It cannot be the responsibility of politicians alone. We are all shareholders in this enterprise. Only then can the promises made in Rio turn into a reality,\" said Mr Toepfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to the GEO-3 Report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t© People & the Planet 2000\n - 2010\t\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tpicture gallery\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tprintable version\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\temail a friend\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tLatest Newsfile\n\t\tEU recommends tuna fishing ban - with strings\n\n\n\tWorld's primates on the brink of extinction\n\n\n\tNew hope in the year of the (dwindling) tiger\n\n\n\tMekong tigers plummet to only 350 \n\n\n\tMadagascar's political chaos threatens conservation gains\n\n\n\t2010: International Year of Biodiversity\n\n\n\tIUCN names species threatened by climate change\n\n\n\tAsian vultures on brink of disaster\n\n\n\tEvolutionary treasure house of Galapagos faces devastation\n\n\n\tRed List shows mounting extinction crisis\n\n\n\tNewly discovered species threatened by climate change \n\n\n\tExtinction threat to Mediterranean mammals\n\n\n\tHalf EU species are in poor shape\n\n\n\tCosta Rica tops Happy Planet Index \n\n\n\tEU bans seal products\n\n\n\tBrazil’s endemic plant life on the verge of a mass extinction\n\n\n\tNew Russian Arctic Park to protect key polar bear habitat\n\n\n\tEurope’s amphibians and reptiles under threat\n\n\n\tLoggers ready to assault orang utan sanctuary\n\n\n\tAfghanistan declares its first national park\n\n\n\tSPECIAL REPORT:\nHuman pressures destroying Masai Mara wildlife\n\n\n\tMuslim preachers join fight against poachers\n\n\n\tArctic nations  strengthen pledge to  polar bear survival\n\n\n\tStudy reveals war's devastating impact  on nature \n\n\n\tMore of world's birds threatened with extinction\n\n\n\tTuna quota still 'too big to save species'\n\n\n\tAfrica's first transfrontier marine park\n\n\n\tEfforts to save tuna fisheries so far a 'total failure'\n\n\n\tSmall whales rapidly disappearing from world's oceans \n\n\n\tA third of shark species threatened with extinction\n\n\n\tBrazil's biggest  coral reef  gets protective boost\n\n\n\tSpecies survey  boosts Scottish reforestation plans\n\n\n\tSUCCESS STORY:\nA Mexican village cleans up the plastic tide\n\n\n\tUS biodiversity centre to hand out free condoms \n\nMore articles in our Archive\n\t2009\n\n\t2008\n\n\t2007\n\n\t2006\n\n\t2005\n\n\t2004\n\n\t2003\n\n\t2002\n\n\t2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPlease support this website by making a donation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details of how you can help, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\ncontact us\n | \nsite map\n | \n©\t\t\n\n\t \t overview | newsfile | books | films | links | factfile | features | glossary \n\n\n\n\t\tpeopleandplanet.net\t\n\t\n\tdesigned & powered by tincan ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Mae’r cynllun yn cynnwys camau i sicrhau y byddwn yn parhau i helpu’r \nchwe chanolfan atgyfeirio ymosodiadau rhywiol sydd wedi’u sefydlu yng Nghymru.\n\n\n\t\tCwestiynau i’r Gweinidog dros Blant, Addysg, Dysgu Gydol Oes a Sgiliau\n\n\t\t\t\tPobl nad ydynt mewn Addysg, Cyflogaeth na Hyfforddiant \n\n\n\tC12 Mohammad Asghar: A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddatganiad am nifer y bobl ifanc yng Nghymru a ddynodwyd yn bobl nad ydynt mewn addysg, cyflogaeth na hyfforddiant (NEET)? OAQ(3)1307(CEL)\n\n\n\tY Gweinidog dros Blant, Addysg a Dysgu Gydol Oes (Leighton Andrews): Mae data’r arolwg yn dangos nad oedd 12.0 y cant o bobl ifanc 16 i 18 oed (14,000 o unigolion) mewn addysg, cyflogaeth na hyfforddiant ar gyfer y flwyddyn a ddaeth i ben yn chwarter \n3 yn 2009, o’i gymharu â 12.3 y cant ar gyfer y flwyddyn a ddaeth i ben yn chwarter 3 yn 2008. Mae data o ysgolion yng Nghymru yn dangos nad oedd tua 6 y cant o ymadawyr blwyddyn 11 (2,130 o unigolion) yn 2009 mewn addysg, cyflogaeth na hyfforddiant \nddiwedd mis Hydref 2009, o’i gymharu â 7 y cant y flwyddyn flaenorol.\n\n\n\tLlywodraethu Ysgolion\n\n\n\tC13 Darren Millar : A wnaiff y Gweinidog ddatganiad am lywodraethu ysgolion? OAQ(3)1320(CEL)\n\n\n\tLeighton Andrews: Mae llywodraethu ysgolion yn rhan bwysig ac annatod o’r system addysg. Mae llywodraethu da’n sail i ysgolion effeithiol a safonau perfformiad a chyrhaeddiad uchel i ddysgwyr. Yr wyf yn croesawu’r cyfraniad y mae \nllywodraethwyr yn ei wneud. Yr wyf hefyd yn croesawu cymeradwyo’r Gorchymyn cymhwysedd deddfwriaethol ar lywodraethu ysgolion.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTynnwyd cwestiwn 14, OAQ(3)1324(CEL), yn ôl.\n\n\t\t\t\tCyllid Tymor Canolig\n\n\n\tC15 Jenny Randerson: Pa asesiad y mae’r Gweinidog wedi’i wneud o gyllid tymor canolig ar gyfer addysg yng Nghymru? OAQ(3)1308(CEL)\n\n\n\tLeighton Andrews: Yr ydym yn gwybod ein bod yn wynebu cyfres gynyddol dynn o gyllidebau yn ystod y blynyddoedd nesaf, ond ein bwriad yw diogelu gwasanaethau rheng flaen, gan gynnwys addysg. Dyna pam yr wyf wedi galw am yr adolygiad o gost gweinyddu addysg a \nbyddaf yn ystyried ein cyllidebau  ar gyfer y dyfodol yn ystod y misoedd nesaf.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\tNôl i rhestr dogfennau\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n            \n\t\t\t\tLlywodraeth Cynulliad Cymru|Hygyrchedd|Cymorth|Map o´r Wefan|Polisi Preifatrwydd|Telerau ac Amodau \n            \n\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n        \n       \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n        \t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n",

New during 2008 was the new-look BGA website, with a modern feel, menus and search\nfacilities to aid navigation. Many new people were again introduced to Go during the year\nand continually more and more Go is played on-line. Unfortunately, despite growth in player\nnumbers, the number of registered members fell during the year.\n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n        \n\n\n          \tRead more\n\n\n\n      \n\n   \n     \n\n\n\n\n    Last updated Sat Jan 30 2010.

Guido emailed asking if he was persona non grata.  No reply.  Oh well.  Carry on as normal, it won’t matter much if Guido doesn’t know Peter Ainsworth’s latest green thoughts or Andrew Mitchell’s travel arrangements.  That was until Guido missed an official comment from Dave on the MEPs, so Guido called the Tory press office, was assured that there had been some changes to the distribution list and keeping Guido in the dark was an error that would be rectified.   Another phone call emphasised that it was now fixed.\nNo press releases followed.  Weeks go by.  Is it a conspiracy of silence, has Caroline Spelman exacted revenge?  Is it a competence issue?  This kind of thing never happens to Iain Dale…\n\nUPDATE : Tim Montgomerie of ConservativeHome says he has been cut out as well.   We’re not talking about the guff sent to supporters, we’re talking about the media releases.  If it is deliberate, it is pretty short-sighted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: CCHQ\n\nJune 11, 2008 at 8:15 am\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiary Change\n\n\n\n\nOn the Indy’s Pandora column Olly Duff is moving to the news desk.  So he clearly didn’t disgrace himself  too much in the eyes of Roger Alton at the leaving moving party for Simon Kelner.  The gossip column will be left in the hands of Henry Deedes.  Floreat Etona!\nOver at The Times Hugo Rifkind is moving to features and apparently there may be no successor gossip column in the newspaper (although there seems to be one today, by-lined Adam Sherwin with a familiar story about Nadine employing her daughter).   The editor obviously aims to boost sales by making the paper even less entertaining.\n\nKaty-Taylor Richards is no longer a gossip columnist and is now a serious lobby journalist she tells Guido.  Which is very confusing, because she writes for the Daily Express.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Dead Tree Press\n\nJune 11, 2008 at 7:15 am\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, June 10, 2008\n\n\nRuth Turner Fundraising for Blair Again\n\n\n\n\nActually, she is doing it for charidee – the Tony Blair Sports Foundation.

Speculation is rising.\nThe job is not what it was in the glory days of Parkinson and Tebbit.  Ashcroft’s team does process and the nitty gritty of the campaign machine in marginals, Osborne is charge of general election strategy.  Betting is on Eric Pickles or Chris Grayling.  Both popular with the activists, Pickles is adored and is basking in the post by-election glory.  Grayling is fantastically good at taking the fight to Labour.  He isn’t afraid of Paxman and comes over well on the news shows.  Spelman on the other hand has only registered with the public now and for the wrong reasons…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: CCHQ\n\nJune 10, 2008 at 9:41 am\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do Political Insiders Say All Parties Fear Sleaze Charges? Because They Are All At It\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the latest PoliticsHome “Insider Panel” two thirds think all parties have something to fear from Euro-sleaze allegations. The insiders know what Guido has always said is true – they are all at it. Taxpayer’s money is being spent on ensuring parasite politicians can employ their spouses, lovers and offspring at the public’s expense. They gentrify their gardens, clean their windows, buy their wives cars, finance trips to their children’s foreign weddings, carry out household repairs, buy themselves plasma TVs and Aga stoves at our expense. When not eating in taxpayer subsidised restaurants they charge their groceries to the taxpayer. Prescott literally gorged himself until he puked, then claimed for the food on expenses – and we paid his residential cleaning bill. Many MPs approaching retirement have gained themselves property portfolios built at the taxpayer’s expense. The politicians who deny themselves personal pork are few and far between.\n\n\n\nThis culture of pork was one of the motivating reasons for Guido setting up this blog. The silence from the political class on this issue is because they really are almost all at it. Millionaires like Clegg and Cameron claim subsidies for their mortgages equivalent to more than most people in this country earn. Even Gordon Brown, who has two gratis homes – Downing Street and Chequers – claims for a London flat and his constituency home.\n\n\n\nThe Spelman saga encapsulates the problem – ignore the excuses about hard pressed mothers – take her at her word. That a politically savvy high flier thought it even remotely possible and ethical that she could pay her nanny at the taxpayers expense is indicative of the culture. Her and her husband could well afford to pay it themselves, millions of us do. No one in the private sector would dream of asking their employer to pay their childcare costs, we pay our own bills out of post tax income and our taxes go to pay their personal expenses tax free. The sheer arrogance of these pigs is breathtaking. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Snouts in the Trough\n\nJune 10, 2008 at 7:43 am\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday, June 9, 2008\n\n\n+++ Den Dover Euro Cash Laundered Into Tory Coffers +++\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Electoral Commission records, Den Dover’s “service provider” company MP Holdings gave Â£1,200 to the North West Tories and printing worth Â£1,701 to the Chorley branch in 2004.   Dover has personally given the party Â£57,000 since 2001.\nIncidentally, Guido has been busy gathering evidence of LibDem and Labour MEPs using European Parliament expense funds in a systematic way to fund their party machines.  So don’t expect to hear much complaining about this from them…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Sleaze\n\nJune 9, 2008 at 9:27 pm\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue-on-Blue or Red Dragons?\n\n\n\n\nPost-lunch Guido peruses Nadine’s blog to discover a picture of her comely researcher, one Jenny Dorries, and Nadine has this to say:\n\nIf Michael Crick or any other journalist would like to check it out she is working from my staff office, just be our guest.  Is there a better communication tool than a blog?\n\nNo of course not, so Guido calls Nadine’s office; “Is Jenny there?”  “No she has just popped out” comes the reply.  Guido leaves his number for her to call back.  Seconds pass… ring, ring.  A lioness roars down the line in tones that remind Guido of Mrs Fawkes.   Nadine is not impressed.  Guido protests that she did invite calls.  She also complains about the blog’s coverage of Caroline Spelman. Guido points out she never called about Guido’s coverage of Beckett’s pergola or Follet’s window cleaning at our expense.  We agree to differ.\n\nElsewhere on her blog Nadine laments\n\n\n“The frenzied attack against Conservative MPs and MEPs, orchestrated by and emanating from the left wing BBC and press has equalled that of an animal in its death throes. The more terminal the position looks for Labour, the more desperate the BBC and left wing press become. The incoming Conservative government has many big dragons to slay, the BBC has to be the biggest.”\n\nYes, Guido and those horrible left-wingers at Open Europe must be desperately trying to prop up the Labour Party.   Guido wonders aloud to Nadine whether, just maybe, Spelman’s troubles might come from another direction, after all, the Whip’s office knew of her misdemeanor, perhaps others in CCHQ knew as well?   Some of those Tory MEPs she was threatening have been around a while, they are not entirely without friends – people do gossip – black books are kept.  Maybe they also knew Michael Crick’s phone number?  Isn’t it more likely to be Blue-on-Blue shooting than originating from the BBC’s red dragons?  Nadine went quiet for a moment… briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: CCHQ, Sleaze, Totty Watch\n\nJune 9, 2008 at 3:08 pm\n\n\nComments Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Will Be Blue Blood On the Floor\n\n\n\n\nGuido has bad news for Tory MEPs caught fiddling their expenses, he is reliably informed that Cameron is inclined to take a tough line on them – including sacking as official candidates – a move that will be hugely popular with grassroots Tories.\nSuch is the strength of feeling in the Conservative Party that outraged Tory councillors and activists in Giles Chichester’s own constituency plan to go public with their disgust if he goes unpunished.  There is unlikely to be much mercy shown to troughing MEPs from Tory MPs in Westminster who resent the luxurious gravy train of their continental counterparts.

Section 77 of the Learning and Skills \nAct (2000) sets out Estyn���s remit to inspect post-16 education and training funded by \nthe National Council for Education and Training for Wales or a local education \nauthority.  Section 76 sets out the Chief Inspector's duty to inform the National \nAssembly of the quality of provision, the standards achieved and where the financial \nresources made available to providers of education and training are managed in a \nway that provides value for money. \n \n2 Her Majesty's Inspectors for Education and Training in Wales and/or additional \ninspectors conduct inspections.  They lead inspection teams and work closely with \npeer assessors from other further education institutions in Wales who take a full part \nin the inspection process.  A nominee from the institution is also a member of the \ninspection team, but does not take part in discussions about grading. \n \n3 Since the incorporation of further education institutions in 1992, there have been two \ninspection cycles.  The current cycle of inspections started in 2002.  The new \ncommon inspection framework is operating across all sectors of Estyn`s work from \nSeptember 2004.  It has been used in further education inspections since 2002.  \n \nScope of reinspections \n \n4 If a programme area is graded 4 or 5, Estyn undertakes reinspection within  \n     12-20 months of the original inspection. \n \n5 If one or more programme areas in an institution have been awarded a grade 4 or 5 \nand all other aspects of provision are satisfactory, only the programme area is re-\ngraded.  Although the generic key questions are not re-graded, judgements on \naspects of teaching, training, assessment, staffing and resources may be included \nwhere they impact upon the standards achieved by learners. \n \n6 If key question 5 is awarded grade 4 or 5, the reinspection will cover this key \nquestion.  Progress made in relation to other key questions will be recorded. \n1 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nContext and scope of the reinspection   \n \n \nBackground to the reinspection \n \n7 In May 2003 Deeside College was inspected.  The inspection covered five \nprogramme areas in addition to the five Key Questions in the common inspection \nframework.  Standards in Welsh for Adults were found to be good, and standards in \nGeneral Education and Tourism and Leisure had good features that outweighed \nshortcomings.  However, standards in Construction and in Business and \nManagement fell below the quality threshold.  Inspectors awarded the following \ngrades. \n \n \nProgramme    Grade\narea \nGeneral Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     3 \nEducation  \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching, training and     2 \nassessment?  \nOverall grade      3 \n \n \nProgramme     Grade\nArea \nTourism and Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     3 \nLeisure  \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching, training and     2 \nassessment?  \nOverall grade      3 \n \n \nProgramme    Grade\narea \nWelsh for Adults Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     2 \n \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching, training and     2 \nassessment?  \nOverall grade      2 \n \n \nProgramme    Grade\narea \nConstruction Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     4 \n \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching, training and     3 \nassessment?  \nOverall grade      4 \n \n2 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \nProgramme area    Grade\nBusiness and Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     4 \nManagement  \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching, training     3 \nand assessment?  \nOverall grade      4 \n \n \nSummary of grades across the college \n \nKey question 3: How well do the learning experiences meet the needs and  \n1 \n                             interests of learners and the wider community?   \nKey question 4: How well are learners cared for, guided and supported? \n2 \n \nKey question 5: How effective are leadership and strategic management? \n3 \n \nKey question 6: How well do leaders and managers evaluate and improve  \n3 \n                             quality and standards? \nKey question 7: How efficient are leaders and managers in using  \n3 \n                             resources? \n \n8 The full report of the inspection of May 2003 can be viewed at www.estyn.gov.uk. \nWhen the overall quality of education and training in a programme area has \nimportant shortcomings, it receives a grade 4 or 5.  The college must develop a \ndetailed action plan to address all the shortcomings identified in the inspection \nreport. \n \n9 Inspectors and peer assessors visited the college in October 2004 to undertake the \nreinspection.  They met with college managers and tutors within the programme \nareas of Business and Management and Construction.  They scrutinised \ndocumentation provided by the college, including the most recent verified data on \nstudent outcomes.  They evaluated samples of students` work and observed \nteaching sessions across all the courses provided by the programme area. Provision \nand facilities were inspected on the main college site and in the community. \n \n10 Following the inspection in May 2003, the college produced a series of action plans \ndesigned to address the shortcomings identified in the original report. Inspectors \nused these as a basis for tracking the actions and for measuring the college's \nsuccess in improving quality.  Inspectors also used the new self-assessment report \nprovided by the college in October 2004 \n3 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nSummary of findings \n \n \n11 The national comparators for 2002-2003, referred to below, are produced by the \nNational Council (ELWa).  They are derived from ELWa`s Individualised Student \nRecords from further education institutions in Wales and are intended for use by \nEstyn in undertaking external inspection.  Institutions also use the information when \nundertaking self-assessments, target-setting and benchmarking.  \n \n12 In  Business and Management, the rates at which learners complete and attain \nqualifications have improved a great deal since the last inspection.  In 2002-2003, \nthe overall successful completion rate for full-time and part-time learners was well \nabove the national comparator.  Unverified college data for 2003-2004 shows this \noverall improvement to be sustained.  Overall, learners are making good progress. \nThey work productively and extend their understanding of relevant vocational \nconcepts.  \n \n13 In  Business and Management, the majority of teaching and work-based sessions \nare good.  All teachers and workplace assessors have very good knowledge of their \nsubjects.  Teachers and work-place assessors structure their sessions well.  They \nuse questioning, and a variety of teaching strategies to good effect.  A new key skills \nteaching strategy has been put in place to improve the integration of key skills into \nlearners��� main programme of study.  Assessment is well planned across college and \nworkplace provision.  Most feedback gives learners clear guidance on how to \nimprove. \n \n14 In  Construction, the rates at which students complete and attain qualifications have \nimproved a great deal since the last inspection.  In most cases they are now above \nnational comparators for 2002-2003.  The unverified attainment rates in 2003-2004 \nare above national comparators in most cases and show continued improvement. \nThe general trend of decline in overall student performance has been addressed.  \n \n15 Overall, in  Construction, learners��� knowledge and their technical and practical skills \nhave all improved.  Learners are now better motivated.  The previously high drop out \nrate from courses has been addressed.  In part this is due to the introduction of new, \nmore relevant courses, particularly at entry level and level one.  Attendance and \npunctuality is good overall.  Learner files are now of a satisfactory standard overall.  \n \n16 In  Construction, although there are general improvements in the quality of teaching, \nin some theory classes, the pace is too slow and there is not enough challenge for \nlearners.  Teachers assess learners` work effectively and the behaviour of learners \nis often good overall. \n4 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \n \n17 Since the publication of the previous report on the May 2003 inspection, the college \nhas analysed the use of workshops and re-organised the provision of support in \nbasic and key skills.  However tutorials are not generally available for part-time \nlearners, and some tutorials do not always make the best use of time to promote \nlearning.  The college has set and met the challenging targets for improvement in \nprogramme areas where standards were previously unsatisfactory.  The corporation \nhas successfully established a curriculum sub-committee to engage more \nsystematically with issues relating to standards and quality.  The appraisal system \nhas now been extended to include all staff.  There are improvements in the \nmanagement and analysis of data, although outcomes in key skills are yet to be \nanalysed at programme area level.  The corporation has received an analysis of \ncomplaints.  Peer observation continues, but lacks sufficient rigour to promote \nimprovements in teaching and learning in all areas.  The programme of on-site \nrefurbishment continues, and the computerised timetable helps teachers to make \nbetter use of accommodation.  Both the Business and Management and \nConstruction programme areas now provide good value for money. \n \nSummary of grades in reinspected programme areas \n \nProgramme area    Grade\nBusiness and  Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     2 \nManagement \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching,      2 \ntraining and assessment?  \nOverall grade      2 \n \n \nProgramme area    Grade\nConstruction Key question 1: How well do learners achieve?     2 \n \n Key question 2: How effective are teaching,     3 \ntraining and assessment?  \nOverall grade      3 \n \n5 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nThe quality of education and training in programme areas \nreinspected \n \n \nBusiness and Management  \n \nOverall Grade 2: Good features and no important shortcomings                         \n \nSummary of provision in Business and Management \n \n18 The Business and Management programme area has a wide range of courses and \nincludes specialist provision in management and business administration together \nwith retail and management services.  Within full-time courses there is an AVCE in \nbusiness and a First and National Diploma in public services.  Full-time level 3 \nlearners are able to combine their main course of study as part of the national pilot \nproject in the Welsh Baccalaureate.  There are no courses at entry or foundation \nlevel.  The college has improved its recruitment procedures for part-time provision to \nensure that learners are better matched to target qualifications.  Many part-time \nlearners are based in the workplace.  \n \nKey question 1: How well do learners achieve? \n \nGrade 2: Good features and no important shortcomings                                    \n \nSuccess in attaining agreed learning goals \n \n19 The standards achieved by learners have improved a great deal since the last \ninspection.  Most work is now of a good standard and learners��� files are generally \nwell presented.  In the best cases, learners analyse and solve problems well.  The \nmajority have a thorough understanding of vocational concepts.  Learners in AVCE \nbusiness, for example, can apply market segmentation analysis to identified products \neffectively.  Learners in Trade Union Studies apply their understanding of concepts in \ntheir daily responsibilities in work.   \n \n20 The rates at which students successfully complete qualifications in 2002-2003 have \nimproved a great deal overall since the last inspection and are now well above the \nsector average.  Unverified college data for 2003-2004 shows that successful \ncompletion in the majority of the main qualifications continues to be well above \nnational comparators.  Within this overall picture, in the last three years, outcomes in \nfull-time courses have shown a significant upward trend from a low initial starting \npoint.  Learners��� attainment on the main management qualifications has also \nimproved significantly since the last inspection.  Trade Union Studies courses have \nmaintained good level completion rates over the same period.  There is a steady \nimprovement in outcomes on financial programmes.  However, in a few of the retail \ncourses, the number of learners who do not complete their qualifications is still too \nhigh. \n6 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \n21 In 2002-2003, in the majority of cases, the overall college successful completion rate \nacross the three levels of the main key skills was well above the national comparator. \nHowever, the national comparators are low in all of these cases.  In Business and \nManagement, there is no attainment in the wider key skills for 2002-2003. \n \nProgress in learning \n \n22 The majority of learners work well, both in the workplace and college classes.  \nLearners apply themselves effectively in a wide range of tasks and activities.  In the \nbest cases, these help learners to develop thinking skills to a good level.  \n \n23 Learners on full-time courses develop confidence and oral skills through \npresentations such as those in the National Diploma in Public Services course, \nwhere learners carry out a presentation on accident prevention initiatives.  The \nmajority of work-based learners make good progress in completing their \nqualifications.  A few of these learners gain qualifications before the expected target \ndate.  \n \n24 Learners have a good understanding of assignment tasks and generally meet \ndeadlines when submitting work for assessment.  Close monitoring by tutors makes \nsure that learners are motivated to complete any outstanding work.  \n \nDevelopment of personal, social and learning skills \n \n25 Most work-based learners gather evidence of achievement effectively in a portfolio.  \nThese learners show good initiative and the ability to work independently.  In the best \ncases, college-based learners demonstrate good research and problem-solving \nskills.  \n \n26 Learners��� personal and social skills are developed well.  They are often involved in \nchallenging class discussions, such as those on issues in mental health.  These \ndiscussions also take place in tutorials.  However tutorials are not generally available \nfor part-time learners, and a few tutorials do not always make the best use of time to \npromote learning.  \n \n27 Full-time and work-based learners are involved in individual reviews of progress in \ntheir personal, social and learning skills.  These are effective and thorough and \nmonitor student progress across a wide range of learning experiences.  The \nadditional support needs of learners are identified and addressed appropriately.  A \nnewly introduced computerised system is helping staff to monitor the progress of \nwork-based learners closely.   \n \n28 Full-time learners follow a wide range of enrichment opportunities including the ILEX \nPara Legal Training, a residential course with the armed forces and guest speakers \nfrom industry and commerce.  Organised links with public services and local \nbusiness people provide most learners with good opportunities for work experience. \nAttendance is very good overall in the majority of sessions. \n7 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nKey question 2: How effective are teaching, training and assessment? \n \nGrade 2: Good features and no important shortcomings                                       \n \nTeaching \n \n29 The quality of teaching and work-based sessions has improved since the last \ninspection.  The majority of sessions observed are of good quality and often have \nchallenging learning goals.  In most sessions, objectives are explained clearly to \nlearners.   \n \n30 All teachers have good subject knowledge, which they use to extend learners' \nunderstanding effectively.  The majority of teachers use well-produced materials to \nsupport learning where appropriate.  \n \n31 The majority of college-based sessions have good pace and challenge for learners.   \nThey often include a range of well-planned teaching strategies.  These incorporate a \nvariety of interesting activities for learners.  However, in a minority of part-time \nclasses, learners have more limited opportunities to discuss their work with \ncolleagues.  Teaching is less effective on these occasions.   \n \n32 Most teachers use good questioning techniques to develop learners��� critical thinking \nskills.  Assessors use questions that are focused and challenge learners to extend \ntheir knowledge and understanding.  In the best cases, teachers and work-place \nassessors motivate learners to learn independently and develop their problem \nsolving skills.  However, in a few cases, teachers do not challenge learners��� ability to \nanalyse and evaluate enough.  Occasionally, teachers do not question the less \nconfident learners enough in order to improve their knowledge and understanding.  \n \n33 The programme area has recently revised its key skills strategy and now links a \nspecialist key skills tutor to every full-time course, in order to better integrate key \nskills into learners��� main programme of study.  It is too early to make a judgement on \nthe impact of this development on standards. \n \nAssessment \n \n34 The majority of learners��� work is of a good standard.  Most assessment requires \nlearners to carry out independent research and analysis related to current business \npractices.  In the majority of cases, feedback on assignments is detailed and \nconstructive.  However, in a few cases, learners do not get enough advice on how to \nimprove their work. \n \n35 Assessment plans for work-based learners are detailed and scheduled effectively to \nsupport progression towards qualifications.  These plans are often flexible enough to \naccommodate the pressure learners experience when working in a busy workplace \nsuch as a call centre.  Teachers schedule college-based assessments effectively so \nthat formative assessment is carried out early in the academic year. \n8 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nThe good features are: \n \n��� the good improvement in the rate at which learners gain qualifications;  \n \n��� the high levels of student attendance;  \n \n��� the challenge and variety of tasks and activities for learners within the majority  \n      of sessions;  \n \n��� the critical thinking and problem-solving skills of learners;  \n \n��� the effective monitoring of learners' progress;  \n \n��� the wide range of curriculum enrichment opportunities for full-time learners; and \n \n��� the planning of assessment within the workplace to meet learners and  \n      employers' needs. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n(1) continue the more effective approaches in key skills teaching to increase the      \nrate at which learners complete courses and attain qualifications; \n \n(2) share best practice in teaching across the programme area; and \n \n(3) ensure that tutorials for all learners support learning effectively. \n \n \nConstruction \n \nOverall Grade 3: Good features outweigh shortcomings                                    \n \nSummary of provision in construction \n \n36 The programme area offers courses in carpentry and joinery, plumbing, heating and \nventilation, brickwork, painting and decorating and gas approved code of practice. \nCourses are provided from entry level to level two in most cases.  New courses have \nbeen developed to meet the needs of learners in brickwork, plumbing and carpentry. \nThese are mainly at entry level and level 1.  There are appropriate progression \nopportunities on most courses.  A number of courses are available only in the \nevening to meet the needs of learners.  There are no courses available for technician \nqualifications. \n9 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nKey question 1: How well do learners achieve? \n \nGrade 2: Good features and no important shortcomings                                           \n \nSuccess in attaining agreed learning goals \n \n37 Most learners demonstrate good levels of knowledge, understanding and practical \nskills.  Learners in all occupational areas have a good understanding of concepts. \nTheory work is good in painting, decorating and brickwork, and satisfactory in \ncarpentry and joinery, plumbing, heating and ventilation. \n \n38 Learners��� portfolios and files follow a standard structure across the different \noccupational areas and are very well organised overall.  The work in the learners��� \nfolders is comprehensive and produced to a high standard.  \n \n39 The rates at which learners complete and attain qualifications have improved a great \ndeal since the last inspection.  Learners��� success rates in 2002-2003 are good on all \ncourses other than the Intermediate Construction Award where success rates in \n2003 were low.  However unverified college data shows a marked improvement in \nsuccess rates for this course in 2004.  College unverified data for most other courses \nin 2003-2004 confirms the overall trend of improvement.  Learners who are currently \nengaged on courses 2004-2005 are making good progress towards attaining their \nlearning goals. \n \n40 In 2002-2003, in the majority of cases, the overall college successful completion \nacross the three levels of the main key skills is well above the national comparator. \nHowever, the national comparators are low. \n \nProgress in learning \n \n41 Overall, students are making good progress in learning.  Many of the learners have \nfew previous qualifications.  Following the introduction of new Entry and Level 1 \ncourses, learners are now enrolled on more appropriate courses to suit their needs.  \n \n42 Progress in learning is measured by evaluating the progress of learners against an \nentry system that includes an interview with a tutor, and an aptitude test.  All learners \nagree learning targets with teachers; progress is closely monitored and reviewed on \na class basis.  Learners are now very aware of the progress they are making and \nwhat they need to do to complete their qualification.  Most learners are keen to \nprogress with their work and complete assessment tasks.  Learning support needs \nare quickly assessed and support is available to suit the needs of individuals.  \n \n43 A range of enrichment activities is provided.  These include additional qualifications \nin manual handling, first aid, and health and safety and prepare students well for \nemployment.  \n10 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nDevelopment of personal, social and learning skills \n \n44 Learners are well motivated in the majority of classes, and particularly so in practical \nsessions.  In a minority of cases the pace of theory lessons is slow with few \nopportunities for students to discuss work in groups.  Overall, there are good working \nrelationships between staff and learners.  Attendance is good throughout all \noccupational areas. \n \n45 Overall, students work well, both independently and in small groups, to develop their \nconfidence and learning skills.  In practical sessions, peer assessment is used to \ngood effect.  Learners��� develop a good understanding of the personal, social and \nlearning skills required for working within the construction industry. \n \nKey question 2: How effective are teaching, training and assessment? \n \nGrade 3: Good features outweigh shortcomings                                                   \n \nTeaching \n \n46 The quality of teaching is satisfactory overall.  Teachers have good subject \nknowledge and work to improve on their teaching skills.  More tutors are now \nworking to gain a teaching qualification.  Lesson plans continue to vary in quality; the \nbetter examples set clear learning objectives, note teacher and student activities and \ngive a notional timeframe for each of these.  In a minority of cases, lesson plans do \nnot provide sufficient detail.  They often do not provide enough detail on opportunities \nfor learners to develop further skills through research, evaluation and discussion. \n \n47 In most sessions, learners remain on task for a high proportion of the time, \ndeveloping their knowledge, understanding and competence.  In practical sessions, \nteachers provide learners with good opportunities to develop their skills.  In \nbrickwork, teachers ensure that learners develop skills in \"setting-out\" and in the \nmethods of constructing walls.  Courses in carpentry and joinery provide learners \nwith skills in basic jointing techniques.  The carpentry workshops have been  \n       re-decorated as part of a good teacher-led project in painting and decorating.  \nLearners in plumbing and heating and ventilation are taught how to bend copper pipe \nand solder joints to a good standard, which meets assessment criteria.  The teaching \nof key skills is good overall. \n \n48 In theory classes, teachers use learning aids well, for example handouts, visual aids \nand exemplar material.  Where appropriate, they present materials on whiteboards. \nHowever, in some theory sessions, teachers do not challenge learners enough.  In \nthese cases, there are not enough opportunities for them to research and evaluate \nand discuss their findings.  In these sessions, not enough activities are organised for \nlearners to make sure that they are well motivated throughout the session.  These \nweaknesses have not been identified enough through the process of classroom \npeer-observation. \n11 Quality and Standards in Post-16 Education and Training in Wales \nDeeside College Reinspection, October 2004 \n \nAssessment \n \n50 Assessment procedures within the provision meet the requirements of the awarding \nbodies.  The internal verification of assessments is good overall.  Teachers now \neffectively monitor the work of learners.  In most sessions, teachers regularly discuss \ntasks with individual learners during classes.  This aspect is especially good during \npractical sessions.  \n \n51 Assessment is well planned and scheduled to suit both the awarding body and meet \nthe needs of learners.  Most learners are aware of assessment procedures.  The \ntracking of assessment outcomes is good overall.  Staff regularly monitor the \ncompletion of learners' assignments.  Assessment tracking records are displayed on \nthe walls of work areas.  This is effective practice and provides a regular update of \nindividuals' progress towards the qualification for both teachers and learners.  \n \nThe good features are: \n \n��� the good subject knowledge of teachers; \n \n��� the quality of teaching in most practical sessions; \n \n��� the use of learning aids in successful sessions;  \n \n��� the improved assessment and monitoring of progress; and  \n \n��� the improved outcomes overall. \n \n Recommendations: \n \n(1) improve the quality of lesson plans; \n \n(2) provide more variety of learning tasks to make theory classes more challenging  \nand engaging for learners;  \n \n(3) ensure that all tutors have teaching qualifications; \n \n(4) improve the rigour of classroom peer-observation;  \n \n(5) extend opportunities for learners to develop further skills through research, \nevaluation and discussion; and \n \n(6) continue to sustain and improve on successful outcomes in all courses. \n12  \nAppendix 1 \n \n \nThe provider���s response to the report \n \nDeeside College welcomes the findings of the Estyn re-inspection of the business & \nManagement and Construction programme areas. \n \nThe governing body, principal and staff of Deeside College would like to thank the \nreporting inspector, programme area lead inspectors and visiting peer assessors for \nthe professional and supportive manner in which they conducted the re-inspection \nand provided constructive feedback. \n \nThe college is particularly pleased that the inspection team was able to confirm the \nexcellent progress that has been made in both programme areas and the overall \ngrades awarded matched those in its self-assessment report. \n \nThe report recognises that completion and attainment rates in both programme \nareas have improved significantly since the last inspection and that in most cases \nthey are now well above the national comparators. \n \nThe key improvement in Key Question 1 grades from grade 4 in May 2003 to grade 2 \nin October 2004 in both programme areas represents a significant achievement in a \nrelatively short timescale. This improvement owes much to the positive way in which \nmanagers and staff responded to the findings of the May 2003 inspection. The \nimprovement process was also assisted by open and constructive dialogue with the \nreporting inspector in the lead up to the re-inspection. \n \nAlthough Key Questions 3 to 7 were not subject to re-grading the report recognises \nthe significant distance travelled in relation to specific recommendations made in the \noriginal report. The comment that both programme areas now provide good value for \nmoney is particularly welcomed and confirms that good progress has been made in \nterms of both effectiveness and efficiency. \n \nThe college is determined to build further on the successful outcome of the re-\ninspection. Managers and staff have already begun acting on the report���s clear and \nhelpful recommendations for further improvement through increased sharing of good \npractice and a stronger focus on teaching and learning issues. \n \nThe report will undoubtedly assist the college in its future development across all \nareas of provision as it strives to achieve the highest standards in all areas of its \nwork. \n \n  \nAppendix 2 \n \n \nStatistical data provided by ELWa \n \nINSTITUTION   Deeside College         \n            \nDATE OF INSPECTION   18th October 2004         \n        \nEnrolments by IPA, Mode of Attendance and Year     \n        \n    Full Time Part Time \nInspection Programme Area \n  2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 \n                \nAccess Studies 32 41 40 74 68 38\nQ001  \nArt & Design 250 311 162 373 139 246\nQ02A \nApplied Science Q003  183 173 35 1509 1923 1999\nBusiness & Management Q004  356 82 199 2564 2560 2583\nCatering 103 69 123 542 1425 1622\nQ005  \nCaring & Health 746 466 878 2008 2697 1792\nQ006  \nComputing Q007  881 917 201 1570 2015 2489\nConstruction Q008  105 159 240 202 263 479\nEngineering 317 601 443 1035 1964 1824\nQ009  \nGeneral Education 355 460 409 213 241 200\nQ010  \nHairdressing & Beauty Q011  120 197 257 316 294 351\nSecretarial & Office Technology Q013  119 82 152 678 333 407\nTourism & Leisure 169 280 481 213 170 135\nQ014  \nCommunication Skills 0000  01 8\nQ015  \nIndependent Living Skills Q016  168 157 202 55 151 171\nABE / ESOL Q017  30 70 25 779 1366 1524\nWelsh for Adults 60 1 2 165 345 224\nQ18A \nOther General Education 2699 3338 3155 2905 4623 4783\nQ18B \nNon Schedule 2 Q019  11 15 20 1380 1412 988\nX X              \nTotal total 67047419702416581 2198921873\n \n  \n \nEnrolments by IPA, Age group and Year      \n        \n    Under 19 19 and Over \nInspection Programme Area \n  2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 \n                \nAccess Studies Q001  0 0 0 106 109 78\nArt & Design Q02A 166 204 116 457 246 292\nApplied Science Q003  329 340 240 1363 1756 1794\nBusiness & Management 543 340 332 2377 2302 2450\nQ004  \nCatering Q005  106 109 166 539 1385 1579\nCaring & Health Q006  602 466 644 2152 2697 2026\nComputing Q007  742 972 251 1709 1960 2439\nConstruction 147 213 319 160 209 400\nQ008  \nEngineering Q009  544 921 838 808 1644 1429\nGeneral Education Q010  302 416 383 266 285 226\nHairdressing & Beauty Q011  133 199 284 303 292 324\nSecretarial & Office Technology 77 140 130 720 275 429\nQ013  \nTourism & Leisure Q014  193 239 453 189 211 163\nCommunication Skills Q015  0 0 0 0 0 18\nIndependent Living Skills Q016  113 119 234 110 189 139\nABE / ESOL 40 101 74 769 1335 1475\nQ017  \nWelsh for Adults Q18A 26 8 0 199 338 226\nOther General Education Q18B 2084 2988 3234 3520 4973 4704\nNon Schedule 2 Q019  55 24 37 1336 1403 971\nX X              \nTotal total 6202 7799 7735 17083 21609 21162\n \n  \n \nEnrolments by IPA, Gender and Year      \n        \nInspection   Male Female \nProgramme Area   2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 \n                \nAccess Studies Q001  15 13 8 91 96 70\nArt & Design Q02A 239 232 189 384 218 219\nApplied Science Q003  816 875 893 876 1221 1141\nBusiness & Management 977 839 1012 1943 1802 1770\nQ004  \nCatering Q005  292 597 782 353 897 963\nCaring & Health Q006  775 1544 856 1979 1619 1814\nComputing Q007  1294 1772 1444 1157 1160 1246\nConstruction 298 409 710 9 13 9\nQ008  \nEngineering Q009  1312 2435 2173 40 130 94\nGeneral Education Q010  166 288 242 402 413 367\nHairdressing & Beauty Q011  33 28 27 403 463 581\nSecretarial & Office Technology 140 66 67 657 349 492\nQ013  \nTourism & Leisure Q014  119 129 319 263 321 297\nCommunication Skills Q015  0 0 12 0 0 6\nIndependent Living Skills Q016  109 157 237 114 151 136\nABE / ESOL 245 476 479 564 960 1070\nQ017  \nWelsh for Adults Q18A 64 160 91 161 186 135\nOther General Education Q18B 2535 3327 4331 3069 4634 3607\nNon Schedule 2 Q019  817 727 580 574 700 428\nX X              \nTotal total 10246 14074 14452 13039 15333 14445\n \n  \nINSTITUTION   Deeside College           \n              \nDATE OF INSPECTION   18th October 2004           \n          \n     \nCompletion Rates by IPA, Mode of Attendance and Year \n          \n    Full Time Part Time \nNat.

The cost can be broken down as follows;\n\n\tFour Assembly Members and three officials undertook visits to Deeside and Flintshire requiring an overnight stay on 18 October 2007 at a cost of £567.\n\tFour Assembly Members and three officials visited the Dyslexia Unit at the University of Bangor requiring an overnight stay on 17 January 2008 at a cost of £504.\n\tA room was booked for a meeting in Mold on 19 October 2007 at a cost of £24.\n\tAs part of other work undertaken by the Enterprise and Learning Committee, three Assembly Members and two officials stayed an additional night in Boston, Massachusetts, to take evidence on the Support for People with Dyslexia inquiry at a total cost of £600.\n\tA video conference with parents and children in North Wales and a meeting with parents and children in Cardiff each cost £30.\n\tThe report was printed by the Assembly print unit at a cost of £1.44 per copy. Three hundred reports were printed at a total cost of £432.\n\n\nSecretarial support was provided by officials working in the Committee Service team as part of their wider role and consequently the cost cannot be identified. \n\nYour request has been considered according to the principles set out in the Code of Practice on Public Access to Information. The code is published on our website at http://www.assemblywales.org/abthome/abt-foi/abt-foi-cop-pub.htm.  If you prefer, I can send you a printed copy.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this response please contact me.\n\nIf you believe that I have not applied the Code correctly or have not followed the relevant laws, you may make a formal complaint to the Chief Executive and Clerk at the National Assembly for Wales, Cardiff Bay.  Details of the Assembly’s complaints principles are set out in the Code of Practice on Complaints available on the Internet at http://www.assemblywales.org/conhome/con-complaint.htm or by post. \n\nIf you are not content with the outcome of the internal review, you have the right to apply directly to the Information Commissioner for a decision.

Mr Robertson asked:\n\n“Is now not the right time to debate extending the powers of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh National Assembly?  It might give the Leader of the House the opportunity to expand on his damning indictment of the Scottish Executive.  Perhaps he could give the House an inkling into whether he thinks that this is entirely the fault of the Scottish Labour Party, or whether he also blames their coalition partner colleagues the Liberal Democrats?”\n\nThe first part of Mr Hain’s reply was:\n\n“This is another bit of nationalist spin, joined by the Scottish Press and the broadcasting authorities, who’ve completely misrepresented, as I’m afraid all too often they do, what goes on in the Scottish Executive and the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland.”\n\nMr Robertson said:\n\n“Peter Hain lashing out at the Scottish Media is yet another blunder from this gaffe-prone Minister.\n\n“He cancelled a press conference on his latest remarks, no doubt under pressure from Number 10 – just as he was forced to change his speech on the top rate of income tax last year.\n\n“Peter Hain is fast becoming the new ‘Alan Clark figure’ of the House of Commons!”\n\n\n    \n\n\n                        \n\n    \t\n       \n\n      \n      \n      \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  User login\n    \n\n Login / Membership no. : *\n \n\n\n\n Password: *\n \n\n\n\n\tCreate new account\n\tRequest new password\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      \n\n \n\n\n      \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  My Tools\n    \n\tBlogs\n\tCreate content\n\tNews aggregator\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n       \n\n    \n\t\n    \n      \n      \tHome\n\tAbout\n\tYouth\n\tStudent\n\tTUG\n\tAccessibility\n\tContact\n\tDisclaimer\n\tIT Compliance\n\tPrivacy Statement\n\tJob Vacancies\n\tSite map\n\n      \n\n          \n\n    \n      Promoted by Peter Murrell on behalf of the Scottish National Party, both at Gordon Lamb House, 3 Jackson's Entry, Edinburgh, EH8 8PJ    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

The challenge was set and during the week 10-17 March 2008, one mother in Bury St Edmunds gave it a go. She only threw out a plaster.  Can you do it too?  Why not try your own Rubbish Diet and slim your bin. You'll be amazed at how easy it really is and   you could even save some money.  If Almost Mrs Average can do it, you can too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages\n\n\n\tHOME\n\tABOUT\n\tTHE RUBBISH DIET CHALLENGE\n\tCAN YOU RECYCLE IT?\n\tLATEST NEWS\n\tRUBBISH TWEETERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, 9 April 2008\n\n\n\n\nWaste Not Want Not\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone is playing lingo bingo on this site, you can at last tick off the good old \"Waste Not Want Not.\"  After avoiding the clichÃ© for the last two and a half months, I'm afraid I couldn't hold off any longer.\n\nI haven't been able to forget Oliver Heath's point about the importance of seeing our waste as a resource and making the connection between what we throw away and what it could become.\n\nUp until now my impetus for recycling has been driven by guilt, the guilt of having too much rubbish to deal with, the guilt of sending so much stuff to landfill and the impact of my actions on the environment.  That's a lot for people to handle and pretty much falls into the negative \"cup half empty\" culture.\n\nHowever, thinking about rubbish as a resource, in the way that Oliver Heath describes, captures a much brighter and more positive image.   It's more upbeat, uplifting and encouraging.   In fact, what he describes is covered by a term that I've not heard before, which is Upcycling.\n\nUpcycling was first coined by William Mcdonough and Michael Braungart in their book Cradle to Cradle, Remaking the way we make things.  It's all about taking something that is disposable and making it into something that has greater value.  Thanks to regular commenter Mel for bringing the book to my attention.   Some of the great upcycled products she's spotted are fleece jackets made out of pop bottles & carrier bags, pencils made out of vending-machine plastic cups and  waste-paper bins made out of woven newspaper.\n\nI hadn't realised how many upcycled products are available or indeed the variety.  Just having a poke about the Internet revealed the breadth of items from school uniforms  made from plastic bottles, right through to a range of shoes made from seat belts, car seat leather and recycled rubber.\n\nAnd as for our old f(r)iend, the plastic bag,  I've also discovered a jewellery designer who makes a beautiful range of necklaces and earrings from old carrier bags.  Also don't close down the Internet tonight without visiting the Re-toyed Trash Project, which has encouraged me to get out the needle and thread and be inventive.\n\nIf you've now caught the upcycled bug and are looking for even more creative inspiration have a look at the following sites, which reveal the wonderful array of products that are available.\n\nEcoCentric is the online shop which was co-founded by Oliver Heath and includes eco and ethically-friendly products.  My favourite is the Recycled Cardboard Castle.  I suppose that comes from being a mother of boys.\n\nI can also recommend the recycling section on the Hippyshopper website/blog, which features a whole range of inspirational products.  It is really worth a good-old browse.  You'll even discover jewellery made from recycled flip-flops.\n\nIt is also encouraging to see that there are now alternatives to all those corporate promotional products that litter desk drawers, kitchen cupboards and eventually landfill.  If you work in an office you'll know the kind of thing I mean.  How many coasters and keyrings does the world actually need?  At least, companies like Allwag are now offering alternative products made from recycled resources including  tyres, plastic bags, juice cartons and circuit boards.\n\nThere are even products out there for pets, as demonstrated by the dog toys made from plastic bottles, available from the online store Stop and Paws.\n\nSo I think it's a big thumbs up for upcycling in the 21st Century.  I now think about recycling in a new light and I hope you do too.

In our centenary year what can we do that we are not already doing? please Rob get them to support existing charities that need maintaining in this climate of economic depression and fear.  stop putting \"white wash\" over the problems of society, we really need to get back to basics---- how to sew buttons on and polish our shoes and have a pride in our charitable organisations that have stood the test of time without the government restricting or pushing us into \"new\" ideas, ideals and a whole new language of VCS and CG and constituent giving.....\n\n \n\n\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Page 1 of 1\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tPrevious\n\n\t \t\tNext\t \t\n\n\n\n\n\t  Forum  Discussions  Real Times  'You just don't understand us!'\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n                                        \t\n\t\t\n\t \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n                            \n\n                            \n                                HomeÂ Â Â |Â Â Â About  Â Â Â |Â Â Â ResearchÂ Â Â |Â Â Â Capacity buildingÂ Â Â |Â Â Â PublicationsÂ Â Â |Â Â Â NewsÂ Â Â |Â Â Â ContactÂ Â Â |Â Â Â InvolvementÂ Â Â |Â Â Â LinksÂ Â Â |Â Â Â Blog\n \n\n                        \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n\n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Privacy Statement  |  Terms Of Use \n\n                        \n                            Copyright 2009 by TSRC\n \n\n                        \n                        \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\n\n\n\n",

I built a site for a client in 2005 and only in the past couple of months has getty sent my client a letter stating that they owe £1700. I downloaded the images and paid for then on  istockphoto and there was no paper trail. \n\nMy client has received another letter, and I really don't know what to do next. I have taken the images off her site. But like I said they came from Istock. The thing is I have searched through all my archives and I can't find the originals. Plus they don't seem to be on istock anymore.\n\nPerhaps someone trying to make money initially put the photos on istock and then unwitting people like me downloaded them, perhaps istock found out they were illegal and took them off...but theres no way of find it out. I contacted Istocks copyright dept but I am not holding out much hope.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\n\n\nEdited by dave stallon - 05 Dec 2009 at 9:20am\n   \n\n   \n   \n  \n\t\n\t\n   \n   \n   BOBC \n   \n    Members Profile\n\n    Send Private Message\n\n    Find Members Posts\n\n    Add to Buddy List\n \n   \n\n   \nFSB Member\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\nJoined: 14 Sep 2009\n      \nOnline Status: Offline\n   \nPosts: 333\n   \n  \t\n   \n       Quote  Reply\n   \n    Posted: 05 Dec 2009 at 11:59am\n\t\n   \n   \n   \n   Why was there no paper trail?

I would bet they wouldn't and then you can send a further notice demanding that they cease all correspondance with you or you will be sending them a bill for your time spent dealing with the matter.  Of course I'm by no means any kind of legal advisor and I suggest you decide for yourself a course of action, that's just how I might deal with it if I were in that situation.\n   \n\n   \n   \n  \n\t\n   \n    \n     North Staffs Branch - Member\n\nComputer Technology Ltd\n\ncomputer technology forum\n    \n\n   \n  \n\t\n\t\n   \n   \n   reputationman \n   \n    Members Profile\n\n    Send Private Message\n\n    Find Members Posts\n\n    Visit Members Homepage\n\n    Add to Buddy List\n \n   \n\n   \nFSB Member\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\nJoined: 07 Dec 2009\n      \nOnline Status: Offline\n   \nPosts: 30\n   \n  \t\n   \n       Quote  Reply\n   \n    Posted: 08 Dec 2009 at 9:32am\n\t\n   \n   \n   \n   It's not a matter of of copyright that is the issue its the amount they want to charge and how they deal with people who do want to come to an agreement.  In my case I requested an image from a hotel website, they said that was fine to use it, so we used it on a clients website.  It was not until 2 years later getty said we had taken it without permission.  We contacted the hotel and they also were being chased by getty as someone had taken a photo of their hotel and their web designer had got it from somewhere.  The point being we had absolutely no reason to think the hotel did not own it and how would we know they didn't?  Getty's attitude was terrible they did not care even though we removed the image straight away.  They wanted £1200 for a thumb nail.  That's the real crime!!! Copyright totally agree Getty approach and attitude is absolutely terrible.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n   \n  \n\t\n   \n    \n     Need help with your reputation online?  www.reputationmanagementfor.com/\n    \n\n   \n  \n\t\n\t\n   \n   \n   trader1 \n   \n    Members Profile\n\n    Send Private Message\n\n    Find Members Posts\n\n    Add to Buddy List\n \n   \n\n   \nNewbie\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\nJoined: 22 Oct 2007\n   \nLocation: United Kingdom\n      \nOnline Status: Offline\n   \nPosts: 137\n   \n  \t\n   \n       Quote  Reply\n   \n    Posted: 09 Dec 2009 at 8:05am\n\t\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\tOriginally posted by Nemisis\n\nBobC\nPerhaps you would be good enough to explain to everyone exactly what the site you refer to is and at the same time explain fully why only one company appears to have been taken to court over this matter out of what would appear to well over 10,000 threatening letters.\n\nI too think copyright violation is theft but there are more colours of grey than your black and white account appears to give credit for. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes I would like to see a reply to these questions as the moment anyone speaks out challenging BobC etc you tend to get shot down and accused of repeating the 'same old thing' and being accused of not understanding anything from the links he produces.\n\n \n\nAfter seeing where one of the links BobC offered goes, detailing a supposed interview with someone from the only company, seemingly taken to court by Getty, its not surprising we are somewhat suspicious of motives etc.\n\n \n\nFinally the point BobC makes reference 'Getty have 6 years' is I have been advised a little disengenious. My current understanding is that the case that did go to court all happened very quickly from initial letter to notification of court hearing. Apparently the longer Getty and Co leave between the initial letter and proceeding the more difficult it is for them. \n\n \n\nIt will certainly be interesting to see if any more cases come to light during 2010 and certainly any that date back.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n  \n\t\n\t\n   \n   \n   BOBC \n   \n    Members Profile\n\n    Send Private Message\n\n    Find Members Posts\n\n    Add to Buddy List\n \n   \n\n   \nFSB Member\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\nJoined: 14 Sep 2009\n      \nOnline Status: Offline\n   \nPosts: 333\n   \n  \t\n   \n       Quote  Reply\n   \n    Posted: 09 Dec 2009 at 8:11am\n\t\n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n\tOriginally posted by Nemisis\n\nBobC\nPerhaps you would be good enough to explain to everyone exactly what the site you refer to is and at the same time explain fully why only one company appears to have been taken to court over this matter out of what would appear to well over 10,000 threatening letters.\n\nI too think copyright violation is theft but there are more colours of grey than your black and white account appears to give credit for. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have lived away from the action for over 30 years but asking around I have come across several photographers who have been approached by Getty to 'join' in legal action.

What you appear to be saying is that Getty have sent out thousands of demand letters without having permission or authorisation from the owner / photographer and only when asked for proof and or Getty want to proceed, do Getty appear then try to entice the owner /photographer to join them in creating a legal case.\n \n\nAlso you quote 17 in the UK? 17 what?

It isn't a case that Getty do not have permission, it is that photographers have pushed Getty into taking action on their behalf. Only when they go the next step do Getty need the photographers' permission to put their name on the court action papers. \n\nThe 17 I mentioned are the 3 already mentioned in an earlier thread plus 14 I have heard about via photographers. \n\nIf you have forgotten the earlier history of this the original report which spurred Getty and Corbis into action is here.......\n\nhttp://www.stockartistsalliance.org/infringements\n\n   \n\n   \n   \n  \n\t\n\t\n   \n   \n   BOBC \n   \n    Members Profile\n\n    Send Private Message\n\n    Find Members Posts\n\n    Add to Buddy List\n \n   \n\n   \nFSB Member\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\nJoined: 14 Sep 2009\n      \nOnline Status: Offline\n   \nPosts: 333\n   \n  \t\n   \n       Quote  Reply\n   \n    Posted: 09 Dec 2009 at 8:39pm\n\t\n   \n   \n   \n   \nIf you really want to know how misleading, dangerous and downright costly the sticky thread was please read the link I gave.

Mr Kenny said at the Fine Gael president's dinner on Saturday night that a unanimous vote by the Dáil would offer any political endorsement necessary.\n\nAttorney General Rory Brady has already offered legal advice to a Cabinet meeting held also on Tuesday in Dublin on whether the proposals require a change to the Constitution, given the people's past acceptance of the Belfast Agreement.\n\nMeanwhile Labour leader Pat Rabbitte said the outcome of the Scottish talks was \"somewhat disappointing\" given the expectations raised by both governments in advance.\n\n\"It is essential that whatever form of 'electoral endorsement' is now sought should not lead to further strengthening of the political extremes at the expense of the more moderate parties who have done so much to bring about an end to violence to bring Northern Ireland to the position where it is today.\"\n\nTuesday wasl the first time Dr Paisley and Mr Adams have had such intimate direct political contact. The DUP’s delegation comprised of Dr Paisley, deputy leader Peter Robinson and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds. Mr Adams was joined by prospective Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and one other senior party member.\n\nThe programme for government committee has been meeting throughout the summer and while early meetings were often acrimonious, in the latter summer months there was business-like engagement and both governments are delighted that the historic meeting marked the beginning of similar contact between Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams.\n\nThere is unanimous agreement between the parties that the opportunity to extract a financial package to support the agreement from London, Dublin and Washington and Brussels should be exploited. \"This is the time to exert maximum leverage, not later, and we are talking about a package of billions, not millions, over a period of time,\" a senior DUP source told me at the weekend.\n\nSinn Féin and the DUP must say by November 10th whether they accept the proposals. Mr Adams and Mr Robinson said their parties have immediately embarked on a consultation process with their politicians, party members and supporters.\n\nMr Robinson, rounding on Ulster Unionist Party leader Sir Reg Empey who categorised the St Andrews paper as the \"Belfast Agreement for slow learners\", indicated that the DUP continued to be generally comfortable with the Scottish proposals. \"This agreement is immeasurably better than the lousy deal negotiated by the UUP in 1998,\" he said.\n\nMr Adams told a republican rally in Belfast on Sunday aftternoon that republicans must be prepared for DUP politicians attempting to sell the agreement as a victory for the DUP. Republicans must be \"more mature\" than that.\n\n\"Bringing rejectionist unionism into the peace process would be an enormous achievement,\" he said. \"Our endeavour is to make peace with Ian Paisley and those he represents because we are avowedly anti-sectarian.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\tRelated links\n\n\n\n\t\n\t· More about Politics\n\n· News by IIB TEAM\n\n\n\nMost-read story in Politics:\n\nUlster Crisis - Best Blogs And Intelligent Commentary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\nContact Us ::  List Your Site :: Contribute Your Own Articles :: \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n \nYou can syndicate our news using the XML / RSS file backend.php\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "Cranmer: 40 days and 40 nights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  Sunday, March 28, 2010\n\n  \n\n  \n     \n  \n  \n         \n    \n\t \n\t 40 days and 40 nights\n\t \n    \n\n    \n\n\t         \n\t\n      \nDavid Cameron told Conservative activists yesterday that they had 40 days and 40 nights to convince the electorate that Labour is not the future and that only he offered the change necessary to heal broken Britain. He said: \"The economy's stuck, society's stuck, the whole country is stuck with Gordon Brown. And we need that change, that energy, that dynamism, to get our economy moving, to get our country moving, to get our society moving.\"\n\nThe biblical allusion prompted Tom Harris MP to tweet: \n\nOdd that Dave's using Biblical language. When I hear \"40 days and 40 nights\" the first thing I think is \"wilderness\".\nAnd that, Mr Harris, is right and good.\n\nFor these 13 years have been a period of soul-searching and introspection every bit as painful as the other two great periods in the wilderness that the Conservative Party has endured. Its longest period in opposition (1850-74) came as a result of the schism caused by the repeal of the Corn Laws. Since the Party lost power in 1997, Disraeli?s darkest days have been re-lived by John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. They were typified by a lack of unity, fractious in-fighting, disloyalty and a resigned despondency that the party never actually deserved to win against Tony Blair: indeed, there were many on the Conservative benches who preferred Mr Blair to Major, Hague, Duncan Smith or Howard.\n\nBut then New Labour removed their most successful leader in the party?s history, and foisted Gordon Brown upon the nation. And week after week he had to face the youthful David Cameron across the despatch box, with Mr Cameron exuding a passion for change, tenacity, vigour and suave presentation. In just a few short years since he was elected, David Cameron has managed to draw together the disparate and sometimes conflicting strands of the Conservative Party, and has succeeded in reconstituting it as the ?broad church? consonant with its history.\n\nOn this Palm Sunday, let us remember that periods in the wilderness are invariably sorely testing, but they can be profoundly purgatorial. Yet the catharsis is only beneficial if it is enduring, if the lessons are learned and effect real change.\n\nIn the Lord?s case, the wilderness was a necessary prelude to the incarnational kenosis: he conquered the temptations of the Devil and demonstrated that He came to free people from Satan?s power.\n \nIn Disraeli?s case, his wilderness years were inseparable from the great Tory revival, his ?One Nation? legacy and the birth of the modern Conservative Party.\n\nIn Cameron?s case, the fruits of his wilderness years are yet to be tasted. But there is sure and certain hope of resurrection.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      posted by Archbishop Cranmer at 9:42 AM Permalink\n        \n    \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n\n\t\n        22 Comments:\n\n        \t\n         Jared Gaites said...\n      \n\t\n\n        \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\", but all we have is in fact emptiness.  Maybe a little taste or indication of what to expect could actually put some zest into the public's enthusiasm.  At this moment all we hear about is 'cuts in the orchard'.  Not exactly inspiring stuff is it, hardly the sort of platform to launch a revival.  Even His Grace's poetic use of language can barely touch the imagination.

And he clearly has not that fortitude.  \n\nWe can't do a thing while we're ruled by foreigners for foreigners.\n\nElection?  The whole thing's a charade and a travesty.  It has to be either the BNP or UKIP - or the army.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 11:22\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Anabaptist said...\n      \n\t\n\n        Mr Wheeler, you should vote for the candidate who most closely represents your views. \n\nPolitical choices are always compromises, and political parties are always coalitions. You will hardly ever find a candidate or a party that suits you completely (unless you stand yourself).\n\nIf you are going to vote, you have to decide which of your aspirations, beliefs and principles you are going to shelve, and which take priority.\n\nAs I consider that EU membership is the most important political issue of our time, and that withdrawal is the sine qua non of restoring our national fortunes, I shall be voting for one of the only viable parties offering me that policy.\n\nI therefore have a choice between UKIP and BNP. The latter is mired in a heritage of hatred and irrational prejudice, and brings other matters to the table that violate my libertarian beliefs.\n\nI am therefore left with UKIP, which I shall support despite its perceived seediness and the eccentricity of some of its leaders.\n\nThat's my compromise. I am certainly not going to try 'tactical voting' as that is simply guesswork. In any case, the ballot paper doesn't offer us the opportunity of voting against -- only of voting for.\n\nThe alternative would be abstention.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 11:22\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Anonymous said...\n      \n\t\n\n        From David Lonsdale\n\nDavid Cameron talks of being radical when he gets into power. We do need a radical change of direction,but I have heard nothing from Mr Cameron that is remotely radical.\n   Radical change to address our now deep seated problems cannot be effected whilst we are in the EU, about which he said nothing at the Conservative's Spring Conference. He talks of re-patriating powers from Brussels, yet that is not possible without treaty change and Angela Merkel has just told him that the EU will not be re-visiting any treaties. 'In Europe but not run by Europe' is a nonsensical mantra. If we are in the EU we are subject to EU laws and nothing that Mr Cameron says will change that.\n    If Mr Cameron loses this election it will be because of the EU; the fault line that runs down the middle of the party. As long as we remain in the EU the Conservatives cannot win an election. Their only hope is to make the case for withdrawal and garner the UKIP vote.\n    What the people want to hear is that he has a robust policy on immigration along the lines proposed by UKIP. That is a halt to immigration unless a foreign national has a work permit. Once the situation had stabilised the rule could be relaxed.\n    He said he was going to get rid of the Human Rights Act. He has gone quiet on that in the last few months, yet such a move would be hugely popular and eminently sensible. However, he would also have to renounce the European Convention on Human Rights as administered by the European Court and that would bring him into conflict with his masters in Brussels.\n    Positive discrimination is an iniquitous doctrine that denies merit. The people who believe in positive discrimination would never vote Conservative anyway, so why destroy your core vote to appeal to the radical left-wing fringe.\n   Given the gerrymandering of the electoral process by the Labour Party in terms of constituency boundaries, the influx of Labour voting immigrants and government employees, Mr Cameron will have a difficult enough job as it is. Spitting in the face of his core vote is not the way to win the coming election.\n    There is one other glaring issue, which David Wheeler has mentioned. Whichever party we vote for we will get a Godless leadership. Mr Cameron may go to church, but his embrace of the gospel message appears very superficial. Clegg is an avowed atheist and Brown is a Marxist. God, ultimately, will decide this election and an unbelieving and rebellious nation will get the government they deserve.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 11:24\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         British Shorthair said...\n      \n\t\n\n        Kenosis.

Not on the Lisbon Treaty but on the question of IN or OUT.  And he needs to dump that suicidal anti CO2, anti efficient energy policiy.  Until Camoron sees sense, or the common sense conservatives take control, my vote goes to UKIP.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 14:11\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Johnny Rottenborough said...\n      \n\t\n\n        In Cameron?s case, the fruits of his wilderness years are yet to be tasted. But there is sure and certain hope of resurrection.\n\nIf Your Grace is referring to a resurrection of traditional Conservatism, I doubt if Cameron is the man to do it. Mind you, I?m only judging by what he says:\n\n?I don?t want us to leave the EU because I don?t think it?s sensible and I don?t think it?s the right thing for Britain.??David Cameron\n\n?Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around.??David Cameron\n\n?We would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands. I?m in favour of immigration, we?ve benefited from immigration.??David Cameron\n\n?and by what others say about him:\n\n?He?s a PR guy. He behaves as if he doesn?t believe in anything other than?the right public image.??Rupert Murdoch\n\n?My doubts about his commitment to doing anything effective were increased this week when I was told that he had got 70 Conservative MPs together and told them the EU issue did not matter.??Stuart Wheeler\n\n?and by his probity:\n\nDavid Cameron faced an internal inquiry yesterday into claims he ?maxed out? his second home expenses. The Tory leader took out a £350,000 taxpayer-funded mortgage and then paid off a £75,000 loan soon afterwards. The financial juggling may have cost taxpayers as much as £22,000.?Daily Record\n\n?and by his competence:\n\nDavid Cameron losing the plot in Gay Times interview.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 14:11\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Anonymous said...\n      \n\t\n\n        Cameron has 40 days and 40 nights, eh? Could someone remind me just how long this slime ball has been 'leader' of the Conservative Party? I was thinking he had been leader of Her Majesty's Opposition for nigh on 5 years. But maybe I was wrong. \n\nBut if I'm right, pray tell what Cameron has done in the last 1,785 days and nights to oppose the most disgusting bunch of charlatans to run this country since the Rotten Parliament some 400 years ago.\n\nCameron? A complete waste of space, I fear.\n\n      \n\t28 March 2010 14:20\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         British Shorthair said...\n      \n\t\n\n        Anabaptist:\n\nThe very same.

His ratings have steadily fallen since then and it looks like it will be a Hung Parliament. \n\nIf so, approximately 12 months of nothing will happen, aside from the utter collapse of the economy and probably law and order (what's left of it) with it, followed the removal of Cameron in favour of David Davis, who will split the Tories straight down the middle. UKIP and BNP will become real contenders.\n\nMy advise would be to leave the UK.

The truth is often extremely illusive but not in the slightest bit subjective.\n\nWith out the full unadulterated truth, opinion is often completely wrong and in many cases dangerously so. Worse, in a democracy not knowing the full known facts of the matter has the potential to endanger your material being as well as your eternal soul.\n\nFor just one example\n\nWe were not told the full facts regarding 9/11 or the two current wars in the middle east. However we are now personally responsible for needlessly and violently murdering possibly as many as hundreds of thousands of perfectly innocent human beings.\n\nEven if it were only one, it would be one too many.\n\nSelf defence is the only possible excuse for killing another human being. Even then a poor one. \n\nIt is now clear that we were not acting in self defence, neither were we attacked by wholly outside forces. 9/11 was in the main a false flag operation performed in conspiracy with compliant elements working within the Islamic world.\n\nThere is no point hiding from this reality, however bad our own economic situation may be, or seem to be. We can not hind from the all seeing eye of our own minds or consciousness. \n\nWe are now eternally condemned by our own inaction and procrastination. Wholly set up for a cruel but highly deserved soon to be coming retribution.\n\nIgnorance often seems and often is relative bliss. \n\nHowever the children of god should understand that salvation can only be found or sort in a far better place then on this murderously nasty planet. \n\nIn the better place ignorance will not be any type of excuse, especially if your ignorance was simply caused by sloth, wishful thinking, or having more pressing things to concern your self with at the time.\n\nBe careful my friends, after all do you really want to be sent back here again for yet another go at getting it right?\n\n      \n\t29 March 2010 03:58\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         len said...\n      \n\t\n\n        And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for Him.\n?Hebrews 9:27-28\n\n( There is no second chance!)\n\n      \n\t29 March 2010 08:21\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         ENGLISHMAN said...\n      \n\t\n\n        We are not looking for fourty days and nights ,what we seek are six hundred and fifty crucifictions and a new begining,a parliament of honest men if any are still to be found and a system of administration, of, for and by the indigenous peoples of these islands,not marxist lunatics,bilderburg toffs,liberaly demented,or the third world plague that thinks it knows just how to run a modern first world country,yet is incapable of performing this feat on its own soil.\n\n      \n\t29 March 2010 08:53\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Atlas shrugged said...\n      \n\t\n\n        He said: \"They point the way towards a society dominated by majoritarianism and not a more tolerant view of society.\" \n\nI have heard democracy called many very bad things, many of which I said myself. However I have never heard it called majoritarianism.\n\nIf only it were so. For it is clear that if the majority will ruled we would be living in a far more liberal society then we do today. IMO racism would have become a thing of the distant past, the word sexism would never have been invented, and neither would homophobia.\n\nThe majority of British people are by nature liberal as well as fundamentally libertarian in there thinking. They are conservative to preserve all that is good, and radical to destroy all that is evil. Which IMO is as it should be, and could have been. \n\nHowever we can never know for sure, because we were deliberately divided so that the establishment can carry on ruling over us a very long time ago.\n\nThis is now called Identity Politics. When it was young it was known as state sponsored RACISM and/or DISCRIMINATION. \n\nNot a pretty sight at the best of times, as well as cruel, illogical, illiberal, undemocratic, authoritarian, highly suspect, infinitely corruptible, when not also being deliberately counter-productive.\n\n      \n\t30 March 2010 01:54\n\t   \n\t  \n\t\n         Atlas shrugged said...\n      \n\t\n\n        To expand on my point.\n\nDemocracy at its best is performed using clear and free debate and carrots rather then sticks.\n\nIdentity Politics as well as Political correctness represent neither of these things. this especially when the full force of the law gets in anyway involved in to situation. At this point democracy has not only failed it has stopped trying to win.\n\nOr put more accurately deliberately being shown to be no longer relevant or respected as the proper manner by which a democratic society MUST be run.\n\nWe have far more serious racial problems in the UK today then any time during the fifties and sixties. Shown to be so by even the governments own dubious statistics and the more factual rise and rise of The BNP.\n\n      \n\t30 March 2010 02:08\n\t   \n\t  \n\n\n\t\t\n\n    Post a Comment\n    \n\n    \t    \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t<< Home\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nAbout Cranmer:\n\nArchbishop Cranmer takes as his inspiration the words of Sir Humphrey Appleby: ?It?s interesting,? he observes, ?that nowadays politicians want to talk about moral issues, and bishops want to talk politics.?  It is the fusion of the two in public life, and the necessity for a wider understanding of their complex symbiosis, which leads His Grace to write on these very sensitive issues. Things got just a little bit too hot on 21st March 1556. His Grace hasn't been around much since, but he is as keen as ever to investigate and expose religio-politics or politico-religiosity, so email Cranmer with your insights, and he shall investigate - whatever the cost...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCranmer's debt:\n\n\n\n\nCranmer's collection plate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA certain wrong needs to be righted: a gross injustice and an offence against all that is right, noble and true needs to be challenged, and the costs are acutely material as well as profoundly emotional. His Grace is not being sued and is the subject of no lawsuit against him: he has done no wrong, committed no crime, and neither is any alleged. And yet he suffers immense detriment. Any donations would be gratefully received in order that His Grace's ashes might not be irrevocably scattered to the four winds. And if that is too cryptic, please consider a token of appreciation to support His Grace's august blog of intelligent and erudite comment upon matters religio-political. Bless you.  \n\n\nReligious faith will be of the same significance to the 21st century as political ideology was to the 20th century. In an era of globalisation, there is nothing more important than getting people of different faiths and cultures to understand each other better and live in peace and mutual respect, and to give faith itself its proper place in the future.\n\n\nThe Rt.

It has only the Catholic Faith of the ancient Catholic Church, as preserved in the Catholic Creeds and maintained in the Catholic and Apostolic constitution of Christ's Church from the beginning.\n\n\nDr Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1945-1961\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish Conservatism's greatest:\n\nThe epithet of 'great' can be applied only to those who were defining leaders who successfully articulated and embodied the Conservatism of their age. They combined in their personal styles, priorities and policies, as Edmund Burke would say, 'a disposition to preserve' with an 'ability to improve'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am in politics because of the conflict between good and evil, and I believe that in the end good will triumph.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher LG, OM, PC, FRS.\n(Prime Minister 1979-1990)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have not overthrown the divine right of kings to fall down for the divine right of experts.\n\nHarold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton, OM, PC.\n(Prime Minister 1957-1963)\n\n\n\n\n\nSocialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.\n\nSir Winston Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, FRS, PC (Can).\n(Prime Minister 1940-1945, 1951-1955)\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not struck so much by the diversity of testimony as by the many-sidedness of truth.\n\nStanley Baldwin, 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley, KG, PC.\n(Prime Minister 1923-1924, 1924-1929, 1935-1937)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe the doctors, nothing is wholesome; if you believe the theologians, nothing is innocent; if you believe the military, nothing is safe.\n\nRobert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, KG, GCVO, PC.\n(Prime Minister 1885-1886, 1886-1892, 1895-1902)\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a Conservative to preserve all that is good in our constitution, a Radical to remove all that is bad. I seek to preserve property and to respect order, and I equally decry the appeal to the passions of the many or the prejudices of the few.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli KG, PC, FRS, Earl of Beaconsfield.\n(Prime Minister 1868, 1874-1880)\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic opinion is a compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy, and newspaper paragraphs.\n\nSir Robert Peel, Bt.\n(Prime Minister 1834-1835, 1841-1846)\n\n\n\n\n\nI consider the right of election as a public trust, granted not for the benefit of the individual, but for the public good.\n\nRobert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool.\n(Prime Minister 1812-1827)\n\n\n\n\n\nNecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.\n\nThe Rt Hon.

But surely its own example questions the logic of trying to wipe out this gamekeeper turned poacher, says Clive James.\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tPeople who despair for the future of life on Earth should take heart from the capacity of living creatures to adapt when threatened. In the last few days there has been news about an inspiring instance of this capacity. Once again the focus of international media interest is on my homeland, Australia. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tI speak of the cane toad. The size of a cheap handbag and covered in warts, the cane toad can be found in many parts of Australia. Indeed the cane toad can be found in so many parts of Australia that experts predict there will be soon no part of Australia in which at least one cane toad, or more likely several thousand cane toads, cannot be found. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t                            \n\t\t\t                    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIn such a climate of glory, even a cane toad looked good.

We are invited to worry about this, but I prefer to be encouraged, and to worry just that little bit less about Iranian atomic bombs, North Korean multi-stage rockets, and the imminent immersion of the inhabited world under a rising ocean dotted with the charred corpses of polar bears. Earthly life-forms are tough, and the career of the cane toad shows just how tough they can be. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tYou probably know most of the cane toad story already because my country of origin, in order to ensure that its high standard of living should not be threatened by a population of excessive size, has a kind of anti-tourist board dedicated to making Australia look less attractive than it might be in the eyes of the world. After World War II, the anti-tourist board spread stories through overseas outlets about Australia's teeming range of poisonous spiders and snakes. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tThere were stories of the red-back spider that hides under the toilet seat to avoid publicity, and the taipan snake that was so poisonous it could kill a man on a horse after killing the horse, and would do both these things unprovoked, because it liked publicity. The anti-tourist board was scarcely obliged to exaggerate. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAnti-tourist board\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tAustralian spiders and snakes are really like that. So you're a prospective migrant and you're afraid of getting bitten a little bit? What are you, a man or a mouse? If you're a mouse, you've got no business going near a taipan anyway.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAustralia the movie: 150,000 cattle... oh, and Nicole Kidman\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMore recently, the anti-tourist board positioned its enormous influence behind a film called Australia, which was plainly designed to put immigrants off going to Australia by presenting, at enormous length, a prospect of a country where nothing happened except a 150,000 cattle moving slowly across the parched landscape, each beast pausing for an individual close-up at any moment when the director thought the pace was too hectic. But the most reliable weapon in the armoury of the Australian anti-tourist board has always been the story of the cane toad. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tScarcely believable on the face of it âand the face of it is the face of the cane toad, which is scarcely believable in itself - the story is true in every respect. The first few of the unprepossessing creatures were imported into Queensland in 1935 because it was thought that they would help protect the sugar-cane crop by eating the grey-back cane beetle, a pest. So the cane toads were doing pest control. The thought that the creature imported to do pest control might itself become a pest had not yet occurred to anybody. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tNineteen-thirty-five was a big year for Australia because Mutiny on the Bounty, with Clark Gable and Charles Laughton, was the top box office movie in the world and therefore the attention of the entire planet was on the South Pacific, a circumstance which always tends to turn the collective head of the Australian media. In such a climate of glory, even a cane toad looked good. Not as good as Clark Gable, perhaps, but at least as good as Charles Laughton. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tFinger lickin' bad\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tAlas, it soon became apparent that the cane toad was less interested in eating the grey-back cane beetle than in eating everything else whether living or dead and, most disastrously, in being eaten itself, with stunning results for whatever ate it, because the cane toad was poisonous. Its body is composed largely of poison glands which produce a narcotic that is currently classified officially in Australia as a Class One drug along with heroin and marijuana. Toad licking, we are told, can result in death.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRugby's Scott Quinnell gets snared into some anti-tourist board work\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLucky I was told that soon enough, or I might have tried it as the next step up from the hash cookie. But inevitably, this classification as a drug in Class One induces some people to try it out. The results of ingesting the toxin, however, are seldom good for humans and they can be lethal for almost any other creature, up to and including crocodiles. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tThese facts were found out quite soon after the cane toad was introduced. These facts were found out by the same experts who had thought that the cane toad would be good for pest control. But by the time it was discovered that the cane toad was a lot better at being a pest itself, the cane toad had revealed its other characteristic, a fantastic ability to increase in numbers. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tBy now, as I speak, there are more than three hundred million of them and their number has increased significantly since the start of this sentence. And as their numbers increase, they travel, because there simply wouldn't be room for all the cane toads if they stayed in one place. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tThey didn't even stay in Queensland for long, and by now they have moved a long way west. You have only to see a close-up of even one of these creatures to know what it would mean for vast tracts of the country to be covered with them even if they were harmless and tasted like hamburger. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tSuper rabbits\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tA creature with few successful predators ranged against it - and most creatures who want to eat the cane toad die on the spot a few minutes after they try to -- usually won't be kept down just because human beings like the taste of it. The first big pest problem introduced into Australia was the rabbit, which, back in the 19th Century, was brought in to provide country gentlemen with good hunting. In short order there were untold millions of them. \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t    \n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t                    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe performance of the cane toad suggests that even if they all turn into gay males and start collecting Judy Garland records they will go on taking territory at the rate of 15 miles a year\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t            \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRabbits made good eating but they were eaten only by the poor. When we ate rabbit in our house while I was growing up I was encouraged not to mention it in case we were looked down on. But even if everybody in the country had eaten rabbit three times a day it wouldn't have made a dent in the rabbit population, which went on increasing until a specifically anti-rabbit disease called myxomatosis was let loose \n\n\n\t\n\n\tAfter an initial reduction in the rabbit population, the long term effect was the emergence of a super rabbit. Those of us who remember that fact will be suspicious of those plans, first mooted in 2006, to introduce a genetic switch in the cane toad that will turn them all into males and therefore extinguish the cane toad population. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tThe performance of the cane toad so far suggests that even if they all turn into gay males and start collecting Judy Garland records they will go on taking territory at the rate of 15 miles a year, which more or less means that there will soon be enough of them in Canberra to demand voting rights. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tToad armies\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tThe news last week was that there are new plans to unleash a predator against the cane toad, the meat ant. Confidence in the meat ant is high. Whereas frogs and other kinds of toad will flee at the mere sight of a meat ant, we are told, the cane toad will just sit there cooperatively waiting to be attacked and killed. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tBut there are two things wrong with that story. One thing wrong is that that's exactly what the grey-back cane beetle was supposed to do when the cane toad showed up, and the other is, what if it works and the meat ant becomes the new unstoppable success? Much wiser to concentrate on those voting rights. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBehold, the bigger, longer cane toad, which has evolved in living memory\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf the cane toad can survive so much, then it can evolve, and the signs are that it's already doing so. The evidence was buried in last week's report, but I underlined it and I've got it here in front of me. This is the bit you probably haven't heard yet, but I think it might be crucial. As the advance guard of the cane toad army moves west, its leading members are developing longer and stronger legs. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tHave you got that? The cane toads are getting bigger and smarter. Soon they'll be learning to drive. There is a school of thought, not necessarily paranoid, which holds the opinion that cane toads with human skills have already penetrated the Australian media and are even appearing as presenters of reality television shows. That might be a fear too far, but surely it makes sense to start thinking of how the cane toads can be dealt with in another way than warfare. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tIt's time to negotiate. We need to find out what their demands are. What do they want? One thing they might want is aid. You have to believe me when I say that the same scientists who have measured the longer and stronger legs of the vanguard toads have also diagnosed arthritis. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tLimping toads, wincing with pain as they advance. Common humanity demands that we should make an antidote available. I say it's time to sit down with their leaders and discuss matters of mutual benefit. If they can evolve that fast, maybe they'll turn into a better version of us. Maybe they already have. Maybe some of them have got on planes to spread the cane toad message to the world. \n\n\n\t\n\n\tBut no, take it easy. I'm just croaking. I mean I'm just joking. Croak, croak, croak, croak.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tBelow is a selection of your comments.\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tI went to school in North Queensland, about three kms up the road from the Sugar Research station where they let them go. It was one of my primary school's teachers grandfather who was the man who lifted the proverbial trap and released them all... and the funny thing is that we did this because they were doing it in Hawaii at the time and it appeared to work! Well there happened to be a climatic effect but our American cousins didn't work that out till years later. Luckily for them their island is a lot smaller than our one and they could remove them over a period of time. Interestingly though the local wildlife appears to be adapting to the new menace. I have seen the large toads like i did as a child. There are stories going round of birds learning to flip them over to expose the stomachs (and not the poison glands) and snakes developing immunity to the toxin.. isn't nature wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tTom, OZ\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tSo far, the cane toads haven't reached Clive's old home suburb of Kogarah, but why not try to export this whole \"criminal class\" of cane toads much as Britain tried to rid itself of its criminal classes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Penal colonies of toads could be set up, for example, on that Scottish island that was used in WWII for anthrax experiments; or how about in London NW1 or wherever it is that Clive hangs his chapeau? \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tMartin Pooley, Marrikville, Australia\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tThis is definitely the funniest influential writer I have ever read on the BBC news, which I've read daily for many years.

They haven't reached Vic yet, but are all over Queensland and the NT when I was up there. This does make me think though - was the arch-enemy from Dangermouse a stark gaze into the future? Scary.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tRichard, Melbourne, Australia\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tThis article is to funny... impossible to find this kind of humour in the French press. I will send it to my daughter who just arrived in Sydney and will live there for four years, she should learn the toad language right away!\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tMarc Wuyts, Tronget, France\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tThis story was great. I was thoroughly entertained, especially as I will be visiting Australia in 2 months time. I will most probably encounter these toads on my visit, and I will be sure to think back to this article, especially the part about toad licking resulting in death.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tMary Catherine, Maple Glen, Pennsylvania, USA\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tWow this article tried to fluff itself up with so much wordsmithing the entire points of it are lost. I think it had some good points about evolution in pest control (which is why it is rarely called extermination anymore) but trying to specifically dig them out is like going through a root canal.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tJacob Kinnun, Tucson, AZ\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tThat article made me laugh till I croaked - I mean choked, so perhaps the cane toad is a threat to human survival after all.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tMarion Monahan, Bristol\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tHaving learned of Cane Toads several years ago from a movie by the same name, I have been following their growing notoriety in the press. The toads have finally found in the author of the article a worthy and noble proponent of their cause. Their rapid expansion, toxic composition and insatiable quest for filling every corner of their environment is reminiscent of the species chronicling their ascendance. Perhaps in one regard, the toads exceed the accomplishments of homo sapiens. No record exists of toads making war on each other, except for the occasional accidental case of toad self ingestion. Perhaps we could learn from them, or perhaps they've learned from our mistakes and will soon establish a superior and less self destructive civilization on the remnants of our own. We dominated for 10,000 years. That was yesterday. This is Toad Day.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tRoland Schnippering, Exeter, NH, US\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n                         \nBookmark with:\n \n\t \nDelicious \n\n\t \nDigg \n\n\t \nreddit \n\n\t

          "DUP.org.uk\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t \t\n\t \t Diane Dodds  MEP\n\t\n\t\tMEP welcomes author of Key European Agriculture report to N.I. \nDUP MEP Diane Dodds has welcomed Scottish MEP George Lyon to Northern Ireland to meet a series of politicians, industry representatives and farmers to discuss the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Mr Lyon will author a key European Parliament report on the CAP, which plays a pivotal role in the sustainability of farming in Northern Ireland.  Commenting, Diane Dodds said: \n\n\n\"To have George in Northern Ireland, meeting a broad representation of the agriculture sector, has given our local industry an opportunity to input into a key European Parliament report that will form a negotiating position on the reform of the CAP. In his role as author of this report, George has already visited France and Germany to ascertain their position on CAP reform. To have him here in Northern Ireland is a unique opportunity, for a relatively small area, to help mould this report. \n\nThe Common Agricultural Policy is key to the sustainability of our agriculture sector in Northern Ireland. Many farmers are heavily reliant on their Single Farm Payment to maintain their livelihood. As these payments come from the CAP budget, the message being delivered to George, as he sets about authoring this report, is that the CAP budget ought to be protected and that direct payments to farmers must remain. \n\nThe input from the local industry and the interest shown has been very encouraging and George is leaving in no doubt that Northern Ireland desires a strong CAP that supports our agriculture industry. This has been a worthwhile visit, but represents only the beginning of the fight to maintain the CAP at current levels. As we look to the reform post 2013, the fight will continue in the European Parliament, and with the Commission. It is a fight that must be won, and in which we must continue to make sure the needs of Northern Ireland are known and met.\"\n\n\n\t \t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\t     ALL CONTENT © DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY 2009\n\n\n\n",

from the end of July the video podcasts will no longer be produced. We are now looking at how the trial went and what we can learn from it, and will decide what happens next later in the year.

'Youth-bulge' theory refers to the large proportion of the world's population under 27 years old who are supposedly prone to violence. Images of angry young men of colour as potential terrorists and veiled young women as victims of repressive regimes support the theory. The implied threat of explosive violence and explosive fertility provides a rationale for US military intervention and population control initiatives in other countries and justifies government surveillance of Muslims and Arabs within US borders.\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n                34.

This paper offers evidence that international environmentalist practices interact with local and national conditions to advance the structural work of ethnic discrimination and racism in Southeast Asia. The racist outcomes of these practices do not flow exclusively from unprofessionalism, faulty science, irrationality, immorality or incorrect beliefs -- and anti-racist strategy has to accommodate this insight. \n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n                \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n      \n  \n                Internal Conflict\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n                Adaptation and Reaction to Globalisation\n  \n\n  \n  \n                Mark Duffield\n  \n\n  \n  \n                31 January 1999\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n                12.

But it is worrying to see that criminals are now targeting shopkeepers to sell illegal goods,\" he said.\n\n\n\tThe group claimed one in five of its members surveyed had been offered contraband and/or counterfeit tobacco to sell in their shops.\n\n\n\tKathleen O'Meara, head of advocacy with the Irish Cancer Society, said the claim that sales were down 40pc was extraordinary.\n\n\n\t\"There is no link between point-of-sale regulation and smuggling and smoking,\" she said.\n\n\n\tProfessor Luke Clancy, ASH Ireland, also disputed the retailers' figures.\n\n\n\t\"Do they have evidence of the smuggling?\" he asked. \"They should put their money there to try and reduce smuggling.\"\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSource: Herald.ie -

and the smoking ban is already beginning to pay dividends.\n\n\n\tA report in the British Medical Journal shows there was a 2.4 per cent drop in the number of emergency heart attack admissions to hospital in the first 12 months of the ban.\n\n\n\tAnother, by the London Health Observatory, shows that smoke-free legislation has resulted in around 9,600 fewer bed days for heart attacks at an estimated cost saving of ��8.4 million in acute hospital care.\n\n\n\tThe primary aim of the smoking ban was to protect workers and the general public from exposure to the harmful effects of second hand smoke.\n\n\n\tCoun Mike Biggin, the borough council's executive member for climate change and public protection said: \"Since the Smokefree Law came into force three years ago, environmental health officers in Warrington have carried out more than 3,000 inspections of workplaces and public places across the borough and the compliance rates for not smoking in a smokefree place remains consistently high at 99%.\"��\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSource: Warrington Worldwide -

Consistent with previous published studies of the economic impact of smoking bans, this analysis did not find significant economic effects on the hospitality industry as a whole.\n\n\n\tIn both Minneapolis and St. Paul, the policies were associated with an increase of at least 3 percent in employment at restaurants over a 2 ��-year span following adoption of a local clean indoor air policy. Employment in Minneapolis bars increased more than 5 percent after passage of that city's smoking ban, while in St. Paul, bar employment had a nonsignificant decrease of 1 percent - a decrease that cannot be statistically distinguished from zero, or no change in employment.\n\n\n\tThe researchers noted that the broad look at total bar and restaurant employment at the city level over time means that this study is not able to describe potential changes at the neighborhood or individual business level. Opponents to smoking bans have argued against enactment of these policies with predictions of large revenue losses, worker layoffs and business closures in the hospitality industry, and at bars in particular because of known correlations between drinking and tobacco use.\n\n\n\tProponents of such policies say smoking bans promote a healthful workplace atmosphere for workers and patrons. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, exposure to secondhand smoke increases nonsmokers' risks of developing lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory conditions and other diseases.\n\n\n\t\"These clean indoor air policies are designed to protect workers from exposure to secondhand smoke,\" said Elizabeth Klein, assistant professor of health behavior and health promotion at Ohio State University and lead author of the study.\n\n\n\t\"We are evaluating business employment because employment is an objective measure of the overall economic health of these businesses. What we have found is that there isn't a significant economic effect for bars, and in fact for restaurants, there is some positive change in employment. These findings underscore that nothing economically catastrophic happened for bars or restaurants in the Twin Cities as a result of banning smoking in these environments.\"\n\n\n\tThe research is published in the July/August issue of the Journal of Public Health Management Practice.\n\n\n\tAll of this research examines employment trends before Minnesota adopted a comprehensive statewide clean indoor air policy in late 2007. A comprehensive citywide smoking ban - covering virtually all workplaces - took effect on March 31, 2005 in Minneapolis and on March 31, 2006 in St. Paul. For a year before that, St. Paul operated under a partial smoking ban that exempted bars.\n\n\n\t\"It is difficult to find an appropriate comparison between one city with a clean indoor air policy and another city without a policy, so we used this model to look at what was going on in each community before adoption of the policies and what happened after that. This design allows for each city to serve as its own comparison group,\" Klein said.\n\n\n\tThe researchers also accounted for employment in the rest of the hospitality industry - minus restaurants and bars - over the same time period as a way to account for general economic conditions that might have been an additional influence on bar and restaurant employment.\n\n\n\tThe researchers obtained employment figures from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, to which businesses are required by law to report the total number of individuals they employ each month.\n\n\n\tIn Minneapolis, the comprehensive smoking ban was associated with a 3 percent gradual permanent increase in employment at restaurants and an increase of between 5 percent and 6 percent employment in bars. The estimated change in the rest of the hospitality industry, when compared with either bars or restaurants, was a 1 percent or smaller increase in employment.\n\n\n\tIn St. Paul, the clean indoor air policy was associated with a 4 percent increase in restaurant employment. Bars, which were not subject to the smoking ban until a year later than restaurants in that city, saw a 1 percent or smaller decrease in employment after the smoking ban took effect in bars. When subject to statistical analysis, that decrease was no different from no effect at all.\n\n\n\tFor the rest of the hospitality industry in St. Paul, the partial smoking ban was associated with an almost 12 percent increase in employment. The comprehensive clean indoor air policy adopted a year later was associated with a reduction in hospitality employment of 13 percent, but this decrease was not significant by statistical standards. Klein said no clear explanation exists for this decrease, but an ongoing investigation into the economic effects of the statewide Minnesota smoking ban adopted in late 2007 can evaluate if other regions of the state experienced similar trends.\n\n\n\tAs part of monitoring other economic conditions, Klein accounted for the potential influence of a National Hockey League 2004-05 season-long strike on employment at bars and restaurants in St. Paul, home to the Minnesota Wild. The strike was associated with a nonsignificant drop in bar and restaurant employment of less than 1 percent.\n\n\n\tThe researchers did note that the employment figures act as a headcount of the total number of people employed but do not differentiate between part-time and full-time jobs held. And while revenues are another strong indicator of the economic health of businesses, reliable revenue data would not be available frequently enough to allow for a monthly analysis.\n\n\n\tKlein said that these findings are consistent with previous research that has examined the economic effects of smoking bans on bars and restaurants in California and in cities in Canada and Australia. It also reinforces her own findings published in 2009 that suggested that exempting bars from community smoking bans made no economic difference in terms of preserving bar employment. That study examined employment trends over three years in eight Minnesota cities with different types of clean indoor air policies and two cities with no laws restricting smoking.\n\n\n\tWhile the Midwestern United States has been slower to adopt clean indoor air policies than have coastal states, Klein said this first detailed look at the economic effects of smoking bans on bars in the Midwest might encourage more communities and states in the region to consider adopting the policies.\n\n\n\t\"These results show there is a null or a slightly positive effect on employment with these policies,\" Klein said. \"In this case, it appears that the unintended consequences of local clean indoor air policies may have had a positive, albeit small, economic benefit for hospitality businesses.\"\n\n\n\tThis work was supported by a grant from ClearWay Minnesota, an independent, nonprofit organization seeking to reduce Minnesota residents' tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke through research, action and collaboration. The study findings do not necessarily represent the official views of the organization. ��\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSource: MediLexicon - 01 July 2010\nLink: http://bit.ly/cBQVov\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\thome\n\t\n\t\tabout\n\t\n\t\tpolicies\n\t\n\t\tinformation\n\t\n\t\tstopping\n\t\n\t\tmedia\n\t\n\t\tshop\n\t\n\t\tsite map\n\t\n\t\tterms of use\n\t\n\t\tprivacy\n\t\n\t\taccessiblity\n\n\n\n\tLimited Company No: 998971 |��Registered Charity No. 262067\n\n\n\tThis website has been archived for the UK Web Archive by the Wellcome Library.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

First the good news - the numbers affected by HIV/AIDS in the UK are going down after a number of years when the UK had one of the highest rates of infection in the EU. But the disease continues to rage in Africa and Eastern Europe in particular and many of those affected still do not have recourse to treatment because of the non-availability of cheap generic drugs and medical care.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I want to be particularly personal now about this illness and how it is affecting many people who have been living with HIV for many years here in the UK. Tonight I am meeting a friend who is a gay man who has been living with the virus for 24 years. He has been very ill in the past and thanks to a support network of organisations such as the Positive Place in South London (where I was a trustee from 1998 to 2001) and which tragically closed down recently, he has managed to keep going. He is in receipt of DLA (Disability Living Allowance) and suffered scarring of his brain as a result of the illness. \n\n\n\n\n\nOver a year ago the DWP in its wisdom decided to review the cases of hundreds of people who were HIV+ and who had been given 6 months to live in the 90s when the disease was untreatable. Many of these people had lost everything - homes, life insurance policies, jobs etc when they were ill and their only lifeline was DLA. They also suffered incredible psychological stress believing that they were going to die. The new drugs only came online in the mid 90s and it was uncertain for several years as to how effective they would be. Many of them had terrible side effects - hallucinations, paranoia, incontinence, dizziness etc and many patients were forced to change drug regimes many times.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuddenly last year the DWP decided to review all of these people's cases - some were in their 60s and 70s. Many had their DLA reduced or removed. On what basis was this done? HIV is not curable and many of these people had no other income. Are they able to return to work with variable states of health and having been out of the labour market for years. None of this was of concern to the bureaucrats of the DWP and many have been plunged into poverty, including my friend. The latest development is that he is being called to an interview by his local council (Lewisham) about his Freedom Pass, which allows him some measure of mobility in using public transport. The reason, of course, is that because his DLA has been reduced this has given the green light to the Council money savers to try and remove his pass as well. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo for many of these people living long term with HIV and with all of the former social networks gone (work, HIV support groups etc) they are expected to disappear from the scene, to be housebound and to live in penury. This is their reward for having lived beyond their 'sell by date' and for struggling for years against illness and depression. It is not surprising that some of the survivors I have known have committed suicide or had breakdowns. This caring sharing country regards them as being excess to requirments and a burden on the system. Not much different really to what the survivors of World War 1 discovered when they returned to a country which they had bene promised would be \"a land fit for heroes\". What they found instead was poverty, disabiliy and neglect. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo when today the gliterati and celebrities at some of the large organisations and elsewhere are marking World Aids Day, spare a thought for the long term survivors here who have been through all of it, seen friends and lovers die and are now just an afterthought. For them World Aids Day leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. We should remember them and campaign to give them better treatment that what many of them are currently receiving at the hands of local and national government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nJoseph\n\n\nat\nTuesday, December 01, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \nMonday, 30 November 2009\n\n\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\nClimate Scepticism and Liars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the unbelievable news over the weekend that Nick Griffin of the BNP who spoke out against climate change last week in the European Parliament is being sent to the Copenhagen Summit as a representative of the EU - the meeting below is very timely. Fresh from claiming that the BNP are the defenders of the planet they are now the vanguard of a new movement challenging the orthodoxies of climate change. Well hardly surprising that someone who once denied the holocaust now denies climate change will lead to the extinction of thousands of species and the possible deaths of many millions of people in a world ravaged by drought and famine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDEX ON CENSORSHIP EVENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFREE SPEECH & COPENHAGEN SUMMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Saying the unsayable: is climate scepticism the new Holocaust denial?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Dec, 6.30 - 8pm, Free Word Centre, 60 Farringdon Road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSVP to: bookings@freewordonline.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Copenhagen Summit will debate one of the most important public issues of \n\n\n\nthe past thirty years.

This begs the question: is there a special responsibility \n\n\n\nfor the media to exercise restraint in reporting climate change?

It was a well attended conference and there was a wide range of unions represented (including someone from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions) and a number of pensioner groups and former trade unionists.\n\n\n\nThe first speaker, Professor Keith Ewing, an expert on employment law, posed the question to the conference on why the vast amounts of funding being paid into the Labour Party by the trade union movement was not leading to any improvement in the situation concerning employment and labour law in the UK. He suggested that instead of subsidising Labour, the primary aim of the trade union movement should be to pay for legal challenges in the courts concerning employment law and that money remaining should go to the Labour Party. His point is a very valid one, as John Hendy QC, also an expert on labour law, compared trade union rights in the UK to those of Russia and Turkey and unlike anywhere else in the EU. He outlined one recent industrial dispute where a strike involving workers at Metrobus was ruled illegal because the ballot was held on a Friday and the information sent back to the trade union officials at 5pm, which is when they had left work. The ballot result was sent over the national union HQ on the Monday morning and then registered in accordance with the employment law and returned to the local union officials, and the employer was given the result on the Tuesday morning. This resulted in no material loss to the employer, yet the courts ruled that the union had acted contrary to the employment laws of the UK. \n\n\n\nIt was quite clear from the conference that British trade unions are working under a handicap which does not apply to workers and unions in the rest of the EU. Indeed there was strong evidence from the discussions that the main drive against workers rights is coming from the British government and not the EU and that within the EU, it is the UK which is pushing for faster and deeper implementation of laws detrimental to trade union rights. Another speaker was John Monks from the ETUC (European TUC) who argued that he was glad that a French commissioner had been appointed as Commissioner with responsibility for financial dealings as he would be much more prepared to use regulatory controls than a UK one. John Monks also called on the TUC and the UK unions to support a European workers action day in March, to ensure that workers across the EU were not called upon to pay the price for the greed and rapaciousness of bankers and the financial institutions.\n\n\n\nThe conundrum of how to work with a British Labour government which has done nothing to weaken Thatcher's anti-union laws and attempted to privatise the Royal Mail, was addressed by Billy Hayes, the General Secretary of the CWU (Communication Workers Union). Hayes argued that it was only by working with allies within the Labour Party that the privatisation of Royal Mail had been prevented and quoted Tariq Ali saying: \"The only difference between the Tories and Labour is 5%. But it is within that 5% that we must operate.\" Hayes also went on to compare the situation with postal services in other EU states and gave the example that the UK system is so open to privatisation that the Irish Post Office (An Post) can bid for contracts in Northern Ireland by paying a fee of £1,000 whereas the Royal Mail cannot bid for the postal services in any other EU state, including the Irish Republic. Hayes also pointed to France, where Sarkozy had just given considerable subsidies to the nationalised postal service, stating that the privatisiation of the French postal service would not be in the French national interest. For Hayes it was clear who was responsible - the Labour government. Yet his union is one of their biggest sponsors! Many in the audience pointed out that it is only electoral calculations which have prevented Mandelson from privatising the Royal Mail this time and that if New Labour are returned they will try again, as indeed will the Tories.\n\n\n\nKeith Ewing had pointed out that it was only necessary for the UK government to register services as being protected by national pay and conditions clauses and it would have the impact of making all employment in those services 'protected' . This would not mean protectionism but that all EU workers working in that field in the UK or working for subcontractors based in another EU state, would have to be paid under the same terms and conditions as workers in the UK. This had already been done by many other EU states. Again, it was a failure of political will on the part of the Labour government which meant that this had not been done. So in the \"race to the bottom\" and the removal of workers rights and terms and conditions, it is not the EU which is primarily responsible, but the Labour government of the UK which wants its economic space to be the most deregulated in Europe as before it boasted that its financial services were also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a grim lesson here for the British trade unions, which so far has only been learnt by the RMT, PCS, and one or two others. You are paying your oppressors. Even Billy Hayes had to admit that the conditions of neither of the two Warwick Agreements with the trade unions have been met - one of those conditions in Wawick 1 was a commitment to a state run Royal Mail - this government has tried to end that. The Green Party is committed to trade union rights and national control of public services and would implement many of the rights which UK workers are losing rapidly under the excuse that it is the EU which is implementing this. Time for trade unionists to wake up before the general election and to smell the coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nJoseph\n\n\nat\nMonday, November 30, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \nFriday, 27 November 2009\n\n\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\nBenefits and Rights for workers and disabled people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisability benefits and the cost of social care have been in the news a lot recently with the consultation on the Social Care Green Paper etc and the threat to remove Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance for those over 65. However, it is worth bearing in mind that the concept of the European Union is supposedly to support the free movement of labour and of peoples. This seems not to be happening when it comes to disabled people. Many benefits and pensions are portable, i.e. they can be taken and used in other countries of the EU when the person goes there to live or work. This applies to DLA. However, it would seem that the DWP does not like this nor does it like the fact that the European Court of Justice ruled that DLA claimants whose benefits were removed by the DWP are trying to have them restored. So it has set up a tribunal which is taking ages to hear cases and is also trying to wriggle out of reasons for restoring the benefits. The excellent Green MEP, Caroline Lucas, has written to the Minister to complain about this miscarriage of justice and the letter below is on her website. Just another example of how Greens are fighting for workers rights and the rights of disabled people also.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.carolinelucasmep.org.uk/2009/11/27/correspondence-about-workers-rights/\n\n\n\nTomorrow I am attending a conference organised by the Institute of Employemnt Rights about how EU law is impacting on workers rights. This is a huge subject area and many of the recent European Court of Justice rulings are affecting this. The conference at the TUC, Congress House in London will be addressed by a number of leading employment law academics and trade unionists. It is vitally important that as trade unionists and as citizens we engage fully and are knowledgeable about what is happening in the EU, both in terms of rights being extended by the European courts and in terms of limitations being placed on those rights as workers and citizens. The recent court rulings in these cases could lead to \"a drive to the bottom\" and remove whole elements of bargaining rights and protection for UK workers. Greens are opposed to this and stand fully behind the European trade union movement and its call for stronge rights for workers and against social dumping.\n\n\n\nEuropean Court of Justice cases:\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping a strategy for trade unionists\n\n\n\n\n\nA full-day conference\n\n\n\n\n\nSATURDAY 28th NOVEMBER\n\n\n\n\n\nTUC Congress House, Great Russell Street,\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon WC1B 3LS\n\n\n\nOrganised by The Institute of Employment Rights inassociation with SERTUC.\n\n\n\nConfirmed speakers include: Prof Keith Ewing, John Hendy\n\n\n\nQC, John Monks (ETUC).

He was returning from a tour of Norway where he was speaking about the wall which Israel has built along the West Bank to divide the Palestinian and Israeli communities. Mohammed was told: “his human rights work would not be helpful as he is now in the hands of the State of Israel”. This is chilling. Mohammed is a campaigner with the organisation \"Stop the Wall Campaign.\" Details below from the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Observatory has been informed by reliable sources about the ongoing arbitrary detention of Mr. Mohammad Othman, a volunteer with the “Palestinian Grassroots Stop the Wall Campaign”[1], who remains held in administrative detention since September 22, 2009, without charges or being able to know the reason for his arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\n\n\nAccording to the information received, the next hearing in Mr. Mohammad Othman’s case will take place on Sunday November 8, 2009.\n\n\n\nIt is feared that Mr. Othman be placed under indefinite administrative detention, without charge or trial, for a renewable period of one to six months[2]. Another hearing will also take place on the same day on the fact that Mr. Othman is not allowed any more to see his lawyer since his recent transfer to Beersheva prison, where he is no longer detained in solitary confinement.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, 2009, Mr. Mohammad Othman was arrested at the Allenby Bridge border crossing between Jordan and the West Bank as he was on his way back to Ramallah from an advocacy tour in Norway, during which he was engaged in a number of speaking events and meetings with Government officials.\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2009, Mr. Othman was transferred from Huwwara provisional detention centre to Kishon (Jalameh) interrogation centre, located near Haifa in northern Israel. He was subsequently placed in solitary confinement.\n\n\n\nOn September 27, 2009, Mr. Othman was interrogated for the first time. During the interrogation session, he was questioned about his friends and family and was asked to provide their telephone numbers along with his personal e-mail address. In addition, the interrogators asked him broad questions about his work.\n\n\n\nOn September 29, 2009, the Military Court at Kishon interrogation centre extended Mr. Mohammad Othman’s detention period for ten days. On October 8, 2009, the Salem Military Court, in the northern West Bank, prolonged his detention for a further twelve days[3]. During neither of the two court hearings, the Israeli interrogation police did provide any charges against Mr. Othman, but contended that an extension of his detention period was necessary for further interrogation. The first time the military judge rejected the interrogators’ initial request to extend Mr. Othman’s detention period to twenty-three additional days, arguing that no clear allegations exist as only two short interrogation sessions had taken place during the previous eight days of his detention. The judge did agree, however, to a ten day extension period, based on “secret information” that was made available to him by representatives from the Israeli Security Agency (ISA). At the court hearing in Kishon, Mr. Othman’s lawyer questioned the ISA officers about the content of the undisclosed information and the reasons for Mohammad’s detention, but received no answer.\n\n\n\nOn October 19, 2009, the Salem Military Court extended Mr. Othman’s detention period for another eleven days and, on October 27, 2009, his detention was again extended for an additional 13 days. On November 1, the appeal against the extension of his detention was denied.\n\n\n\nMr. Othman was interrogated several times after his first court hearing, and at times the interrogation sessions lasted from 8:00 am until midnight. During one of the sessions, he was threatened that he could spend a total of 180 days in interrogation. He was also indirectly threatened with life imprisonment as the interrogator told him the story of a human rights activist from Nablus who received a life sentence. He was also threatened that “his human rights work would not be helpful as he is now in the hands of the State of Israel”. Mr. Othman has been repeatedly insulted and verbally assaulted during the interrogations. Mr. Othman would also been interrogated daily about his trips to Europe and contacts with European organisations, as well as on issues relating to his human rights activities as a volunteer with the “Stop the Wall Campaign”. He was also asked questions about other staff members of the campaign.\n\n\n\nThe Observatory calls upon the Israeli authorities to release Mr. Mohammad Othman immediately and unconditionally as his detention seems to merely aim at sanctioning his human rights activities, and therefore contravenes the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998.\n\n\n\nBesides, the Observatory urges embassies of European Union member States in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to attend the hearing due to take place on November 8, 2009, in accordance with the Guidelines of the European Union on Human Rights Defenders, as well as to urge the Israeli authorities to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, including the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, in order to create an environment where human rights defenders can operate freely.\n\n\n\nActions requested:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease write to the authorities in Israel urging them to:\n\n\n\n\n\ni. Guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Mohammad Othman;\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Release Mr. Mohammad Othman immediately and unconditionally since his detention is arbitrary as it only aims at sanctioning his human rights activities;\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Put an end to any kind of harassment - including at the judicial level - against Mr. Mohammad Othman and all human rights defenders in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory and ensure in all circumstances that they are able to carry out their work without unjustified hindrances;\n\n\n\n\n\niv. Comply with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998, in particular Article 1, which states that “everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels” and Article 12(2), which provides that “the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually or in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the [...] Declaration”;\n\n\n\n\n\nv. More generally, ensure in all circumstances the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the country and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in accordance with international human rights instruments ratified by Israel, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n\n\nAddresses:\n\n\n\n* Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, Office of the Prime Minister, 3 Kaplan Street, PO Box 187, Kiryat Ben-Gurion, Jerusalem 91919, Israel.

The status of administrative detention denies all civil and political rights to the detainees. Therefore, the authorities do not have to charge the prisoner, nor to bring him to trial.\n\n\n\n[3] The October 8 decision was appealed at the Military Court of Appeals in Ofer on October 14, when the judge declined the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nJoseph\n\n\nat\nWednesday, November 25, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \nTuesday, 24 November 2009\n\n\n        \n      \n\n\n\n\nIrish Police to join national strike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been discussions here about a 'winter of discontent' from the trade unions, with strikes brewing on the London Underground, buses etc. Yesterday saw the settlement of the Leeds bin workers strike, which lasted for 11 weeks, and where it seems from reports that the workers received a reasonable settlement, thanks to the unions.\n\n\n\nBut things are much worse in the Irish Republic. The budget next month is expected to be the most savage in decades and cuts in the public services are at the heart of it. This follows on from a decision by the government to prop up the banks and to create a 'toxic bank' in the shape of NAMA (National Asset Management Agency) and to pour millions of taxpayers Euros into it. According to some economists it could virtually bankrupt the nation for two generations. Now the Fianna Fail/Green government have decided to take on the public sector and the unions have declared a national strike today, with possibly another to follow next month. Schools, council services, public offices etc will be closed. Even the staff in the Irish parliament in Dublin are striking. For the first time in living memory, the Irish police, the Gardai, are joining in the strike, albeit those off duty. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/24/ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many Conservatives the measures being taken against the public sector in Ireland are the blueprint for what they would like to do in the UK - and they are watching developments in Ireland with great interest. They are also quite content to take on the unions and, if possible, defeat them. Their plan is to considerably reduce inheritance tax and assist their friends in high paid positions, at the expense of the lower paid public sector workers. You can already hear this in the economic discourse. Of course, New Labour, after gratefully taking the unions money during the general election, might be planning something similar if Mandelson et al have their way. So the outcome of the strikes and the struggle of the unions in Ireland is important and we should hope that the public sector workers will prevail. The government in Dublin have had no hesitation in protecting the profits of thier cronies and speculator friends and now the public sector workers and those on welfare are being asked to take the blame. As a trade unionist and a radical Green, I send my full support to the Irish workers. It was the great Irish trade union leader Jim Larkin, leader of a major strike in Dublin in 1913, who said: \"The employers cannot carry on industry nor accumulate profits if they have not got the good will of the workers or their acquiescence in carrying on such industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nJoseph\n\n\nat\nTuesday, November 24, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nNewer Posts\n\n\nOlder Posts\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Joseph\n\n\nJoseph Healy has been elected by Lambeth Green Party to stand as the Parliamentary Candidate for the Vauxhall Constituency at the next general election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph is also Number 4 on the Green Party's list of European Parliamentary candidates in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is currently Male Co-Convenor of Green Left, the ecosocialist, anti-capitalist platform within the Green Party.

It can be written, oral,\nimplied or a combination of these.\n\n\nThe main elements of a valid contract of service, or for\nservices, are\n\tthe intention to enter into legal\nrelations\n\tan offer of work and its acceptance i.e.\nan agreement\n\tconsideration e.g. in return for\nperforming work the worker receives payment.\n\nThe contract is an important factor in considering status and is\nof crucial value to a worker because it determines the\nworker’s rights and obligations. It can cover such matters\nas\n\tredundancy pay\n\tsick pay\n\temployment rights.\n\nIt is necessary to establish the\nfull terms and conditions of the contract. These\ninclude any practices or conventions which exist in certain trades\nand industries which, although not expressly agreed between the\nparties, still form part of the agreement. Once you have all the\ninformation, check that the terms of the contract have been kept by\ncomparing what is supposed to have happened with the actual working\narrangements. If there is a difference see\nESM1007 which talks about getting at the\ntrue terms.\n\n\nAlways ask for a copy of a written contract and, if\nappropriate, any other documentation which sets out the terms and\nconditions of the engagement.\n\n\nIt is important to recognise the difference between a\nframework document and an actual contract (of employment or for\nservices). The former will usually set out the terms and conditions\nof engagements, which may be offered in the future. A contract will\nonly be effected when the main elements mentioned above are\nsatisfied and, in particular, when work is offered and accepted. It\nis often the case that the framework document covers workers\ngenerally and, when considering separate engagements for an\nindividual worker, you should examine that document in detail in\norder to determine which clauses apply and which do not.\n\n\n\n\n\tHome | Main Contents | Manual Contents\n\tPrevious Page | Next Page | Top | Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t | \n\n\t© Crown Copyright | \n\n\tTerms & Conditions   | \n\n\tPrivacy policy | \n\n\tAccessibility | \n\n\t \n\n\n\n",

That in itself is (hopefully) an interesting enough story, so rather \nthan trying to give you the definitive account of gender and sexuality issues \nin anime, I'll tell you about that journey of only-partial discovery. (As well \nas this page there's one of 'further comments' which \npeople have emailed to me).\n\nBut first, of course, we'd \nbetter briefly cover: What is anime?\n\nAnime is \nthe term used outside Japan to refer to Japanese animation. (In Japan, anime is \nthe term for animation in general). Anime films, videos and TV shows are based \non the style, and often the content, of manga, which are Japanese comics, \nor what we might call graphic novels.\n\nIndeed \nthe term 'graphic novels' is more than usually appropriate here, since manga are \noften long series written by identifiable, individual authors (rather than the \nteams who are usually responsible for American comics). Furthermore, it is completely \nnormal for manga to be read by adults; and manga come in a broad range of genres, \nas with novels in the West. [Gilles Poitras provides a good \nintroduction to anime].\n\n\n\nAbout \ngender and sexuality in anime\n\nI started looking into anime \nrecently as I'd seen a couple of websites by transgendered people -- male-to-female \ntranssexuals, to be more specific -- who were anime fans and liked 'the nonchalant \npresence of characters from sexual and gender minorities' (as it says at Anime \nfor the Transgendered) -- which sounds cool. As Western viewers will know, \nin American and British \nTV, movies and other popular media, our main male characters are usually identifiably \nmasculine and our leading female characters are usually feminine. Any 'gender \nplay', or non-straight characters, are unusual to say the least. Why would they \nbe more common in Japanese (animated) drama?\n\nIn these websites I'd seen, \ncertain stories were seen as important because they featured characters who switched \nfrom being male to being female (and back). For example, the very popular series \nRanma ½ is about a teenage boy who turns into a girl when he comes \ninto contact with cold water, with, as they say in showbiz, hilarious consequences. \nSimilarly, Futaba-kun Change is a \"slapstick romantic comedy\" \nabout a young man who changes into a woman when he gets excited.\n\n\t \n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\n\nThis fluidity of gender \nsounds, at first glance, quite radical. But this is where things started to fall \napart, as I mentioned at the top. The premises of these tales -- as you may have \nspotted if you are quicker than me -- can actually be seen as rather conservative, \ncouched in fixed and traditional ideas about the difference between men and women, \nwhich produces the 'comedy' of changing from a man to a woman. If gender was irrelevant, \nthere'd be no humour. This premise wouldn't be out of place in an American sitcom \nof the 1960s, as Annalee \nNewitz notes. For further help, I turned to Helen McCarthy, author of The \nAnime Movie Guide. She describes Ranma ½ as a \"formulaic \nand cynical play on romantic stereotypes... conservative and sexist\". Oh \ndear.\n\nSo \nit looked like maybe those transgendered people liked these shows because they \nmight agree with the idea of a fundamental difference between men and women, which \nthat kind of humour is based on. That's also the basis of the idea that there \nare men, and there are women, and you've been born as the wrong one, isn't it? \nSigh. I'm sympathetic to those people -- gender outsiders we like! -- but it's \na can of worms that is better tossed over to B.C. \nHolmes. Meanwhile I'm still despondent that anime failed to be queer-theory-in-the-movies. \nI'd wanted masculinity and femininity to be collapsed, not reinforced and used \nfor traditionalist laughs.\n\n(I could be being unfair \nhere -- these series do at least play with gender, and could be seen to \nbe exposing the performance of gender...).\n\n A Japanese student, Shun, \nemailed me with this comment: \"Ranma ½ did play with male/female \nroles and made jokes based on this, but the important fact in this story is that \nRanma was always being himself. Strong, true to himself, a fighter, rough and \nsensitive at time... just as most people are a mix of 'masculine' and 'feminine' \ntraits, rather than changing identity from one to another. This helped to created \nthe view that differences between women and men may not exist. Futhermore, in \nRanma, female characters such as Akane and others are very strong and unique \nin their own right... They helped to create an acceptance of strong women characters. \nThe bottom line here is: who cares what you are. We all try to be funny, \ntry to make sense of ourselves, try to show off, fall in love and fear to die!\". \nVery interesting points.\n\nBut anyway, what happened \nto 'the nonchalant presence of characters from sexual and gender minorities' ? \nHey hey -- do what you like with the bathwater, but this baby's staying to see \nwhat else we can find...\n\nGender \noutlaws in anime\n\nAnime does nevertheless \ninclude some gay and bisexual characters, as well as other positive plays on gender \nconventions. Shunsuke has created an excellent guide to this area, Josei \nNi. He says: \"I have been an anime fan since January 1996, and in that \ntime I have seen a lot of anime. A lot. And having been on the internet since \nbefore that and talked a lot to anime fans, one thing I noticed was amazing tolerance \nand regular examples of non-heterosexual people and relationships. Even straight \npeople I know who are into anime like the way gay and bisexual relationships are \nportrayed as positive and loving, seeing people as humans and not freaks.\"\n\nHe \ngoes on to say: \"The thing that really struck me about anime as I gradually \ncame to terms with my own bisexuality is the number of positive images and stories \ninvolving homosexuals and bisexuals. Granted, a great number of these are male \nfantasies about lesbian sex [erk!], but there are still a lot of images of loving \nand tenderness to be found. Anime didn't cause me to become bisexual, nor is it \nthe main reason I'm coming out, but anime and the fan community were definitely \na big help in accepting who I am.\"\n\nKaren \nSmith is another anime fan who helped me out. I asked her about this simply \nbecause she obviously had seen a lot of anime, and read about it. Karen said, \n\"I am not sure why it is that anime is like that, but I think it is really cool\". \n\n\n She \nconfirms, \"There are a lot of anime characters that are gay, or they make some \nmen look and act very feminine. For example Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus from \nSailor Moon [pictured right]. Sailor Uranus is a woman but she dresses \nand looks like a man. Everyone thought she was a guy and all the girls liked her. \nHer and Sailor Neptune are in love. They never really explain it that much because \nit is no big deal to them.\" \n\nBen \nKong, of the York University [Canada] Anime and Manga Association, wrote to \nme: \"Parents and educators often cringe when they have an initial glance at anime. \nOne example [again] is Sailor Moon, an animated series that found success \nin Japan, Canada and the U.S. The presence of transgendered, gay and bisexual \ncharacters was strong in this series, as two of the ten heroic characters were \nlesbians and three others transformed from male to female when they summoned their \nsuperhero powers. Considering the fact that [the North American] marketers had \ntargeted children as their primary audience, this became a hotly debated issue \nin the U.S. and Canada. Therefore, North American networks aired the early episodes \nof Sailor Moon only, where the aforementioned characters were not present.\" \nPart of Ben Kong's explanation for why such characters appear in anime is that \nanime is an art form, and a much more complex kind of drama than Western animations. \n\n\n \"Anime \nis different from most conventional forms of animation here in the West for its \ncharacter development. Similar to a soap opera or mini-series, each character \ndevelops personality, maturity and a plot as the series continues. For example, \nSailor Moon goes from a frightened teen in the show's initial episode, and develops \ninto a more mature and caring heroine in later shows. She essentially 'grows up' \non the screen each day, until eventually becoming a Queen and a mother. Compare \nthat to the popular animated shows Charlie Brown or South Park, \nwhere characters carry the same identity and status for each episode.\"  \n\nThis was helpful, but didn't \nseem to explain why it would be that the Japanese would be interested in having, \nand willing to accept, gay, bisexual and other queer characters in their animated \ndramas.\n\nAnime \nin the Japanese cultural context \n\nJennifer \nDiane Reitz is the writer of a webpage on anime with transgendered themes. \nShe has been an otaku -- a committed anime fan -- almost a decade. \"During \nthat time I have immersed myself in as much Japanese art, culture, language and \nsubculture as I could,\" she told me. \"I have correspondents from Japan and constantly \naccumulate information. I regularly chat with, see films with, and visit the otaku \nshops of my Japanese friends.\" Jennifer should be well qualified to explain why \nanime happily includes these queer components, then.  \n\n Jennifer \nsays: \"In modern day Japan, queerness in general, by which I mean not simply homosexuality \nbut transsexuality, transgenderism, and bisexuality as well, are not accepted, \nbut neither are they a matter of grave disgrace either. Rather the subject is \nsimply one that is considered very private -- in general, more private than even \nheterosexual relations.  \n\n \"Heterosexual expression \nitself is kept private, with such acts as simple kissing being considered inappropriate \nfor public display, and in many homes, inappropriate even for children to see \ntheir parents performing. Homosexuality is considered just beyond the already \nhighly private expressions of affection so common in western culture.  \n\n \"In ancient Japan, homosexuality \nwas simply considered a rare but perfectly acceptable behavior [however, see below]; \nthe opening of Japan to western culture is primarily responsible for what mild \ndistaste towards homosexuality exists. The foundations of this distaste are religions, \noriginating for the most part from two sources, the teachings of Buddhism, and \nthe influence of Christianity. The Christian influence comes more from the deliberate \nassimilation of western culture that Japan instituted than from conversion; it \nis estimated only one per cent of the Japanese people are Christian\".\n\nHowever, contradicting \nthis, I was emailed by Shun, a Japanese student studying at an Australian University. \nHe is certain that Jennifer is wrong about this: \"I have seen that Jennifer \nDiane Reitz has said 'In ancient Japan, homosexuality was simply considered a \nrare but perfectly acceptable behavior'... This is just so not true. I would, \nas Japanese, like you to remove this misleading comment. Homosexuality was never \naccepted in Japanese society... it was suppressed just as much as in the West\". \n[See the 'further comments' page for more on this]. \n\n Anyhow, \nJennifer continues: \"Homosexuality, transsexuality and transgenderism are \nconsidered exotic, and therefore interesting. This fascination is partly erotic, \nbut mostly one of the excitement of the unfamiliar. Just as a fantastic character \nsuch as a magical being or interstellar entity is stimulating, so is the exotic \nnature of the character who crosses gender boundaries or common sexual expectations. \nBecause such characters are larger than life by virtue of being exotic, they become \nmore likely to be portrayed as heroic rather than villainous, or at the very least, \ncomedic yet with a human side.\" \n\nSo is \nJapan more liberal about these issues?\n\nJennifer says: \"This \nis not to say that Japan is a queer-positive society overall, for it is not. Japanese \nsociety is more accepting of many things western cultures actively seek to destroy, \nbut only under the understanding that the matters in question are kept private. \nFew Japanese parents would welcome the prospect of a queer child, and there is \na certain exclusion offered openly queer individuals in Japan, for they are considered \nodd, or different, and being 'different' in Japan is a source of interest, but \nalso immediate suspicion. \n\n \"So, \nperhaps the best way to understand the representation of queer folk as positive, \nor at least comically human, characters in Japanese media, is to see Japan as \na culture fascinated by difference, precisely because it is maintained as a homogeneous \nsociety. It is a culture that is not overly hateful towards queer issues, but \nneither is embracing by any means, and finds acceptance of the queer mostly as \nentertainment, or as a hidden and therefore unoffensive, subculture. The hidden \nnature of queer culture in Japan is not, however, linked with dread fear of violence \nas might be often found in western culture, but is rather more an extension of \nthe general social disdain for overt expressions of intimacy of any sort.  \n\n \"There are also places \nheld for queer folk in ancient Japanese historical account, and those places - \ncertain performers, famous court musicians, the companions of certain famous warlords, \nand the like, are not at all unholy or wretched. Indeed some are exceedingly noble \nor self sacrificingly heroic. This must also flavor the portrayal of queer folk \nin anime and manga. \n\n She concludes, \"Japan \ndoes not yet have the full taint of of the hate and intolerance of western religion, \nand in that is without the motivation to wholly condemn the queer.\" \n\nRepresentations \nof women (and men) in anime \n\nSo what about gender representations \nin anime more generally? Eri \nIzawa grew up in a Japanese household in the USA -- punctuated by a few visits \nto Japan -- and began reading manga in the mid-1970s. In his interesting essay \non this subject, he suggests that in the 1990s Japan remains a sexist, conservative \nculture -- although the very fact that this is noted by Eri's friends in Japan \nmay indicate that things might slowly change. \n\nEri's \nanalysis of gender relationships in anime begins with a catalogue of depressing \nexamples of female characters in stereotypical, subservient roles. On the more \noptimistic side, he notes that in some anime, women and men are shown to have \na \"stable, equal relationship\". Eri writes, \"Usually \nthe male is assumed to be stronger, but the female is often smarter (at least \nacademically) and/or more stable. There's a balance here, and both sides have \na respect for the other, personally and sometimes professionally\". \n\n  \nFurthermore, Eri notes that in some anime, the female heroes are 'super women' \n-- such as Mikami (Ghost Sweeper Mikami), Gally (Gunnm) and Natsuki \n(Natsuki Crisis) -- who \"are stronger and smarter than everyone else \naround them, including their love interests. And, unlike some other [manga and \nanime characters], they are not ashamed to be better, and they fight hard to stay \nsharp and competent\". Male partners strive reach a similar level. \"The \ntrend is for the heroine to remain independent and aloof until the male character \ngets enough of a 'grip' to improve himself until he is worthy of her\".  \n\n Later \nin his essay, Eri writes: \"Recently, with the introduction of Western comics \n(you know, skin-tight costumes), physical exaggeration is more prevalent than \never before -- women with voluptuous figures, men with ridiculously huge muscles. \nAnd as a side note, some manga have a subtle fascination with homosexuality. Finally, \nthough, to help straighten the record: as much as some manga depict women in sexually-tinged \nembarrassing situations, some also depict men in such situations, too. The Japanese \nare far more open about nudity and sex than, say, Americans, and so feel free \nto poke a lot more humor at it -- and not all the humor is degrading to women\". \n \n\nIn conclusion, Eri says, \n\"If we took the 'average' of the attitude to relationships (at least in young \npeople's manga, not in adult-oriented stuff), I think that the average attitude \nwould come out to be male-chauvinistic, but a lot less so than twenty years ago, \nand possibly less so than Japanese society itself. As much as there are stereotypical \nmanga where girls are weak and wilting or perhaps just lust objects, there are \nnewer manga where girls are equal partners, or sometimes even 'ahead' of the guys. \nThis is interesting, because the rest of Japanese society does not appear to be \nquite as enlightened. Perhaps manga-writers are a vanguard of society, paving \nthe way for the masses\".  \n\nFinally... \n\nWe'll leave it on that upbeat \nnote, then... One of the curious questions which haven't \nbeen resolved here is about the extent to which a female character such as Iria \n[shown right] can be an empowering female icon whilst at the same time \nbeing a sex object capable of getting teenage boys very hot under the collar... \n\nNOW READ \nTHE FURTHER COMMENTS...\n\nSince I wrote the above \npage (mostly in 1999) I have been emailed by various people about it. Some of \nthe most interesting comments - which contain many valuable and well-informed \nobservations - appear on the FURTHER COMMENTS \npage (created 2002).\n\n \n\n\n\tMany \nthanks to Jennifer Diane Reitz, Ben Kong, Karen Smith, and Shunsuke for their \nhelp with the preparation of this page.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n  \n\n",
