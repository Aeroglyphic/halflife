You should choose the corset size that matches your bra measurement. Because a corset is so adjustable, each size can accommodate an A to D cup. So if you are a 32A, B, C, or D cup, (for example) a 32-inch size should fit you fine. If you are bigger than a 'D' cup, you need to go up a size - so if you are a 32DD, go for a size 34, for example.\nExplore more from our collections…\nLingerie & Clothing > Sexy Plus Size 18+ > Babydolls & Chemises\nLingerie & Clothing > Sexy Plus Size 18+ > Romantic Lingerie\nLingerie & Clothing > Sexy Plus Size 18+ > Sexy Sleepwear\nAll Dreamgirl Lingerie products\nCustomer Reviews\nDreamgirl Plus Size Charmeuse Chemise and Robe\n6 out of 10\n9 out of 10\n(4 reviews) Write your own review\nOrder by:\nNewest\nMost helpful\nRating\nValentine's without the tackiness\nReviewed: 09 May 2012 by kayfabe, a Married Straight Male\nThe pink colour was great for being suitable for Valentine's without being predictable tacky red or yet another black. The fit is good, particularly as there's no wiring or other shaping involved.\nThe material's look and feel is simply okay: it doesn't look cheap, but it's certainly not glam either. The robe would be good if you took this on a dirty weekend away, but be aware it's a little short if you were hoping to wear this around the house.\nIt's cool wash only and drip dry, so you can't just chuck it in with a normal load. Even if you've only had this on for a moment before it's cast aside in a fury of passion, it only needs to be in the same room as some lube to get stained and need a wash every time.\nAll in all, it's good enough but you may find it's a bit of a compromise and (depending on your needs) look for something that's either cheaper or more luxurious.\nOverall Rating:\n6 out of 10\nMaterial Quality:\n5 out of 10\nBuild Quality:\n8 out of 10\nFit:\n7 out of 10\nSex Appeal:\n7 out of 10\nValue for money:\n4 out of 10\nPros\nGood fit, well made.\nCons\nNot a luxury look. Washing a bit fiddly.\nBottom line\nRelatively cheap, relatively cheerful.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nFar too tactile to be healthy\nReviewed: 07 May 2012 by boing-boing, a Married Straight Male\nI wanted to buy some sexy semi-practical style lingerie, after umming and ahhing about all the options for a few weeks. I decided to go for one of these as it was subtle but still sexy and looked like it could be worn as night wear regularly without being too cumbersome.\nThe Chemise and Robe set are really well made, with none of cheap, thin fabric feel to it that often plagues 'adult' wear.\nThe chemise is highly adjustable using the lace up satin straps at the back of the garment. This means with a bit of practice you can get the chemise to hug your body perfectly without it being too clingy or unflattering.\nThe robe has just the right weight to it and is also very adjustable as it wraps around the front of the body more so than most.\nIt does take a little practice to do up the chemise lacing yourself and can be quite fiddly, but it's a very minor point really. Other than that it's great but does need a good iron when you unpack it as satin loves the creases!\nBe warned though this item will make your OH paw you incessantly!\nOverall Rating:\n9 out of 10\nMaterial Quality:\n9 out of 10\nBuild Quality:\n9 out of 10\nFit:\n10 out of 10\nSex Appeal:\n10 out of 10\nValue for money:\n9 out of 10\nPros\nVery adjustable.\nCons\nNothing.\nBottom line\nBeautiful, practical and sexy.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nPure luxury\nReviewed: 01 May 2012 by rachel, a Single Straight Female\nAs soon as I put this on I felt special. The fabric feels lovely and just slides over your skin. I found it a little bit tricky to adjust the straps properly and I did look a bit lopsided until I got it right, but once it's properly adjusted it hangs beautifully. My husband loves this and can't stop touching me when I wear it.\nDidn't get the padded hanger it was supposed to come with though. :-(\nOverall Rating:\n9 out of 10\nMaterial Quality:\n10 out of 10\nBuild Quality:\n10 out of 10\nFit:\n9 out of 10\nSex Appeal:\n9 out of 10\nValue for money:\n9 out of 10\nPros\nFabric feels gorgeous.\nCons\nLittle bit fiddly to adjust the back straps.\nBottom line\nSultry rather than slutty.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nOrder by:\nNewest\nMost helpful\nRating\nSee all 4 Dreamgirl Plus Size Charmeuse Chemise and Robe reviews…\nSuggestions & Questions\nGot a question about this product?

Thank you flowers can be used for both personal and business situations because they can be made to suit any occasion or relationship.\nWhen it comes to sending thank you flowers a person has to make sure they are sending the right thank you flowers. There are many considerations when sending thank you flowers that could make them a perfect gift or a horrible mistake.\nThe overall design of the thank you flowers should suit the occasion and the relationship between the sender and the person receiving the flowers. In a business situation this is especially important. A person would send something different to their mom then they would their boss. It is important to consider this when choosing your thank you flower gift.\nThank you flowers can also be symbolic in nature. Most people have some basic idea of flowers and how they relate to symbolism. That is what makes a rose appropriate for someone who is close but not so appropriate for an acquaintance.\nWhen choosing thank your flowers a person needs to make sure they choose the right type of flower. Colors and the flower type are important choices to make in designing thank you flowers.\n Flowers are beautiful, and almost everyone likes at least some type of flower. There are indoor flowers, outdoor flowers, and flowers that can thrive just about anywhere. Flowers can really enhance a room, home or office. Their beauty is natural and was created by nature for our enjoyment. This is why women look forward to receiving bouquets of lovely roses or some other type of flowers for birthdays, Valentine's Day, and other holidays throughout the year. Or they even receive them just because, when there is no holiday at all. For some reason, the mere sight of a lovely bushel of flowers brings a smile to most women's faces. Even some men enjoy the sight of flowers, although most probably wouldn't admit it.\nThere are many places to buy flowers. Flower shops, nurseries, and even some grocery stores sell flowers. In some large areas, private vendors will even sell flowers on the streets for special holidays such as Easter, Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. This is a very convenient way to purchase flowers for special occasions, especially for busy individuals but buying online is quicker and more reliable.\nflorist, florists, that deliver flowers, send flowers, flower delivery, wedding florists, florist shop, florist online, wedding flowers, flower shop, flowers online, floral arrangements, flower pictures, flower gifts, order flowers, silk flowers, tropical flowers, sympathy flowers.\n \nTo contact Flower Direct.

There they would stand, elbows bent, before bouncing up and down for the final momentous lift off! Whilst these kinds of skills are small steps for adults, they are giant leaps for toddler-kind. They fall under the umbrella term of ‘motor skills’ and involve a finite co-ordination of specific functions in the brain, bones, muscles and nervous system.\nLocal Companies\n(Companies listed on this page are in no way endorsed by Supernanny or Supernanny.co.uk)\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 1446 739635\n126 Holton Road\nBarry\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 1446 739635\n126 Holton Road\nBarry GB.CF634HH\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2037 3998\nCentral Square\nCardiff\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2037 3998\nCentral Square\nCardiff GB.CF101EP\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nIan Allan Bookshop\n+44 (0) 29 2039 0615\n31 Royal Arcade\nCardiff\nView More Info\nIan Allan Bookshop\n+44 (0) 29 2039 0615\n31 Royal Arcade\nCardiff GB.CF101AE\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2037 6119\n3 Wood Street\nCardiff\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2037 6119\n3 Wood Street\nCardiff GB.CF101EN\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2035 9193\nStation Terrace\nCardiff\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 29 2035 9193\nStation Terrace\nCardiff GB.CF102FY\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 2920 708304\n12 Windsor Road\nPenarth\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 2920 708304\n12 Windsor Road\nPenarth GB.CF641JH\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nForbidden Planet\n+44 (0) 29 2022 8885\n5 Duke Street\nCardiff\nView More Info\nForbidden Planet\n+44 (0) 29 2022 8885\n5 Duke Street\nCardiff GB.CF101AY\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nChristian Bookshop\n+44 (0) 29 2022 0586\n7 Wyndham Arcade\nCardiff\nView More Info\nChristian Bookshop\n+44 (0) 29 2022 0586\n7 Wyndham Arcade\nCardiff GB.CF101FH\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWaterstone's\n+44 (0) 29 2066 5606\n2A The Hayes\nCardiff\nView More Info\nWaterstone's\n+44 (0) 29 2066 5606\n2A The Hayes\nCardiff GB.CF101WB\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 2920 891141\nM4\nPontyclun\nView More Info\nWHSmith\n+44 (0) 2920 891141\nM4\nPontyclun GB.CF728SA\nView Complete Profile\nClick Here\nData Provided by:\n \nData Provided by:\n \nMotor Skill Matters\nMotor Skill Matters\nBy  Supernanny Team 18/07/2007 In basic terms, motor skills include any kind of deliberate movement. At first a baby will wave its hands involuntarily and occasionally, much to their surprise, one will pass in front of their eyes. It can be months before they work out that they can control the strange thing waving around in front of them. All babies go through the stage of moving their hands around with a \"wow-look-what-I-can-do\" expression on their face.\nMotor skills fall into two categories: gross and fine. Gross motor skills include head movements, rolling, sitting up, crawling, standing and walking. These movements use the body’s larger muscles, which are the first to develop and act as the foundation for all motor skills. Fine motor skills are slighter, more precise movements that utilise the smaller muscle groups. These finer skills first appear in the form of grasping or gripping, and later include more complex manoeuvres such as cutting or colouring.\nChildren are pre-programmed to develop their motor skills through practice. However there are a number of ways this process can be helped along. These involve encouraging specific activities and providing children with the right equipment so they can practice their skills to perfection. Below is a brief guide to the activities that will benefit your child’s motor skills at each stage of development.\n0-8 Months\nEncourage younger babies to move and lift their heads by calling them or rattling something to get their attention. Hold their hands and lift them off their backs to sit , or roll them onto their side. This familiarises them with the feel of these basic movement. Rattles, activity gyms and mobiles will stimulate a child to learn fine motor skills like grasping and gripping.\n8-18 Months\nProvide toys which that encourage more precise movements, like building blocks, or those with buttons. Try introducing sand and water play. Placing exciting and attractive objects slightly out of reach will encourage gross motor skills like crawling and walking.\n18-24 Months\nThis is a good stage for us to capitalise on the ‘copy cat’ mentality of our toddlers. Toy kitchens and dummy DIY sets are good proudly showing off their finer skills. Balls, ‘sit in’ vehicles and push along trolleys will help practice their gross motor skills. Playing musical instruments and listening to music will encourage both fine and gross skills, from nodding and clapping, to dancing and jumping.\n24-36 Months\nClick here to read more from the Super Nanny\nWhat:\nWhere:\nRelated Topics\nTeaching Your Teen to Manage Money Barry\nWhen a teenager gets his first part-time job it’s just as exciting for Mum and Dad as it i...\nMusic Related Activities for Kids Barry\nThe Best Electronic Educational Toys Barry\n© Ricochet Limited 2009\nprivacy policy\nterms & conditions\nadvertise with us\ndigital agency\narticle index\nsitemap\nhelp\nSign up for enewsletter"],

        "content_text":["Untitled Document\nPower\nfor the people, by the people - literally.\nExtracting energy from humans has been something that’s been\ndone for thousands of years, the most obvious example being slavery.\nHowever, enter Trevor Baylis and his Piezo Electric Shoes - shoes that\ncan generate small amounts of electricity from the motion of walking!\nThe potential for electric shoes is huge due to the increasing number\nof small electrical devices that we now carry around with us on a day\nto day basis, such as mobile phones, PDAs and mp3 players, which all\nrequire power at regular intervals. All these devices would benefit\nfrom this technology which charges ‘on the go’.\nThe Media Lab at MIT has also investigated this technology and NASA\nhas researched the possibility of using thermoelectric clothing to harvest\npower. To date these technologies are in their infancy and only generate\naround 1-3 Watts of electricity. However, there is the potential to\nincrease output, and as technology develops further, electrical devices\nare being improved to require less power, an example being LEP displays.\nAn obvious application\nfor this technology would be in the army. Soldiers are dependant on GPS\nnavigation systems, night vision goggles, satellite\nphones, torches etc, which all require electrical power. Most of\nthe weight in a soldier’s kit is taken up by spare batteries. This\ntechnology would allow a soldier to carry a set of universal rechargeable\nbatteries that could be charged on the go by their body heat and\nthe motion of walking. This might save the soldiers life because they\nwere\nable to call for assistance when normally battery power would have\nbeen spent."],

I think possibly one of the few days without rain this summer!\nThe day after their wedding when I was offloading the cards and going through their images I had to pinch myself. I love photographing weddings because I love to photograph the moments that happen between loved ones and friends. The proper heartfelt moments where you witness something, feel it deep in your chest and snap a picture of it quickly before the moment gets lost and forgotten. Sarah and Jamesy’s day was choc full of them.\nMake up was done beautifully by Jennifer Ireland\nSarah’s Mum and Dad waited for her at the bottom of the stairs to see her for the first time\nThis was my first wedding at Larchfield Estate and it was simply stunning\nBefore you even get to the ceremony location you walk through the beautiful gardens. There was something pretty magical about witnessing Sarah and her Dad doing this together\nWhen erveryone was relaxing after the ceremony Sarah’s grandfather just kept walking around Sarah and photographing her\nI’ll not tell you what Jamesy said to give Sarah a fit of the giggles\nWhen we snuck back into the gardens I don’t think anyone even noticed we’d been gone taking photographs\nThe very last shot out of the camera. Speeches were over, cake was cut and Jamesy was grabbed by his brother for a hug. Perfect moment to end a lovely day.\nAll my love to Sarah and Jamesy. Thank you for inviting me along to witness such a lovely day xox\ntags: Larchfield Estate, Lisburn\nTweet\nNext entry »\n« Previous entry\n2013 Carly Rodgers\n-\nphotography blog site"],

But the reality is that the sooner you start paying into a pension the better your income in retirement is likely to be.\nPensions are long-term investments with special tax rules - for example, contributions currently qualify for Income Tax relief at your highest rate.\nYou can't access the money in your pension until you reach age 50, going up to 55 by 2010. Some pension schemes have additional rules about when you can take your benefits - check with your scheme provider.\nWhile there are alternative ways of saving these usually come with their own risks. The pension is generally seen as the most suitable option for most people.\nContributions\nThere is no limit on the amount of contributions that can be paid. There is a limit on the amount which enjoys tax relief. The annual limit is the lower of one times salary or £235,000. There is no limit at all in the year in which benefits are taken in full. Those not earning or earning less than £3,600 per year, will be able to contribute up to £3,600 per annum.\nSo let us help you find the pension which is right for you.\nThere are three main types of non-State pension. They are:-\nOccupational salary-related schemes - offered by some employers;\nOccupational defined contribution schemes (also called money purchase pensions) - offered by some employers; and\nStakeholder pensions and personal pensions - offered by some employers, or you can start one yourself. You may also be offered a group personal pension at work. These are also money purchase pensions.\nWhat are the benefits?\nAlthough you don't have to join any pension scheme offered through your job, it's usually a good idea to join an occupational pension scheme if it's available because:-\nyour employer normally contributes; and\noften you also get other benefits, such as:\nlife insurance which pays a lump sum and/or pension to your dependants if you die while still in service;\na pension if you have to retire early because of ill-health; and pensions for your spouse and other dependants when you die.\nMortgages\nChoosing a mortgage is probably the biggest financial decision you will make. However with thousands of mortgages to choose from it can seem like an impossible maze to find your way through.\nA mortgage is a sum of money borrowed from a bank or building society in order to purchase a property. The money is then paid back to the Lender over a fixed period of time together with accrued interest. There are many different types of mortgages and there will be one out there that best suits your requirements. If you're going to make the most of your mortgage, you need to minimise the amount of interest that you pay.\nWe can find a mortgage product to suit your own individual requirements. Whether you are a first time buyer, wish to remortgage, we will endeavour to recommend a product to suit your needs. A mortgage is potentially the largest financial commitment of your life and, therefore, every enquiry is treated with the respect that it deserves.\nRemortgages\nYour mortgage may have been the best deal for your circumstances at the time but is it still performing as well as it could? You may well be paying more than you need to, so a regular review of how your mortgage compares may result in significant savings by remortgaging to a different lender. Remortgaging is a great way to escape high variable or fixed interest rates and more and more UK homeowners are moving their mortgages to save money.\nAs well as reducing your monthly payments, you can also use remortgaging to release the equity that's built-up in your property over time. Most homeowners have experienced a significant rise in the value of their property in recent years. Remortgaging to a different lender may enable you to release some of that capital to make improvements to your home, or perhaps buy a new car or take the family on that long overdue holiday. Alternatively, some homeowners may release equity to repay outstanding loans and credit cards, therefore reducing their monthly expenditure. A reduction in the monthly payments is likely to mean an increase in the term and the overall debt.\nWhen you re-mortgage, you are essentially replacing your existing mortgage with a new one, shifting your debt from one lender to another. There are thousands of mortgages available across the market , contact us now to see if there is one there to suit you.\nIn recent years remortgaging has become a much simpler and more common process. The whole process can often be completed in less than four weeks. More and more lenders are offering incentives to remortgage - often free legal and arrangement fees.\nStandard Variable Mortgages\nVariable Rate Mortgages\nWith this type of product the monthly repayment figure can either increase or decrease in accordance with the Lenders interest rates at the time. You always pay the current rate with no hidden extra charges. The rate is normally influenced by the Bank of England's Base Rate. Be aware that this can vary amongst the lenders in the Market place. Generally there are no arrangement fees payable. It is usually the rate that customers revert to after a fixed, capped or discount period ends.\nMost people don't choose an SVR mortgage; it's the rate you are automatically switched to when your initial offer period expires. For this reason it's good to think about re-mortgaging a few months before this would happen so you can take advantage of a better mortgage deal, but check you aren't tied in first. But it's never too late to remortgage to a cheaper deal just check the terms and conditions first.\nWhat does it mean for you?\nUsually you can leave your lender without any penalties or problems.\nYou're in control. You can usually pay back extra amounts (and cut your interest costs) without a penalty.\nIt moves with interest rates. So if interest rates go up, so will your monthly payment.\nIt will almost certainly be expensive compared to other deals.\nThe lender may not reduce, or may delay reducing, their variable rate even if the Bank of England rate goes down.\nFixed Rate Mortgages\nThis type of product is ideal if you want the security of a guaranteed repayment figure for a set period of time, as the mortgage interest rate will remain the same for the stated period. In general this can be for a period of 2, 3, 5,10 or 15 years. After the period finishes then the rate will revert to the mortgage lenders standard variable rate. An arrangement fee is often charged by the lender. An early repayment charge may apply.\nWhat does it mean for you?\nYour payments will stay the same in that period, even if interest rates go up.\nThis gives you the security of knowing that you can afford your payments and will make it easier for you to budget.\nIf rates go down, you won't benefit. Your payments will stay at the higher rate.\nYou may not be able to make overpayments and pay off the loan early without penalties.\nEarly Repayment Charges\nMany fixed rate deals have an associated early repemption penalty. Most mortgage lenders offer a great mortgage rate for a set period, during which time, should you leave, or pay off the mortgage early, you could be liable for a charge. This is usually a percentage of the outstanding mortgage.\nA number of lenders also employ an extended tie-in. In this case the early repayment charge is payable even after the fixed rate deal has ended. And as most lenders switch you to their standard variable rate (typically around 2% higher than base rate) this can result in you paying a lot for your home loan. Therefore it is usually best to avoid mortgage deals with extended tie-ins. Your mortgage adviser should explain this to you at the outset.\nFirst Time Buyers\nBuying a house is one of the most important purchases you will make. It's harder to get on the property ladder today than it's ever been. But there are many ways first-time buyers can get a leg up.\nBuying property for the first time makes it an even more daunting prospect as it can be an extremely expensive time. With so many factors to consider, it can be difficult to know where to begin when looking for a mortgage or for advice on the whole house buying process.\nThere are a wide range of providers and mortgages across the market providing a huge selection to choose from, and useful though it may be to have plenty of choice, it can leave you feeling completely confused.\nHowever do not be put off as there are plenty of lenders who have many schemes available for first time buyers and these can also include fee legal fees or surveys .\nIf you're having trouble finding the cash to consider buying in the first place, here are some ideas that may be useful:\nGet help from parents\nThis is not an option for some people but, according to a recent report, two-fifths of First Time Buyers are getting help from their parents -- usually in the form of a deposit. If your parents can afford to give or lend you a lump sum to help you bridge the gap between the price of a home and the mortgage you can support, then don't turn down such an offer if they can afford it.\nAlternatively, they may be happy to buy the house with you on the understanding that you will buy them out of their share later when you can afford it or that they get a share of any growth in value when you sell up. You could ask them to act as guarantor for the mortgage but that would mean a big commitment on their part as they are liable if you fail to meet your mortgage payments.\nGet a graduate mortgage\nFollowing on from parental help, you might find that you qualify for a graduate mortgage. These enable you to borrow more than the standard amount based on your salary with the help of a guarantor such as a parent. They're different to standard guarantor mortgages in that the guarantee is only for the portion of the mortgage that is over and above the standard amount as opposed to the entire mortgage. The guarantee lasts until the borrower is earning enough to cover the whole loan at which point the guarantor is released.\nSo if your parents aren't in a position to guarantee the whole mortgage, they might be able to back up part of it. As long as you can afford the actual repayments yourself, they shouldn't be out of pocket.\nBuy with a friend\nYou might not be able to afford to buy by yourself but you could possibly manage it if you went halves or even thirds with a friend or two in the same position. This method is becoming increasingly common - after all, if you've been renting a flat with your best mate from university for the last couple of years, why not continue sharing but in your own home.\nThere are major considerations though (such as what happens when one person wants to sell but the other doesn't) so make sure you agree, on a legal basis, the ground rules before signing on the dotted line. Each of you should have your own solicitor to look over any legal agreements to ensure you are fully protected from your co-owner should the friendship go pear-shaped.\nYou should usually also make sure you buy your property as \"Tenants in Common\". This will mean that your half will become part of your estate in the event of something happening to you, rather than passing automatically to your co-owner.\nGet a lodger mortgage\nIt's now possible to get a mortgage which takes account of the expected extra income from a lodger. So even if you don't earn quite enough to manage the mortgage by yourself, it may be feasible with help from a lodger. You can earn up to £4,250 a year under the Rent-a-Room scheme without having to pay tax on the income and this extra income might just make the difference when it comes to affordability. If you ask a friend to be your lodger it won't be much different to renting a flat with them. Otherwise, choose your lodger carefully!\nGet a longer mortgage\nThe usual length of a first-time mortgage is 25 years which sounds like a scarily long period of time. But it's not unusual for people to upgrade to their next home a few years later and take out a new mortgage for exactly the same length of time. So the idea of looking for a 30-year mortgage in the first place, or maybe even longer, needn't be dismissed out of hand.\nThese days some lenders are looking at affordability rather than straightforward income multiples. Being offered three or even four times your gross salary isn't much use if you live in an area where house prices are rather higher than that. But if you could get a mortgage that was spread over a longer-than-usual period so that your monthly payments were lower, it might make it more affordable.\nThe crucial thing to look for is that, even if there is an initial lock-in period, you subsequently have the facility to overpay when you can afford to. The longer the mortgage, the more you'll pay overall so your ultimate aim should be to overpay when feasible thus reducing the length of the mortgage term.\nKey Worker Living Programme\nIf you work in the education, health, police, fire or prison services, you could try the Key Worker Living Programme, which is geared towards key workers who can't afford to live near to where they work.\nThe government is pumping £690 million into the programme, which will offer a variety of help in the form of subsidised loans or shared ownership depending on the type of scheme being offered in your local area. Bear in mind that, as it's aimed at areas where house prices are considered to be prohibitively expensive, at the moment it is only available in London and the South East.\nRight To Buy Scheme\nThe Right To Buy scheme enables local authority secure tenants with at least two years' tenancy to buy their homes at a discount price.\nHomeBuy Scheme\nThe HomeBuy scheme is a government-led initiative offered by the Housing Corporation and is sub-divided into three sections:\nNew Build HomeBuy, where you share ownership of your home with a housing association and pay rent for the proportion you do not own;\nOpen Market HomeBuy, where you part-buy a property and get a loan from a housing association for the rest; and\nSocial HomeBuy, where housing association and local authority tenants are helped to buy their current home.\nIn 2005, the First Time Buyers' Initiative was also added to the HomeBuy scheme. Under this scheme, the government plans to make 15,000 homes available over five years, primarily to key workers. It is another shared equity scheme, with English Partnerships owning the remainder of the equity up to a maximum of 50%.\nSome of the above options may not be appealing or even feasible in your own circumstances. But it is a rare homeowner who will tell you that they managed to get on the property ladder without making any initial sacrifices of any kind. These options all offer possible solutions that are comparatively short-term and you may spot one that hadn't occurred to you. If so, investigate further and then wrestle with the troublesome question of what the housing market's going to do and whether now is the right time to buy!\nLife Insurance\nLife Insurance policies pay out if you die within a specified period. This is usually the cheapest way to provide financial protection for your family in the event of your death.\nWhy do I need life insurance?\nComing to terms with the loss of a loved one is never an easy thing to do and adding financial burden to the grief can make coping increasingly difficult. Receiving a lump sum of money can help to support your family or even a business partner after you die. Some of the reasons to take out life insurance could include:\nMortgage Repayment - do you wish to arrange for your mortgage to be paid off?\nReplacing the main breadwinners salary - ensuring the family does not fall on hard times after your death.\nCovering childcare costs - the death of the main childcare provider could lead to the need for childcare expenses.\nEducation expenses - cover for school/university fees after the death of the main earner.\nWhatever the reason it is important to ensure your family can maintain the standard of living to which they were accustomed. It is clear that there are plenty of reasons to look for the most suitable life insurance policy for your personal circumstances. Getting the correct quote is an important part of finding the right policy.\nLevel Term\nLevel term assurance pays out if you die or, as in the case with some policies, you are diagnosed as having a terminal illness during the term of the policy. If you live to the end of the term, the policy expires and no payment is made. Similarly, if you stop paying the premiums at any time, cover will cease. However, some policies may offer a waiver of premium option that allows the policy to remain in force under certain circumstances (disability etc.).\nDecreasing Term Assurance\nThe lump sum payout on offer with decreasing term assurance, as you might guess, decreases in size over time. The advantage of the reducing life cover under this type of policy is that premiums are likely to be lower too. Decreasing term assurance is also described sometimes as mortgage protection insurance. It is commonly used to protect the repayment of a reducing debt - such as a repayment mortgage, a loan, school fees etc. Some policies may offer a waiver of premium option. If you live to the end of the term the policy expires and no payment is made. Similarly, if you stop paying the premiums at any time, cover will cease.\nConvertible Term Assurance\nThe sum assured stays the same for the term of the policy. However, for an additional cost you will have an option to convert this original plan, or part of it, to another type of policy such as an increasing term assurance, a whole of life policy or an endowment, without further medical evidence being required. If you stop paying the premiums at any time, cover will cease.\nFamily Income Benefit\nFamily Income Benefit (FIB) provides a tax free regular income which is paid out for the remaining term of the policy if you die. FIB can provide a replacement income and may be index-linked to inflation, so that cover remains the same in real terms. If you live to the end of the term, the policy expires and no payment is made. Similarly, if you stop paying the premiums at any time, cover will cease.\nDeath in Service Benefit\nDeath in service benefit is the name for cover, which can be provided by your employer. If you die while employed then it will typically pay between two and four times your salary, a useful boost to your own assurance arrangements. However, you should review your cover if your lifestyle changes or you move jobs.\nCritical Illness\nCritical Illness pays out a lump sum if you survive a specified critical illness, such as some forms of cancer, a stroke, MS, a major organ transplant, coronary artery bypass, heart attack and kidney failure. You can use the payout to pay for medical treatment, pay off your mortgage or anything else to ease your financial worries while you hopefully recover.\nThe policies can be complicated and can vary widely with regard to the illnesses covered so it is important to receive the correct advice.\nIf you have children and one was diagnosed with a critical illness and was in a hospital many miles away it is likely that you would want to stay with them or at the very least visit them everyday. Could you afford to do that? Most Critical illness policies include benefits that are paid out if one of your children should suffer in this manner at no extra cost, without affecting your own personal benefits from the policy.\nThe cost of the cover is normally calculated from the level of the benefit, however if you have a budget in mind, companies will calculate a level of benefit from whatever you feel you can afford. Some companies have a minimum premium for this benefit of £5.00 each month, so the cover can start at an affordable level.\nOur experienced financial advisers will be able to help guide you through the most suitable critical illness cover options available to you. They can discuss at further length with you, a suitable level of cover to best suit your individual requirements. We are able to look at products from within the UK marketplace.\nHome Insurance\nIf you have a mortgage then you are required by your mortgage lender to take out buildings insurance. You may apply online through moneyextra.com for competitively priced buildings and contents insurance and be covered straight away. We search through many of the UK's top insurance companies to find you a selection of the cheapest building insurance, home insurance or home and contents insurance available.\nWhether you are looking to buy house insurance, buildings insurance or maybe both, you will firstly need to give us some information. Just fill in the online enquiry form in as much detail as possible. If you want household insurance you will need to know the value of the contents of your house before we can give you a home contents insurance quote. Or for buildings insurance, you will need to know the rebuild cost of your property. Be as accurate as you can with your information to make sure you get the cover that best suits your needs.\nIt is common sense to take out building insurance when you purchase a property. Buildings insurance is designed to cover damage to the structure of your home as well as damage to permanent fixtures and fittings.\nIn any event, if you're taking out a mortgage, your lender will insist on it as a condition of offering you the mortgage. You will need to know the rebuilding cost of your property so that you may insure for the correct amount. Lenders will usually use the rebuilding cost shown in the valuation report to assess how much buildings insurance is needed, and require that any policy taken out covers at least this amount.\nThe sum insured under a buildings policy must be the full rebuilding cost of the home. Do remember that neither the market value of your home nor the Council Tax band valuation actually has a direct relationship to the rebuilding cost.\nFinancial Advisors FAQ's:\nI live in the area but why should I consider Best Rate Recommended Financial advisors?\nYour Best Rate Recommended Financial Advisor will give you sound impartial financial advice and with the service you would expect from a Professional financial advisor who works in your community.\nHow does your Best rate Recommended Financial advisor service differ from searching on online directories for a financial advisor?\nWe take all the hard work out of searching for a Financial Advisor in your area, if you are looking for someone to provide financial advice this can sometimes be more than a little daunting; with Best Rate Recommended Financial Advisors you can be sure that that our qualified advisors are local, in order to provide you with a service which is both thoroughly professional and accessible.\nHow soon can I expect contact from the Best Rate Recommended Financial Advisor partner?\nAs soon as possible, normally within the same working day.\nWhat areas are they able to advise on?\nFinancial Advisors are able to advise on different areas from Mortgages to pensions, investment advice, through to insurances or retirement planning.

During the summer of 2009, the first phase of a major refurbishment programme was undertaken, which saw half of the buildings of the lower school site transformed, with new windows and doors fitted, in addition to a completely new brick façade, thanks to the installation of the Gebrik insulating brick cladding system.\nThe architects original intention was to simply replace the windows and doors to improve the thermal performance of the building; however once Gebrik had been proposed he realised it would provide the perfect solution to improve the entire fabric of the building, whilst maintaining a robust natural brick finish in keeping with the local vernacula\nFixed directly to the original brick substrate, the Gebrik system delivered an immediate aesthetic transformation, bringing new life to tired buildings, and reducing the U-value by almost 50% to 0.267W/m²K.\nthe building; however once Gebrik had been proposed he realised it \n \n \nwould provide the perfect solutionto improve the entire fabric of the building, whilst maintaining a robust natural brick finishin keepingwith the local vernacula Fixed directly tothe original brick substrate, the Gebrik system delivered an immediate aesthetic transformation, bringing new life to tired buildings, and reducing the U-value by almost 50% to 0.267W/m²K.\nThis created an improved working environment for the staff and pupils, an improved carbon footprint for each of the buildings, with the inherent reduction in fuel bills, and none of the problems associated with traditional brickwork, such as speed of construction, weather dependency and site conditions.\nUsing Gebrik, the whole cladding refurbishment programme was completed in just twelve weeks and remained on track despite a particularly wet summer and poor site conditions.\nWith the vast majority of the work undertaken during the summer holiday, work during term time was limited to just two weeks either side of the recess, ensuring that any disruption to normal school activities was kept to an absolute minimum.\n \n \n \nProject Details\nClient: Trinity Catholic School\nArchitect: The David Rackham Parnership\nMain Contractor: Morgan Sindell\nSlip Finish: FE81-40\nInstallation: ECL Contracts Ltd\n \n \nLast modified on Thursday, 28 March 2013 15:12\nImage Gallery\n{gallery}15{/gallery}"],

Tom Fletcher of McFly fame has no qualms about admitting that he's got a bit of an emotional side when it comes to the language of love...\nThe boyband member happily admitted that he blubbed his way through his marriage to childhood sweetheart, Giovanna Falcone.talking about his special day, the singer said he struggled to hold back the tears when he saw his blushing bride walking down the aisle. He said: 'I just lost it; I’m such a crier!'\n'We both cried during the proposal, I had a lump in my throat but I just about managed to get through it.'\nTom, 26, and his bride, Giovanna, 27, tied the knot at One Marylebone, a fancy Grade I listed former church, on May 12 as their friends and family looked on.\nAlthough an intimate event, the lovebirds wedding day wasn’t short of famous faces. Guests included TOWIE star Mario Falcone - who is Giovanna's brother - and his girlfriend Lucy Mecklenburgh, Fearne Cotton and Busted star Matt Willis with his wife Emma. Former EastEnders star Kara Tointon was a bridesmaid too.\nOf course the McFly boys, Harry and Danny acted jointly as Tom's best men and apparently delivered an amazing speech at the reception, telling all of Toms embarrassing secrets and antics from their early days in Mcfly, much to the delight of guests!\nHowever, they ended the speech with a truly lovely set of words.\n‘When people talk about childhood sweethearts, Tom and Gi are the genuine article,' Harry said.\n‘We’d like to finish off by saying that you two bring out the best in each other,' Danny added.\n'People say that opposites attract but you disprove that. You really are the best of mates and that’s why we know that this true love story will last forever.’\nAh, cute!\nBy Emily Stockham\nTweet\nReaders Comments\nComments\n \nNotify me of followup comments via e-mail\nAbout Us | Contact Us | Accessibiliy | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy | Help | Site Map | Resources\n© 2012 Bauer London Lifestyle.

While the brake pads listed here may fit your bike, please check with bike's manual for part compatibility before commiting to buy.\nThe brake pad is one of the most important components in your braking system; it is the part directly responsible for stopping your bike. By design, brake pads are not built to last. Brake pads are soft (from an industrial standpoint), so that they don't erode the rotor when in use. Instead, the friction wears away at the brake pad, which is an easily replaceable part and must be periodically replaced. When using your bike with worn pads then your bike will be braking under metal-on-metal friction which can warp your rotor, damage your brake system and necesitate unnecessary and expensive repairs.\nThis listing is for a Goldfren sintered front/rear brake pad set for a BMW R 1200 C (Cast Wheel/ABS) (96-02). The EBC reference numbers for the pads included in this set are FA407 front-left pads\nFA407 front-right pads\nFA363 rear pads\nThese pads are a direct replacement for your existing brake pads. The images in the gallery above show you the exact pads you will receive. While we aim to ensure that the fitment information in this listing is as accurate as possible, it is nevertheless advisable to visually check the images in the listing against the pads that are currently on your bike. GOLDfren sintered brake pads\nAll GOLDfren brake pads are made with sintered metal-ceramic and ceramic-carbon friction materials. Sintered brake pads are a modern technology that provides superior stopping power and longer life compared to other brake pad types (such as carbon-organic, organic, or semi-metallic organic). Designed for both wet and dry applications, sintered pads offer no brake fade when operating at high temperatures and in wet conditions, deliver exceptional braking performance under the most demanding conditions. All materials in sintered pads are lead and asbestos free. Sintered GOLDfren pads feature Metal-ceramic, typical iron friction material designed for both dry and wet friction\nHigh static friction coefficient\nHigh braking power to 500°C\nVery good binding strength between copper lined steel base plate and friction layer\nWearing 20% lower when compared to similar competing sintered pads\nLow abrasive interaction with the brake rotor material\nUp to three times longer operational life compared to organic and Kevlar composite materials\nThe characteristic material-specific parameters used in AD GOLDfren pads are Specific pressure: P < 5.0 Mpa\nSliding speed: V < 40 m/s\nConstant maximum temperature: 450°C\nShort time maximum temperature: 700°C\nAD GOLDfren pads are optimal for common street riding on scooters, cruisers and street bikes as both front and rear pads. They are recommended for riders that do not ride too hard, but want good stopping power when required. The wearing rate of this compound is 20% lower than other known sintered brake pads in the same category. The AD compound provides low abrasive interaction with the brake rotor and a much quieter braking due to the composite material. Friction materials contain metal-ceramic and typical iron and finer additives are added to the base of the iron compound to achieve optimal friction properties. About GOLDfren\nGOLDfren are a Czech-based company, and began making sintered disc brake pads in 1991. It has since broadened its line to include products for small aircraft, industrial, automotive, mountain bike, and on- and off-road powersports applications.

But what about your blind spot? When you indicate that you're about to change lanes, our Side Scan lane change assistant warns you about approaching traffic which could pose a danger.\nIf there are cars coming up from behind - closer than 50 metres - or in your blind spot, warning LED lights will flash in your wing mirrors to alert you. In this way you know exactly what is happening around you and can avoid any danger.\nThe system is designed to alert you only when necessary: stationary objects or oncoming vehicles do not trigger warnings. It also ignores vehicles which are more than one lane across, so you're not distracted with frequent warnings. Side scan is activated by pushing a button. It only works from speeds above 40 mph and is primarily designed for motorway driving. You can also switch off the system yourself.\nSo, you'll still want to be careful when changing lanes, but Side Assist gives you valuable extra help to make every long journey a little more comfortable.\nLane Change Assistant Side Assist\nMakes changing lanes safer by monitoring 'blind' spots and warning you of overtaking traffic.\nEuro NCAP\nProvides consumers with an independent assessment of the safety performance of cars sold in Europe.\nGo to Mobile site\nApps\nFAQs\nContact us\nSite map\nHelp\nCookie policy\nLegal policy\n© Volkswagen 2013\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nFlickr"],

        "content_text":["Adam Smith's Lost Legacy: Adam Smith on Bargaining\nAdam Smith's Lost Legacy\nGavinK9 AT gmail DOT com\nSunday, September 25, 2011\nAdam Smith on Bargaining\n[I am in France for a couple of weeks closing our house for the winter, and found on my Mac book a piece I was writing in the summer. I cannot recollect whether I posted it on Lost Legacy – a scroll back was inconclusive. Readers may remember that we left in a great hurry because of an emergency with a daughter’s pregnancy (Florence and baby Alexander are doing fine – the boy is now a healthy 8lbs 13oz; his mother is joyful and tired)].\nHowever, here is the un-posted piece:\n“The famous and frequently quoted passage of ‘the butcher, the brewer, and the baker’ (WN I.ii.2, pp 26-7) as a dominating force in exchange, together with the well-known passages about the invisible hand, have given rise to a too narrow and biased perception of Smith’s thought within neoclassical economics, either distorting or simply ignoring his moral views” (Montes, 2004, 56).\nLeonidas Montes is on the right track here and if we unpack his paragraph we can see why.\nThere is no doubt that this paragraph is both a “famous and frequently quoted” passage, though in truth I would add that it is as frequently misunderstood as it is quoted. In fact, I would go so far as to assert that I have only found one reference to an accurate, and thereby promising, account of what Adam Smith was actually saying in this passage, and that this gem came from an unpromising and unpretentious 19th-century source:\n“It has been customary to describe Political Economy as the dismal science , as the gospel of selfishness. In the hand of Ricardo and his disciples, Political Economy was certainly gloomy enough, and its gospel forbidding; but Smith’s conception of economic science as it did the co-operative and sympathetic side of life, was eminently hopeful and enervating. His view of the industrial order was wide enough to give full play to that subtle psychological chemistry by which egoism is transmuted into altruism. In Smith’s word: ‘In civilised society man stands at all times in need of the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes, while is whole life is scarce sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons.’ In such a state, as Smith goes on to show, man can most satisfactorily connect himself to his fellows through the medium of the reciprocity of services – a process which invests self-interest with a social and ethical quality. From this social and ethical germ develops all the higher virtues of civilisation.” (Macpherson, H.C. 1899. Adam Smith. Famous Scots Series, Oliphant Anderson & Ferrier, Edinburgh).\nThe ‘butcher, brewer, and baker’ passage in Wealth Of Nations says exactly the reverse meaning to that which is commonly attributed to it by most modern economists (we cannot blame them alone because that is what they were taught by their tutors, themselves taught by their tutors – none of them bothering to read the passage carefully enough).\nYes, it is about self-interest; however, it is not about approaching the acquisition of your dinner, or of supplying it, solely dominated by consideration for one’s own self-interest. Far from it! The passage Wealth Of Nation, Book I, chapter 2, p 26-7) specifically states that one should not appeal to one’s own self-interest in attempting to conclude a bargain with the ‘butcher, brewer, and baker’, or anybody else for that matter, but we must address the self-interest of the other party.\nHe has already defined the nature of a bargain a few lines before the famous passage: ‘Give me this that I want, and you shall have this that you want’. This is the conditional proposition in the form: 'If you give me this, I shall give you that' (If-THEN).\nBargaining is an exchange, not something for nothing. To get some of what we want from someone, we have to give them some of what they want in exchange. The amounts that are exchanged are variable (negotiable). Moreover, we must address their self-interests (self-love), and definitely not only ours. The self-interested egoist is more likely to be disappointed and deservedly so.\nNegotiation exchanges between to self-interested egoists are likely to end in deadlock, but negotiated exchanges between self-interested persons who are also other-regarding, which is the essence of Smith’s advice to those seeking the contents of their dinner from others, are likely to be rewarded.\nWhy readers of Adam Smith's Wealth Of Nations and his Moral Sentiments cannot get that right is itself a mystery, as I regularly found in many years taking of literally thousands of managers through negotiation courses at the Edinburgh Business School.Labels: Adam Smith on Bargaining\nposted by Gavin Kennedy at 2:50 pm\n0 Comments:\nPost a Comment\n<< Home\nAbout Me\nName: Gavin Kennedy\nLocation: Edinburgh, United Kingdom\nView my complete profile\nPrevious Posts\nEn Route to France\nBook Review of Robert H.

Unfortunately - those days are long gone, the manual should now address new issues and phpBB3 features\nso! welcome to the national TRAFFIC forums manual for 2009\n† the first part is an INFORMATION section †\nit is designed very clearly to set out to all members and guests that this site is purely unofficial etc\nAФ the second part is a NEWBIES ADVICE section AФ\nthe four lines that comprise this part simply point to a brilliant video for people who don't know nowt about forums at all\nQuestion Answer Section\n= = w e l c o m e = = i n t r o = = = s t a r t = = = = = = n a t i o n a l T r a f f i c = = = = = .\nis this site owned by the Highways Agency? no †\nis this site endorsed by the Highways Agency? no .\nis this site approved by the Highways Agency? no .\nis this site an official site? no .\nso it's not owned by the Highways Agency, it's not endorsed by the Highways Agency, it's not approved by the Highways Agency and it's not an official site? hey you're getting the hang of this - correct, correct, correct and CORRECT! .\nthe members who post on here, are they speaking on behalf of the Highways Agency? no .\nwhat about the information displayed on here, is that official information? no .\nis that information endorsed by the Highways Agency? no .\nis that information approved by the Highways Agency? no .\nso the members are not speaking on behalf of the Highways Agency and the information shown is not official and is not endorsed OR approved by the Highways Agency correct correct and CORRECT .\nthe members who post on this site, are they just posting messages expressing their own personal opinions and views? yes they are just saying what they think in their private capacity only .\nbut they are Traffic Officers aren't they? you will find that some members are Traffic Officers certainly .\nand the Traffic Officer members are speaking on behalf of the Highways Agency? no just in their private individual capacity only .\nwhat's the point of coming on here then? it's your choice, you are free to choose to visit any site on the internet you like .\nwhy HAVE a site for Traffic Officers that is not approved not endorsed and is completely unofficial? well there are some people who actually prefer to join a community that is totally free of influence from their employer .\na community? yes these forums are in internet terms a community .\nwell I think I'll have a look around please do - have a look around and see what you think .\n= = w e l c o m e = = i n t r o = = = e n d = = = = = = n a t i o n a l T r a f f i c = = = = = = .\nI'm a newbie WELCOME newbie! AФ\nI haven't a clue!! Is there a guide? YES JUST CLICK HERE!! (allow 30 seconds - please WAIT!) .\nthat was great!! what can I do to help? tell other newbies about it!! .\nokay I will! THANKS! .\nwhat does \"registered member\" and \"official member\" mean? I have seen these various titles and stars but don't understand them these various titles are gained as members stack up more and more posts during their involvement on the site\nclick here for more info A\nI quite like the forums - is there anything I should do to make sure everything runs smoothly? Yes, you should write down the email address that you supplied at the time of joining AND your password - keep them safe somewhere, perhaps in a WORD.DOC or in your favourite diary. If you forget your password - there is a back up system to help* but this RELIES on you knowing the exact email address that you registered with B\nwhat if I do forget which email address that I registered with or the email account gets closed? what and then you forget your password too? .\nyeah I would be stuffed too true matie .\nwhat's the solution? keep a note of your password and email address that you registered with .\nfine but that gets lost too okay in that case you should notify an administrator or moderator .\nhow can I contact an administrator or moderator? please click here for THE CONTACT PAGE .\nis it worth it? or should I just start a new account? see if site staff can help you, please allow a few days, if not then you will have to start a new account .\nI made a heck of a lot of posts yes and if we can possibly get your account going for you - we will, it may take time so please be patient .\nI can't wait, I'm opening a new account anyway okay, that's fine .\nis there no other way? not really, please keep your password safe and ensure you know which email address you provided to us when you registered .\nthanks! no worries pally!! here to help .\nshould I use my REAL NAME? it is recommended that you use a fictional name e.g. 'van Helsing' or 'Dracula' .\nI decided that I want to change my username You can change your username by PMing any administrator: lieutenant fatman, TheWanderer or falkor .\nI saw a great thread on HATOs getting HANDCUFFS, but now I can't find it again I really enjoyed that thread Did you try pressing \"search\" and entering \"handcuffs\" ? C\nYes - I found so many similar threads to that, but not the exact one that I had found before, how do I get BACK to that exact thread? this is a nightmare If you are a registered user scroll down down down to the bottom of your favourite thread, see there \"Subscribe Topic\" and \"Bookmark Topic\" ? Click \"Subscribe Topic\" to turn on the \"watch\" facility for your favourite threads in the forum. From now on you'll get an email every time somebody replies to it! .\nAnything else? Yep there's the \"Bookmark Topic\" system .\nwhat is the bookmarks system? you click \"Bookmark Topic\" to a topic you wish to bookmark, then at anytime you can go to your bookmarks list [RECOMMENDED] .\nbut HOW? click on UCP, select \"Manage Bookmarks\" there is your list of bookmarked topics! .\nI noticed that my member no. does not display in my posts if your member no. is \"too high\" it will not display D\nbut I want it to display alongside my posts well there is nothing you can do about it really. you could try changing to a different template, each template may have a slightly different \"threshold\" .\nwill the threshold be changed? no, I'm afraid it won't .\nwhy not? changing individual template thresholds is quite a chore, so that's why they're all slightly different .\nwhat's the main threshold? it's set at approxamitely 6300 in prosilver .\nHow do I add an image in one of my posts? phpBB BBCode incorporates a tag for including images in your posts. Two very important things to remember when using this tag are: many users do not appreciate lots of images being shown in posts and second, the image you display must already be available on the Internet (it cannot exist only on your computer, for example, unless you run a webserver!). There is currently no way of storing images locally with phpBB. To display an image, you must surround the URL pointing to the image with tags.\nFor example: Code: Select all\n[img]www.yah.com/logo.gif[/img]\nmore info on codes e.g. \"img\" E\nGREAT - I've got a huge close up of my face 900 x 900, wait up I'll get it in my thread right now woah boy woah!! the maximum width for posted images is 659 and quite honestly if you stick to 595 wide this would be appreciated .\nwhat about my 900 x 900 close up, right up my nostrils you can see I bet you can too, well get photoshop or some other drawing/ photo accessory and reduce the image width to 659 .\nactually it's not my image, it's held on another server ok you can make a request for the image to be reduced, try PMing falkor .\nI am really enjoying being a member on this site now, is there anything that I can do to help the site? Yep, there sure is, please print off the front page of the site. Please post it up on a noticeboard at your place of work, or give it to people you think might be interested in the site. F\nok, is there anything ELSE I can do to help? yes there is, as you have a look around the site you may find certain things in the forum that do not work properly, for instance, you may click a link and find that a white page displays telling you that \"the page cannot be displayed\" or \"page not found\" .\nyes I found that one of the links on the main site just didn't work, it led nowhere PLEASE help the site by reporting such issues straight away - all you need to do is email falkor, this really would help! .\nI saw comments from a new member that make my blood boil! he was slagging off another T.O. and is obviously anti-HATO Supervisors on the site have powers to deal with such bad behaviour, please check the\n> Supervisor HOT LINE < G\nis there an easier way to report a bad post? yes, look carefully at the top edge of the post that you wish to report. Look for a small icon, an upside down triangle with an exclamation mark. It should be alongside another small icons with \"QUOTE\" inside it. Click the exclamation icon and you will find it turns into a REPORTING SYSTEM .\nwill the person who made the \"bad post\" find out that I reported it? No. Your identity will be displayed to moderators only, nobody else .\nI saw a thread about whether HATOs should be allowed to carry asps or truncheons off duty and it seems obvious to me that a poll should go on the topic but there is no poll there, it's just such a shame! the author of the thread (or any supervisor) can enstall a poll into the thread by pressing EDIT in the very first POST in the thread and then looking down below the message body where poll functions will be found H\nA post I just made was DELETED and I don't know why! If your post consisted of just a smilie or just a couple of words it may have been deemed too short a message to be allowed .\nNo it was a long message with plenty of content was it a reply to a post you just made on the thread? .\nYes, I made one post - then 5 minutes later decided to clarify it with more info that is double posting and is frowned on on this site .\nwhy's that? if you need to add further info in a post you just made - please press EDIT in that post, your further info will be added .\nsomebody replied to my post though well in that case you do not need to use EDIT, you can make whatever reply you like .\nso double posting - the 2nd post will be deleted? it may be. there are exceptions, for instance one member is compiling a weekly poem topic, he is allowed to double post because there is a definite system going there and everybody can see it's necessary .\nI saw a member who clocked up loads of posts - all of a sudden he was BANNED!! I am shocked - what on earth did he do? very often the reason a member gets banned is evident in one of the threads that he posted in. if you are really curious to find out try going to the banned member's profile and selecting find all posts by this member I\nit brings up over a hundred posts! well you said you wanted to know why they were banned, you may find that the recent posts reveal the answer .\nno I checked the recent posts, they seem fairly civilised in every case that a member is banned an explanation is given on one of the threads that that member posted on but to cut a long story short - in most cases the banned member is allowed to reapply for reinstatement to the forums after 7 days .\nand then ? IF the person applies for reinstatement, then the supervisors will consider the matter carefully .\nhow many people have been banned from this site? this information is not available but to see the current ban list click here .\nI want to email or PM a banned member please do not ask for help doing this .\nso why WOULD a member be banned? mainly because the person concerned has behaved contrary to behaviour expected or has been previously warned for contravening forum rules and has gone on to repeat the same behaviour again .\nsuch a person would be banned? Yes, this site is for Traffic Officers or members who have the HATO cause at heart and who are able to discuss issues in a civilised manner .\nthey are not allowed to argue or criticise? yes they are, as long as it is constructive and done so in a manner that ends in a smile, but a person who relentlessly criticises or argues to kingdom come or who just cannot abide by our code of behaviour is not really welcome on here .\nwhat the heck are USERGROUPS? click on UCP (User Control Panel) in your top menu .\nOK You will find that usergroups are slotted in amongst several other user friendly tabs for you .\nWhat's the point of them? Very often each user group will have their own private forum, the usergroups acts as a 'padlock and key,' for instance in \"white light\" they are the original members of the site and they talk about the old days, but new members cannot participate .\nI want to join 'white light' and read about the old days Sorry you can't but what about joining PJIRC? Join that group!! .\nthen I can see loads of chat about the chat room? No, that group does not have it's own forum but can receive bulletuns on special chat nights. the usergroups are particularly good at enabling BULK EMAILS to all the members in that group\nproviding automatic access to a private area of the site\n.\nI joined PJIRC but now I'm fed up getting all the BULK EMAILS on chat nights, I really am not interested in that and wish to leave the group OK but remember, if you leave the group you will stop receiving BULK EMAILS to all the members in that group\nbe unable to access the private area of the site (if there is one for that group)\n.\nI don't care, I want to leave the group are you sure? .\nYEP, how do I leave? You may not be permitted to do so, but to determine this - you may attempt this procedure > > [NOT RECOMMENDED] .\nso how would I attempt this procedure? I am determined select user control panel (U C P)\nlook for the tab that says \"USERGROUPS\"\nselect it\nvarious usergroups details will now be presented to you, categorised by 'memberships' and 'non-memberships'\nnote the far right column headed \"SELECT\"\nthis column allows you to choose \"LEAVE\" in the 'memberships' category, OR \"JOIN\" in the 'non-membership' category\nWARNING - LEAVING a usergroup cannot be \"undone\" - it may be better to seek advice from a moderator, before choosing this action\nselecting \"LEAVE\" or \"JOIN\" against certain usergroups may be ignored - depending on the way the group is organised, e.g. in the case of \"Registered Users\" you are not permitted \"to LEAVE\"\nto LEAVE a group where permitted, click SELECT in the far right column level with the group name\nnow select \"RESIGN\" in the drop down menu at the bottom of the column\nclick SUBMIT\n.\nokay I successfully removed myself from the PJIRC group it is most unlikely that you would be rejoined to the PJIRC usergroup by a PJIRC leader or a mod .\nokay what about leaving other usergroups? the fact is that many members are joined to usergroups by the checking of criteria .\nwhat criteria? various criteria are considered, but if you fit within it then you could quite easily be joined to a usergroup by a leader or mod, who is unaware that you just left the group .\nI want to make sure that I do not get joined to a usergroup all you can do is attempt to leave the group or request the leader, or a mod to remove you from it .\nSo the Usergroups act like a \"padlock and key\" to private areas on the site? Yes they do, you should not reveal your password to anybody else .\nWhy not? Because then you are compromising that usergroup .\nI don't care - I want my mate to see what the usergroup is saying in the private forum There are various facilities available to the administrators of the site to detect such abuse, you are liable to lose your membership of the group if you allow other members to use your password .\nFair enough . .\nI have had enough of the forums now I want to resign ok, sorry to hear you say that - please come back some time later - your account will still be here waiting for you J\nNo I want you to delete my account Accounts can be deleted if the member has written 0 posts or has joined solely to advertise a website .\nI have written 59 posts, please delete my account and the 59 posts No, this will not be completed by support staff of the site .\nI will do it then Yes you can press 'edit' in all of the 59 posts and delete them one by one that way .\nOK I will do that There are facilities open to the administrator to restore back all those posts after you \"delete them\" .\nWhy should you do that? We probably wouldn't bother but we do reserve the right to apply such facilities .\nOK I am now going to delete all of my posts Fine - I can't stop you. Your account will be suspended when this is discovered and consideration given as to whether you should be banned from the site .\nWhy? That's not fair You just said you wanted to resign from the forums. Deleting all your posts is going one stage further. It is sabotaging the basic communications of this site .\nYou just told me I could do it Because you physically can do it, does not mean that such action is approved .\nOK . .\nI am aged 13 and I am interested in becoming a Traffic Officer when I leave school That's great but please note: our forums are intended for use by persons aged 16 years and above. Persons under that age may read the topics displayed but may not participate otherwise K\nwhen was this decided? this was decided on 14.1.09 .\nwhy was this decision made? most importantly, persons under the age of 16 may be vulnerable to private contact from another member of the site. It is important to remove the ability for under-age users to communicate \"privately\" with other users via this site .\nwhat if a member under the age of 16 opens an account? this must be reported immediately to any moderator .\nI keep on getting private messages from another member, they are not abusive but rather annoying, he keeps on at me to visit his website, I went to it once and it's as boring as hell, he keeps PMing me and I'm sick of it Private Messaging can be DISABLED on a per member basis. If a complaint is made, the spammer can be warned that his private messaging will be disabled by the administrator of the site: COPY the private messages into a PM or email to an administrator of the site, with your complaint .\nI have noticed that other members have little pictures under their member names, how do I get a little picture like that? Should you wish to choose an avatar - you might want to see what other members have chosen first, have a look around on the forums and please try and pick an avatar that has not been used by another member\n.... now select \"U C P\" from the top menu. go to your tabbed options and select \"Profile\" now look for \"Edit avatar\" in the side options\nnow click 'BROWSE' to choose an image from your own computer OR click 'Display gallery' [RECOMMENDED] to find a library image (this is the easy way) .\nI saw The Wanderer's faq page all about Traffic Officers' kit and training, IT'S GREAT! Yes articles like that form the best part of the main site .\nA pal of mine took some photos of me on my motorway patrol and me talking to the services personnel and even some of the yobs where I patrol, I could do an article like that absolutely - submit the photos and your text so that the article can be finalised on the main site L\nbut who do I email with the photos /text? > please check the CONTACT US page for email addresses < - please write down the email address that you want to reply to from there .\nwhich email address do I use? use the first one, if there is no response go to the second one etc. .\nif the forums crash we go to http://www.prisonofficer.org.uk/hBB3/ M\nany other back up? no sir .\nTHEY are the back up forums? YES, that is the back up forums .\nWhy bother? well it's possible that the live forums could drop out, that's all .\nif the forums have crashed it is unlikely that the forums will be visible to display the back up forum address so - how will we know the address of the back up site? You won't .\nso if we don't KNOW the address of the back up site after a forum crash, how do we know where to go? hey I just thought of something, why not make a note NOW of the back up forum address? .\nwhat and then if the forums are wasted by some crazy hacker or through some colossal crash - we can go straight to the back up forums? radical .\nare the back up forums run by the same host as the main forums? I know what you're thinking! The answer is yes, but on a way different server, so that's something at least .\nhave the back up forums ever had to be used? no not yet .\nI can't find the chat room this may be due to the fact that you're not logged in N\nWhy should it make any difference? our chat room is only available to people who are logged in .\nWhy is the chat room only available to those logged in? we don't want guests in there .\nWhy not? because under the cloak of a \"guest\" anything stupid daft or offensive could be said, we don't need that .\nokay I'm logged in, I still can't find the chat room sorry about that CLICK HERE did it launch? .\neerrr yep I found the chat room now thanks and? .\nI've got problems sorry about that, go to this topic tons of info there .\nhow do I let people know I'm in the chat room on the thread .\nwhere? we actually have a specific topic called \"in chat now!\" .\nwhere? here > try it out and add a comment yourself ! .\ncan I help in some way? you sure can .\nhow? join the CHAT ROOM GROUP .\nhow? click on here !! .\nokay I joined the group! good, now start a thread or FIND a thread on PJIRC and add a reply .\nwhat shall I say? anything, just say you like the chat room, that'll be enough .\nanything else I should be aware of? how do I know I'm in the right chat room? check this topic to clarify that .\nI saw a member has a 'star award' yes some members do have a 'star award' O\nwell I'm a great member, I should have one too Yes and if you involve yourself on the site long enough, you will in due course get one too, believe me .\nWhere can I view further information on this? no further info yet .\nMy topic was deleted! When you registered you agreed that \"the webmaster, administrator and moderators of this forum have the right to remove, edit, move or close any topic at any time should they see fit,\" so that would include deleting your topic P\nbut I was not even informed! ah, sorry about that, please advise me of what the topic no. was .\nwhat the heck is the topic no? look at the very top of this page, you will see text beginning Code: Select all\nhttp://national-pcsos.co.uk/h2phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=6\nafter the php?f=2&t= you will see the topic no. .\nI don't know what the topic no. is now, it's been deleted! ah, well without the topic no. it's very hard to find out what happened BUT tell me the topic title and I will check with mods to try and find out what happened .\nMy topic was LOCKED! When you registered you agreed that \"the webmaster, administrator and moderators of this forum have the right to remove, edit, move or close any topic at any time should they see fit,\" so that would include locking your topic .\nbut why was it locked?! well sometimes a topic is locked instead of deleting it .\nhow's that?! the topic may contain both positive AND negative elements. Locking the topic just allows it to \"fade away.\" The topic is still there for all to read, but soon it will drop to the bottom of the forums and away from most members' attention .\njust delete it and have done with it no, the topic although justifying a lock does not justify removal .\ncan a different mod unlock the topic? yes .\nI posted a perfectly good thread but then the next day found somebody had tampered with my title what was your title? Q\nSucess and it was changed to ? .\nSucess [when the name calling starts] Yes your thread was perfectly ok but a supervisor thought that your title was just too short or too vague .\nthe part in square brackets was added by a supervisor? yes .\nI hate the look of the square brackets, can you take them off please? no but you can! if you wish, just press edit in your first post and remove the square brackets, that will be fine .\nI'll remove the whole additional title as well no don't do that, the title is too short or too vague - we need good descriptive titles for our topics please .\nok, fair enough . .\nI went to read a topic and a message was displayed \"This topic does not exist\" Sorry, it must have been deleted, try another topic .\nI have heard that we can choose our own background colour in the forums, we can have black, light blue, dark blue, brown, red, pink - we can choose whatever we want Well there are a number of templates to choose from yes .\nHow do I try these out? Go to U C P (User Control Panel) and then \"Board preferences\" then look for \"My board style\"\nSelect a different template name and then press SUBMIT at the bottom of the page .\nAre there any side effects from doing this? well the lesser known templates incorporate less of the features that are common on the best known templates ..... .\nwhat does that mean? you may find functions present on a well known template like \"prosilver\" that are quite simply missing from obscure templates like \"king_conan\" sorry about that, if you miss the \"function\" so much, then simply pick another template .\nI just go back to the \"Board Preferences\" page again? Yes you can set many personal attributes there .\nwhich is the best \"board style\" ? There are two topics on this\nthe 2009 templates\nthe 2008 templates\nthese topics describe all the available templates .\nI saw that one member has a wide flashing lights image banner in their signature yes members are allowed images a maximum of 35 high and 555 wide in their signatures R\nI would like one too okay but please keep to the maximum dimensions .\nwhy are there restrictions on images in signatures? images are not encouraged for signatures at all really .\nwhy not? the reason is - is that they are then repeated again and again and we already have images repeated again and again, in the form of avatars, so that's the reason why .\nI have seen a photo in a thread - I need to copy that photo to a thread that I'm posting in, how do I do it? firstly there is an image restriction of 659 wide\nso long as the image is below 659 wide you are allowed to do the image copy .\nbut how? this is a demo to show you how to copy your avatar into a post\nright click on your avatar\nchoose properties (normally at the bottom of the options list)\nlook at DIMENSIONS\nthis shows 2 numbers e.g 279 x 124\nthe first number is the width\nit is less than 659 so it is allowed\nnow look at ADDRESS\ncopy the ADDRESS onto paper by writing it down\nnow EDIT your post pressing the EDIT button in your post OR write a new reply\nwrite the ADDRESS into your existing post or into your new reply\nsurround the ADDRESS with img tags e.g Code: Select all\n[img]www.yah.com/monroe.gif[/img]\nnow press preview to see if the tags worked\nif it didn't work recheck your code, there is probably a space where there shouldn't be one or you forgot the closing img tag must have a /\nonce you see it works press SUBMIT\n.\ncan I read more about img tags? yes there is more on img tags and in fact there are more tags available than just img ones\n> please click here for further on img and even more tags < .\nI saw one member writing in different coloured ink, how do I do that? writing in different coloured fonts is NOT RECOMMENDED because this forum allows 18 different background colours, if you leave the forum to write in the default font colour, everybody will be able to read what you're saying, no matter what background colour (template) another member has chosen S\nI saw one post written in large lettering and it had a photo in it, how do I do that? why not 'take a peek' at the code that that member used to put his post together? .\nYes I would like to do that, how do I peek into the code that made another member's post? is that possible? yes it is, but follow these instructions closely\npeeking into another member's code using QUOTE look at the post that you wish to examine closely\nnow press QUOTE in that post\nnow the code that that member used to put that post together is presented to you for examination\nif you know how to use copy and paste then copy and paste that code to word or notepad\nnow press your BACK BUTTON in the top left of your computer screen to exit\n.\nwhat is this \"copy and paste\" ? > check here for a tutorial on copy and paste < T\nerr I didn't press my BACK BUTTON to exit, I made a mistake and pressed SUBMIT, now what do I do? you plonker you were only supposed to peek at a member's code, not make a reply - ok never mind .\ncan I delete that reply? it was a mistake look in the reply that you made, is there a little icon X in the top right of your post? (next to \"EDIT\") .\nyes I see the X are you sure you want to delete your post? .\nyes I should have pressed BACK BUTTON, my mistake ok click the X - it will delete your post .\nsorry there is no X there, now what do I do? well you cannot delete the post without an X button .\nwell I don't like the post I made, it is just annoying, I made a mistake, surely I can do something? press EDIT in your mistake post and delete everything in the message box, then write a few words like \"entered in error\" or \"MOD: please delete, post made by mistake\" .\nok I'll do that, cheers! . .\nI used QUOTE to quote what another member said. It reproduced their post in mine and then I replied more clearly to what they said yep, QUOTE is pretty good, well done .\nbut I wanted to QUOTE what 2 members said from different posts in the thread so that I can chat directly back to those 2 comments hehe but you can only press one QUOTE button, what a conundrum .\nwhat's a conundrum? the thing is, to get 2 quoted posts into your one reply do this: press QUOTE in the first post that you want reproduced in your reply\nnow don't press SUBMIT yet!\nCOPY AND PASTE the entire contents of the reply box into a word.doc or text.txt page\nnow use your BACK BUTTON to exit from the QUOTE\nnow find the next post that you wish to QUOTE\npress QUOTE in the second post that you want reproduced in your reply\nnow don't press SUBMIT yet\nCOPY AND PASTE the entire contents of the reply box into the word.doc or text.txt page AFTER the one that you already did\nnow use your BACK BUTTON to exit from the QUOTE just like last time\nnow go to the thread in question and simply press REPLY\nnow copy and paste the whole of the text from the word.doc or text.txt page INTO your reply box\n.\nwhat is this \"copy and paste\" ? > check here for a tutorial on copy and paste < U\nThe last post in the topic featured a quoted post, the poster had pressed QUOTE and it showed the post that he then went on to reply to. Great .\nNow when I press QUOTE, I get both his post and the post he quoted, quoted in my post and I can reply to both his post and the post he quoted And then the next poster can press QUOTE again and get both your post quoted plus the previous poster who quoted somebody else .\nYeah then the next poster can press QUOTE again and gets so many quote boxes going we are all sick of the sight of seeing boxes within boxes the site now limits the amount of QUOTE BOXES that are permitted to mount up to prevent causing a total mess in the thread - so don't be surprised if you are stopped from QUOTING more than 3 quotes in succession .\nor it is likely that a whole succession of QUOTED QUOTES will kick off? Yep and the whole page just looks a mess, totally unnecessary too .\nI read on one thread about a 'scum sucking SPAMMER' - what the heck is that? well a person who joins a website solely to advertise a product or another forum or website, is certainly a SPAMMER .\nand SCUM SUCKING SPAMMER? the worst kind of SPAMMER .\nwhat do they do? they are the worst SPAMMER, they join the site solely to advertise a product or another forum or website that bears NO RELATION to the subject matter at the heart of our website! .\nwhat should we do if we see a SPAMMER doing their worst? > notify a supervisor please <\nwhy not use the REPORTING SYSTEM to flag the post? (see section G above) .\nI would like to be a supervisor myself that is great but please be satisfied with being an active and respected member of the forum V\nI really would like to be a supervisor on the forum well the number of supervisors is kept LOW deliberately, this forum does not need many supervisors, but thank you for expressing your interest at this time .\nHow are members expected to behave? May I remind you of one of the terms that you signed to when you joined this site?\n\"You agree not to post any abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, hateful, threatening, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws.

Please do not write in French or any other language than English .\nThis is unfair, I wish to write in French Sorry, if you continue to write in a language other than English, you will be banned .\nI wrote a post then a mod replied on the topic to me headed \"WARNING 1\" you have done something that does not justify banning you, this is 1 warning, please take heed of it .\nThe mod also wrote that I could \"leave the site\" Yes the mod is telling you that you can voluntarily stop coming here .\nThis is very hurtful to me If you wish to stay on the site, you could PM the MOD or ADMIN to make amends .\nI don't agree with this warning there is no appeal process regarding issue of warnings .\nOK how long is a \"Warning\" valid? 12 months .\nCan a member be banned from the site for longer than 7 days? Yes a member can be banned from the site for longer than 7 days. These are the circumstances in which that would apply\nAny member who - repeatedly contravenes \"How members are expected to behave\" OR\nwhile banned from the site for 7 days, opens a further account on the site or uses a previously opened account on the site OR\nembarks on a campaign of manually going through all their posts one by one and deleting each one OR\nwhile banned from the site for 7 days, is the subject of a moderators decision where 2 or more moderators decide the ban will be increased from 7 days to indefinite OR\nis the subject of a moderators decision where 2 or more moderators decide the ban will be indefinite\nwill be banned indefinitely W\nWhat IS the * back up system to help?

To choose an avatar - you might want to see what other members have chosen first, so have a look around the forums\nthat will show you all the avatars that have already been chosen, but it may take a few minutes\nthen .............. once you have seen the avatars already chosen by other people .... now select \"U C P\" (User Control Panel) from the top menu.\ngo - \"PROFILE\" then choose \"Edit avatar\" then click \"Display Gallery\" just above the word \"Submit\" at the very bottom of the page.\nSelect \"Display gallery\" and once you have chosen a piccie - remember to press \"Submit\" at the bottom of the form or nothing will happen. .\nNah I decided I really want to upload my own avatar Okay - if you are sure, be warned this can be time consuming and arduous, but if you are determined .\nI am determined Okay the restrictions on uploaded avatars are less than 16k in file size\nno indecent, crude, offensive or insulting material\nstatic (no moving parts!)\nwidth must be less than 115\nyou are prepared to remove the avatar if requested by any moderator who disagrees with your choice\nif you comply with those 5 restrictions then go ahead! .\nI just saw a newbie come on the site with a question that has been asked a million times before\nblow me, they have started a NEW TOPIC\non something that has been asked over and over before have a look on the applications forum - is it covered in there? see if you can spot a previous question on there and note the thread title no Y\nok there IS a previous thread, now what? quote the previous thread title and advise the newbie how to get to the thread Code: Select all\nhttp://national-pcsos.co.uk/h2phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=24 \nthat would be really helpful .\nthanks for reading > if you want to see the old 2007 manual then click here\nLast edited by falkor on Mon May 04, 2009 6:25 pm, edited 4 times in total.\nReason: update from '2007 manual' to '2009 manual'\nRe: nationalTRAFFIC forums manual for 2007/8\nThu Sep 11, 2008 8:35 am\nNighthawk\nElite Legion\nMember No: 495\nPosts: 1984\nLocation: Dark Side Of The Moon!\nStyle: prosilver\nClass: 'Demi-Undead'\nAlignment: 'Thunder'\nSacred: 'Warrior'\nReport this post\nReply with quote\nYea Though I Drive Through The Valley Of The Shadow Of Death, I Fear No Evil.......

With determination and flexibility they can eventually land it though.\nPosted by Rosemary on\n11 August 2013 at 18:14\nHave a vast majority of you knockers considered doing something for your town like getting out pick up litter you or mates might have thrown down,knock on the councils door theres plenty of volunteer work to do,you never know where it might lead.\nPosted by Love your town on\n11 August 2013 at 14:25\n\"He also said a lot of people donÃ¢â¬â¢t know what moving away entails as there isnÃ¢â¬â¢t enough information available to them.\"\nIf only there were some network of computers available which people could use to search for information, there could even be 'engines' created to help people search for information not only from around the country but the whole world.\nPosted by Me on\n10 August 2013 at 21:27\nSo much generalisation from the comments on here! Have you met every person in Workington to know we are narrow minded? I for one left Workington to train as a teacher 17 years ago in a large city and was more than happy to move back. I am proud of where I live, know some amazing people and have a fantastic family all from the town. Workington is what you make it!!\nPosted by SA on\n10 August 2013 at 21:07\nLiterally just got back from Workington ,and we were sat in the car park at Dunelm Mill and we saw a shed load of 'boy racers' eat their Maccy Ds and actually fling their rubbish out of the car window. Absolute disgrace,a disgrace to the town,a disgrace to their upbringing and a disgrace to themselves.Heafty on the spot fines should be imposed fast. My young children could not believe their eyes at such behaviour,as a parent I try hard to teach then right from wrong. With numptys like this running about town it's not a bit of wonder the place is regarded this way. Shameful sign of the 'couldn't give a dam 'times. Generally I love shopping here,the people are always friendly and it's quiet enough to enjoy browsing. It's a shame the ignorant selfish few spoil it.....like everywhere I suppose!\nPosted by Ms Opinion on\n10 August 2013 at 20:03\nWas this piece commissioned by GEN II? University IS the only option, if you want to get any where in the UK today. You even need a degree to work for Enterprise Hire Car!\nPosted by Educating Rita on\n10 August 2013 at 20:01\nWorkington is a real place you can find on a map while \"Lakeland\" (as opposed to Lake District which you can find on a map) is an idealised concept dreamt up by Victorian romantics which is in peoples heads more than it is any particular place. So there is no conclusion to this argument. If someone's romantic concept of \"Lakeland\" includes Workington, then its true for them. But Victorian romanticism doesn't give our youngsters a future, which is what this debate should be about. And you need to sell a hell of a lot of cream teas to make the wages of a skilled worker in one of our leading edge technological industries, which we still have thriving in Workington when in many other places they've gone to the wall. More investment in education training enterprise and skills for our people, young and not so young, is what we need to give them the confidence to aspire, and build on our high-tech, high-skill industrial base to provide secure well-paid jobs. Thats the challenge.\nPosted by Michael Heaslip on\n10 August 2013 at 14:35\nAll this about Workington being part of Lakeland is utter nonsense, Workington is lucky in that it is close in location to this beautiful area, but plays no part in it, neither can I see any tourists wanting to visit the place. Workington like Barrow In Furness is an old industrial town that has seen better days, a very isolated, depressing place with not a lot going for it, I can't see it having much of a future either. The only other thing I can say about it is that it even makes Carlisle looks good and that takes a lot of doing. All of these towns along the Cumbrian Coast from Carlisle downwards let the rest Cumbria down.\nPosted by McWilliam on\n10 August 2013 at 12:49\nI left Workington to move south when I was 19, 11 years ago, I would love to return home. My family live there, houses are cheap and the pace of life is much better. However, sadly I just don't think it is going to happen.\nI often look for jobs in and around Cumbria and usually come up with nothing. When I do find something, it is inevitably a temporary position. You simply can't plan your future around this. Plus public transport is unreliable and expensive.\nWhen I visit my family I am often left depressed by the town. There are few good restaurants with little variety. There are no book/ music shops and there seems to be more pound/ sports clothing shops than anything else. The last few nights I've had out in Workington have been dire (empty pubs) with no atmosphere. The town centre has had millions invested in it, now there needs to be investment in people.\nPosted by Exile on\n10 August 2013 at 12:45\nevery towns the same these days,our goverments to blame,due to non or very little investment.im from Carlisle,and find my towns dwindling in a backwards direction.the goverment would prefer to give away ÃÂ£814m to africa,when our own people struggle having to use food banks.\nPosted by ANDREW AND GEORGE on\n10 August 2013 at 09:24\nPage\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nMake your comment\nYour name\nYour Email\nYour Town/City\nYour comment\nI have read and accepted the website's terms for commenting\nHave your say\nCarlisle school lodges official complaint about Ofsted inspectorsâ impartiality\n(12 comments)\n'Deserters' leaving Carlisle to shop in Glasgow are harming city\n(52 comments)\nCumbrian pub gets go-ahead for longer opening hours\n(21 comments)\nEx-Cumbrian health chief says working across Border 'a breath of fresh air'\n(5 comments)\nBus cuts across Cumbria loom in bid to save Â£1.3m\n(38 comments)\nHospitals smoking ban goes too far, says Carlisle councillor\n(74 comments)\nAllerdale set to back Government proposal to sideline county council in nuclear store search\n(59 comments)\nCumbrian beauty queen overcomes cruel internet bullies\n(11 comments)\nCarlisle dad fined for cycling with daughter on shoulders\n(45 comments)\nCourt & crime\nEstate 'hard man' broke boy's nose in unprovoked attack\nTagged Carlisle man arrested for getting Christmas decorations out of own loft\n'Depraved' Cumbrian man groomed girl, 13, to become prostitute\nWest Cumbrian pensioner admits benefit fraud\nBanged up\nAnne Pickles\nCompetition culture left nurse celebrating âwinâ\nEh?

Picture: Getty\nby GARETH MACKIE\nÂ \nPublished on the\n19\nSeptember\n2013\n00:00\nPublished 19/09/2013 00:00\n2\ncomments\nPrint this\nThe Bank of England has raised its economic growth forecast for the third quarter but said its money-printing programme could resume if the recovery loses steam.\nThe central bankâs monetary policy committee (MPC) also voiced frustration that governor Mark Carneyâs new policy of âforward guidanceâ has been misinterpreted as a trigger for interest rate rises.\nMinutes of the MPC meeting, published yesterday, showed the Bank expects the economy to grow by 0.7 per cent in the third quarter, up from an estimate of 0.5 per cent in last monthâs inflation report.\nPolicymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at the record low of 0.5 per cent, while the nine-member committee was also united in maintaining the Bankâs quantitative easing (QE) programme at Â£375 billion. However, the minutes noted: âWere the recovery to falter, the case for further asset purchases would be stronger.â\nUnder Carneyâs policy, rates will not rise until unemployment, which currently stands at 7.7 per cent, falls to 7 per cent â unless there is a risk of inflation running out of control.\nInstead of being reassured that rates will remain on hold until 2016, the City expects a hike by the middle of 2015, but the MPC stressed that a fall in the jobless level was not âmechanically linkedâ to an increase in borrowing costs.\nOfficial figures on Tuesday showed the consumer prices index dipped to 2.7 per cent last month, from 2.8 per cent in July, and the MPC said a stronger pound meant inflation was âmarginally less likely than a month ago to be above 2.5 per cent in 18 to 24 monthsâ timeâ.\nMORE STORIES\nBill Jamieson: What can the MPC find to talk about?\nComment: US budget stalemate not as bad as it looks\nFisher says lenders and borrowers should be cautious\nBusiness lending falls as FLS fails to hit the mark\nThe week ahead: Supermarkets battle it out\nÂ \nComments\nÂ \nJobs\nDirectory\nProperty\nMotors\nSearch for a job\nKeywords\nLocation\nDistance\nThis area\nThis area +3 miles\nThis area +5 miles\nThis area +10 miles\nThis area +15 miles\nThis area +20 miles\nThis area +30 miles\nThis area +50 miles\nJob Type\nany\nPermanent\nContract/Intern\nTemporary/Seasonal\nPart-Time\nPowered by\nSearch the directory\nSearch For: (Plumber, Taxi, McDonalds...)\nWhere?

Fans of Bring Me The Horizon film vocalist Oli Sykes on their smartphones and cameras\nContinue reading the main story Related Stories\nMusic piracy 'down' as revenues rise\n'Digital is saving, not killing music' Watch\nMusic, TV and digital disruption\nAs fans filed into Webster Hall in New York City last week, a note from indie rock band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs wasted no syllables in laying down the law.\n\"Please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device/camera,\" it said, along with some stronger words unrepeatable here.\nDuring the gig, vocalist Karen O repeated the request, telling fans to take a picture right at that moment - but to then keep devices hidden for the good of those around them.\nOn the web, news of the band's defiance against the march of the amateur filmmaker spread - and was met with whoops of delight from many music fans fed up with seeing mobiles thrust into their line of sight at every public event.\nMany of them longed for the days when the only thing illuminating the crowd at a packed gig would be a sea of cigarette lighters, held aloft during the more tender moments - and not, as is now more often the case, the glow of the mobile phone.\n\"I would never turn on a cell phone at any musical event,\" wrote Roger Waters, former bassist and vocalist for Pink Floyd.\nContinue reading the main story âStart Quote\nPeople behind you are like 'put your phone down we can't see'â\nEnd Quote\nBring Me The Horizon fan\n\"It would seem to me to show a lack of respect to and care for fellow concert goers, or for that matter the artist.\n\"Apart from anything else, how could I possibly truly experience the thing I'd paid to see and hear, if I was fiddling with an iPhone, filming or twittering or chatting or whatever?\"\n'Weak and distorted'\nTo make matters worse, the type of footage recorded at gigs tends to have, as one Guardian journalist put it this week, \"audio quality that would make Simon and Garfunkel sound like Slayer\".\nSophisticated as it may be, your smartphone's microphone is only capable of capturing anything and everything immediately around it.\nBut one company emerging from Dublin's blossoming start-up scene thinks it has the answer - and appears to have record labels on its side.\n\"What our unique proprietary technology is able to do is take the poor quality on-camera audio from fan videos, and we analyse that and can see the patterns, even though it's very weak and distorted,\" explains Cathal Furey, co-founder of the firm, 45sound.\n\"The technology takes those patterns and matches it against what we call a master audio recording, which would be a professional live audio recording [from the same gig].\"\nPlease turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\nThis clip shows original gig footage shot by a fan at a Deap Vally gig, and then the same clip with fixed audio provided by 45sound\nFrom here, clips are re-uploaded with the high-quality audio, and in cases where there's more than one recording of the same moment, fans watching the gig on 45sound can switch camera angles.\nIn recent years, several sites have sought to make use of the swathes of fan footage recorded on a nightly basis.\nApps such as Vyclone have been used by the likes of Ed Sheeran to \"crowdsource\" gig footage, with fans being encouraged to upload their recordings of Ed for it then to be edited together for the official music video.\nAnother start-up, OutListen, gathers fan videos and, if there's sufficient interest, will go to record labels after a big show and request the professionally recorded audio.\nOli Sykes prompts the crowd at his band's gig to record one particular track\nBut Mr Furey believes it is 45sound's audio-matching software which gives it the edge over rivals - meaning no human intervention is needed in order to whip the clips into a listenable state.\n\"It's all completely automated,\" he says.\n\"What we're trying to build is a scaleable company. I'll be happy when one day we do a thousand shows in one night.\"\nSony trial\nVital to this scalability is in building relationships with record labels. To that end, 45sound has the ear of several companies - including Sony Music-owned RCA Records.\nOne of their acts, Bring Me The Horizon, has been trialling 45sound on their latest tour - prompting fans to record their show and upload it after the gig.\n\"It compliments the whole marketing plan,\" says Justin Cross, head of digital marketing for RCA.\n\"A lot of the artists we work with at RCA are live bands - if you're watching someone's video of Bring Me The Horizon and you can see for yourself how fantastic they are live, you're probably going to want to go and see them.\"\nAs part of their trial with 45sound, Bring Me The Horizon's vocalist Oli Sykes prompts fans during the gig to record one particular song.\nFor those who hate people recording, it may seem an irritating, even inconsiderate request - but it is somewhat tactical, the 26-year-old tells the BBC ahead of the band's gig in Bristol.\n\"When we did it in Leeds the other day it was almost like it got it out of everyone's system.\n\"Everyone filmed the song, and then everyone put [their cameras] down and everyone got back into it so it was cool.\"\n'Put your phone down'\nMeanwhile, in the shivering cold outside the venue, Bring Me The Horizon's fans are divided in their views of gig etiquette.\n\"People behind you are like 'put your phone down we can't see',\" says one female fan.\n\"I think people kind of like just want to just get into it without standing around with your arm in the air all the time filming.\"\nAnother fan, male, has more enthusiasm towards the web's possibilities.\n\"It's always good when people film it, you can go on YouTube and see it, and relive it, and see all the people in the comments talking about it - you can make more friends with that as well.\"\nPlease turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\nComedian Marcus Brigstocke and Graham Lambert, from Inspiral Carpets on phones at gigs\nFor record companies like RCA Records, it's a situation that requires delicate compromise, says Mr Cross.\n\"From a label perspective, and my perspective as a fan, it's something that's just part of a gig now, you can't get away from it.\n\"On one side of things, it can be quite annoying for the fan that isn't into doing this, but on the other side it's helping to push the band.\"\nBut 45sound's Mr Furey argues some events are just too good not to be widely shared.\n\"I can definitely see that having a sea of cameras can ruin the experience. Ultimately the most important person is the person who pays for a ticket to go and see the show.\n\"At the same time, I've been at other events where my first reaction is 'who's videoing this?'. Live music shows are an incredible human event - they're very tribal, very powerful, very emotional.\"\nSo while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs join a select group of grumblers that includes the likes of Jarvis Cocker, Jack White and the Stone Roses - it is likely that the \"sea of cameras\" is here to stay, and not just at gigs.\n\"I have that problem in general life myself,\" reflects Bring Me The Horizon's Mr Sykes.\n\"I find a lot of people are documenting too much stuff... rather than just living it.\"\nÂ \nMore on This Story\nRelated Stories\nMusic piracy 'down' as revenues rise\n27 FEBRUARY 2013,\nTECHNOLOGY\n'Digital is saving, not killing music' Watch\n26 FEBRUARY 2013,\nTECHNOLOGY\nMusic, TV and digital disruption\n07 FEBRUARY 2013,\nTECHNOLOGY\nComments\nThis entry is now closed for comments\nJump to comments pagination Â \nEditors' Picks\nAll Comments 676\nOrder by:\nLatest First\nHighest Rated\nLowest Rated\nrate this\n+3\nrate this\n+3\nComment number 456.\nHere s hoping\n12th April 2013 - 13:33 Whenever I have tried to video a gig (and it never happened really more than once) I found my concentration was focused on something other than the experience and so didn't enjoy it as much.

And we all know who uses gay pens, donât we?\nâAfter that, itâs a matter of personal conscience how the teachers proceed, but my own view is that they should ask the pupil if theyâre currently using their dirty homo pen to write a love poem to Alan Carrâs testicles.\nâThis method will only work on male pupils, but the girls will just know their place and do as theyâre told.â\nAny pupil refusing to sign will be ignored by staff, on the grounds that they cannot understand them because they do not speak âPoovishâ.\nThe pupils will also be excluded from after-school activities until they hand in their Gay Card.\nStaff at Catholic junior schools will take a more sensitive approach by telling the children that bad people want to kill their mummy and replace her with a big hairy man who hates the Baby Jesus.\nNichols added: âThis is a very serious issue â shut up, it is â and I think we should be applauded for not getting all Inquisition-y about it.

On her return Liz discovered that most of her friends were now married with children.\nâI would go to a dinner party on a Friday night and the talk would be nothing but primary schools, which I didn't have a clue about,â said Liz. âIf I was really unlucky there would be the dreaded spare man for me to be set up with, then because the parents had to get up early for the kids the whole thing would be over by 10.15pm.â\nWhile doing a series of financial jobs while she was here Liz bemoaned the Belfast dating scene.\nâI tried to date online,â Liz explains. âI met one guy online who told me was 46, 5ft 10ins and sent me a picture of a guy with dark hair. When we Skyped he told me his webcam was broken so he could see me but I couldn't see him. Then we met for lunch. My first thought was, why would you send your dad on a date? It turned out he was 54, not 46 and that picture was 24 years old.â\nWorking in the financial sector in the world's largest city had previously given Liz a busy social life. âOn a Friday or Saturday night someone from work would send out at text arranging to meet at a restaurant and you could bring anyone you liked with you. You would end up in a crowd of 20 out of which you had met two before. It was a fantastic way to meet people,â says Liz.\nâI also had a bit of a habit of matching people together, I would think that so and so would get on really well with someone else and it usually worked. A pair of my best friends are married now because I introduced them.â\nA friend of Liz's, Kim Johnston, had also recently returned from London and was lamenting the lack of a dating scene for singles over the age of 35. They came up with the idea of a night out for single people to meet and mingle.\nâIt was supposed to be a one off,â says Liz. âWe booked a private dining room for 30 people in Deanes restaurant in Belfast and started asking people if they would like to come. I had done everything you're supposed to when you move somewhere new. I had joined the tennis club, the gym, the book club and I started asking single people I'd met through those if they wanted to come.â\nIn all 34 people attended that first evening in March 2009 â 17 men and 17 women. At that point, things started to change.\nâMy phone didn't stop ringing after that,â says Liz. âPeople had heard of it and were asking if I was doing another one. For two years the fine dining was just a hobby for me until September last year when I registered as a sole trader. Now this is a full time job.â\nAnyone wishing to take part in the dinner party must first arrange to meet with Liz in person. She takes up residence in the Wellington Park Hotel in Belfast most weekday evenings and asks everyone to bring a passport or driver's license with them. Small touches like this are for everyone's safety.\nâI turned down one guy recently who refused to meet me and bring ID with him,â explains Liz. âHe just sounded odd and it didn't sit right with me.â\nNext, Liz will spend around half an hour going through a form with the potential diner about their hobbies, likes and dislikes and what they are looking for in a partner. Getting to know the individual will help Liz to introduce them to like-minded people.\nâIt also means that whoever comes to the dining club, particularly women on their own, will know at least one person in the room â me. I might have met someone else who I think would make a good match and introduce them straight away.â\nThe meeting also enables Liz to make sure people are ready to start dating again. She has a strict rule that people must be divorced or separated for at least a year before they attend the dining club.\nâI had a farmer phone me up,â says Liz. âHe told me he was thinking of leaving his wife and thought it might be a good idea for him to come along. I turned him down straight away.â\nGuests are met with a Champagne reception before they sit down to a three-course meal. The gentlemen move two places between each course so most people have the opportunity to meet and chat over the course of the evening.\nThe next day Liz will phone to find out how many people clicked with each other . She will encourage dates, up to three so you can be sure, for those who got on well but didn't necessarily find each other attractive.\nâIt can take a while for a couple to gel and really start to get along and I think that takes at least three dates,â says Liz.\nTo join the Fine Dining Club costs Â£500 a year, a similar fee to an online dating site such as eHarmony for a year. There are no prerequisites such as educational qualifications or income. âI have consultants, MLAs and judges but I also have plumbers, electricians and so on that come. There are three people in the club who appear on the Irish Rich List and I didn't even know they were wealthy until I read it. We have all sorts of people, they just need to be single.â\nIt's been such a success Liz has also launched the Country Dining Club. Designed specifically for farmers or those living in the country. Diners have been known to come from as far as Donegal and Monaghan. There are also social events open to non-members. Tickets cost Â£100 and include a Champagne jazz reception, a three course meal and the evening will be rounded off with a DJ for singles.\nThanks to the Fine Dining Club there have been three marriages, two babies, more than 50 ongoing relationships and well over 1,000 dates. Liz modestly says she can't take all the credit.\nâTwo off the marriages I didn't see coming. The first came from the very first club and I wasn't expecting it at all.â\nLiz didn't expect the Fine Dining Club to reach that heights it has but she's looking forward to expanding to Dublin and elsewhere. For her, this is a more honest form of dating. Statistics show that 60% of people lie on their online profiles lie about their weight with 48% lying about their height. Liz completely agrees with these figures. She says: âMen lie about their height and their income, women lie about their weight and their age. It's one of the reasons I ask everyone for ID.\nâThis way it's a bit safer for women and a little more honest â it's harder to lie in person.â\nâI nearly turned the car around on way to dinnerâ\nJane, (43), is divorced and runs her own business in Newtownards. She says:\nWhen I tried internet dating I felt that all the men on it were married. Either that, or in their profiles they would say they were 6ft 2ins and when you'd met them in a coffee shop they would be 5ft 4ins.\nI'm a tall girl so there's a reason I look for tall men and I could never understand why they thought they wouldn't be found out.\nI heard Liz talking on the radio and phoned her up. You meet her in somewhere like the Wellington Park Hotel and she takes you through a form that will give her a bit of a feel for you. She seems to work her dinner parties around those who are around the same age group with the same interests.\nYou do get a bit nervous before you go to the first one. I nearly turned the car around on my way there but I made myself go and as soon as I got there Liz put me at ease. She took me by the hand and brought me to a group of people she thought I would get on with. I've been to three or four dinner parties now and I've really enjoyed each of them. I have gone on dates afterwards and Liz really helps you with that too.\nShe makes sure you're wearing the right thing and that you're not too nervous. A friend of mind who came with me one night dated two guys at once and is now still with one of them.\nIt's an event that pushes you out of your comfort zone but once you go it's so easy.\nYou are seated between two single men and if you don't like anyone you just wait until they move on for the next course. It's much easier than going into town and meeting someone with beer goggles on who won't even remember speaking to you the next day.â\nWhy single farmer George wanted a wife\nGeorge (45) is a farmer and single parent from Co. Down. He says:\nI saw the advert for the Country Dining Club in the Farming Life and then got in touch with Liz. She told me what she was trying to do and I thought I would go for a laugh if nothing else. You find when you work on a farm and you're a single parent you don't really get out to see people the way others would. I wouldn't do internet dating. I would prefer to meet people face to face rather than have them hide behind a computer screen.\nI've now been to three dinner parties. You do get nervous before the first one because you don't really know what the protocol is but Liz absolutely puts you at ease. I like that everyone there is from a similar background and I've even met people I would have known years ago on the singles scene before I got married.\nI've met some lovely people and had a great time. I've been on some dates which I enjoyed even though we didn't suit each other. It's nice to know that there's a bit of potential out there for you.â\nThe next Fine Dining Club open to the public is the Spring Fling which takes place at the Wellington Park Hotel on Saturday.

Take this opportunity to get to the bottom of the issue. What's at work is a personality clash. This can be remedied by keeping two people as far apart as possible. Alternatively, it may be necessary to fire someone who has been abusive and lazy. Do whatever it takes to get the operation back on track. You'll have to make some unpopular decisions, but that's better than letting everything fall apart at the seams.More\nRead Your Sign\nAries\nTaurus\nGemini\nCancer\nLeo\nVirgo\nLibra\nScorpio\nSagittarius\nCapricorn\nAquarius\nPisces\nBy using this website you consent to our use of cookies.

It is rare in the UK nowadays and is usually mild.\nThe characteristic symptom of scarlet fever is a widespread, fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch. It may start in one area, but soon spreads to many parts of the body, such as the ears, neck and chest. The rash may be itchy.\nSomeone with scarlet fever will develop a flushed, red face - hence the name scarlet fever - although the skin around the mouth stays white. The tongue may look a bit like a strawberry.\nOther symptoms include swollen neck glands, especially if you generally feel unwell.\nRead more about the symptoms of scarlet fever.\nSymptoms usually develop one to four days after a person is infected.\nScarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection (called impetigo) that is caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria.\nScarlet fever is also known as scarlatina, although this sometimes refers to a milder form of the disease.\nHow it spreads\nScarlet fever is very contagious. It can be caught by breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes.\nFind out more about the causes of scarlet fever.\nWho is affected?\nAnybody can catch scarlet fever, but it usually affects children aged four to eight years old. Because it's so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone who is in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. It may also affect someone who lives in a crowded environment, such as day care.\nYou will only develop the symptoms of scarlet fever if you're susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 will have developed immunity to the toxins from streptococcal bacteria, and children under two will have acquired immunity from their mothers.\nOutlook\nAlthough scarlet fever used to be a very serious disease, most cases today are mild.\nScarlet fever is easily treatable with antibiotics, which must be taken for 10 days. Most people recover after four to five days.\nFind out more about treating scarlet fever.\nThere is no evidence that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, pregnant women should tell healthcare staff if they are in contact with streptococcal infections, such as scarlet fever, around the time of the birth.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics are medicines that can treat infections caused by micro-organisms, usually bacteria or fungi. Examples of antibiotics include amoxicillin, streptomycin and erythromycin.\nBacteria\nBacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms that live in the body. Some can cause illness and disease and some others are good for you.\n \nSymptoms of scarlet fever\nSymptoms of scarlet fever generally take one to four days to appear after infection.\nThe illness often starts with a sore throat or skin infection and fever. The rash appears 12 to 48 hours after the fever.\nRash\nRed blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like sunburn.\nThe rash may start in one place but soon spreads to many other parts of the body. It commonly affects the ears, neck, chest, elbows, inner thighs and groin.\nThe rash does not normally spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.\nThe rash lasts for six days, then usually fades from the top of the body downwards. It usually disappears within a week. The rash may be itchy and usually occurs alongside other symptoms (see below). In milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the rash may be the only symptom.\nOther symptoms\nOther symptoms may include:\nheadache \nswollen neck glands \nloss of appetite\nnausea or vomiting\nstomach pain \nbroken blood vessels in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which cause red streaks that may last a couple of days after the rash has gone (these are known as pastia lines)\na white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)\na general feeling of being unwell\nIf you feel very unwell, with severe muscle aches, diarrhoea or vomiting, see your doctor. This is to rule out other infections caused by streptococcal bacteria, such as toxic shock syndrome, which can be easily treated if caught early.\nOuter layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for up to six weeks after the scarlet fever rash has faded.\nFever\nA fever, or high temperature, is when someone's body temperature goes above the normal 37°C (98.6°F).\nNausea\nNausea is when you feel like you are going to be sick.\n \nCauses of scarlet fever\nScarlet fever is extremely contagious.\nIt can be caught by:\nbreathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes\ntouching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection\nsharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen\nIt can also be spread by people who have the bacteria in their throat but do not show any symptoms (known as carriers).\nYou will only develop the symptoms of scarlet fever if you are susceptible to the toxins released by streptococcal bacteria.\nDiagnosing scarlet fever\nYour GP can usually diagnose scarlet fever by looking at the characteristic rash and other symptoms.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a sample of saliva is taken from the back of the throat, known as a throat swab, and tested in a laboratory. This reveals which bacteria have caused the infection. A blood test is sometimes required.\nScarlet fever is a notifiable disease. This means that doctors must report any cases to the local health protection unit so they can monitor the spread of disease.\nBacteria\nBacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms that live in the body. Some can cause illness and disease and others are good for you.\nBlood test\nA sample of blood is taken from a vein, using a needle, so it can be examined in a laboratory.\nFever\nA fever or high temperature is when someone's body temperature goes above the normal 37C (98.6F).\nTreating scarlet fever\nMost mild cases of scarlet fever go away in about a week without treatment.\nHowever, you are advised to get treatment as this will speed recovery. There is also a higher risk of complications from scarlet fever if you don't have treatment.\nMost people recover around four to five days after starting treatment.\nAntibiotics\nThe most common treatment for scarlet fever is a 10-day course of antibiotics. This will usually be penicillin taken by mouth. For people who are allergic to penicillin, the antibiotic erythromycin can be used instead.\nStay at home for at least 24 hours after you start treatment.\nSymptoms usually go in a few days if the antibiotics are taken properly. The whole course of treatment must be finished to make sure the infection is fully cleared.\nThe fever will normally disappear within 12 to 24 hours of starting antibiotics.\nOther treatments\nOther ways to treat the symptoms of scarlet fever include:\ndrinking plenty of cool fluids, especially if you do not have much of an appetite\nkeeping the room cool\ntaking paracetamol to relieve aches and pains and bring down a high temperature\nusing calamine lotion to relieve itching of the rash\nAllergic\nAn allergen is a substance that reacts with the body's immune system and causes an allergic reaction.\nAntibiotic\nAntibiotics are medicines that treat infections caused by micro-organisms, usually bacteria or fungi. Examples of antibiotics include amoxicillin, streptomycin and erythromycin.\nHigh temperature\nA high temperature or fever is when someone's body temperature goes above the normal 37C (98.6F).\nComplications of scarlet fever\nMost cases of scarlet fever cause no complications.\nOn rare occasions, one of the following complications may occur:\near infection \nthroat abscess\nsinusitis \nkidney inflammation\npneumonia \nrheumatic fever, which causes pain in the joints\nComplications usually happen only if scarlet fever is not treated or if treatment is unsuccessful.\nVery rare complications include:\nmeningitis \nacute kidney failure\nblood poisoning \nnecrotising fasciitis (a flesh-eating disease)\ntoxic shock syndrome (a rare, life-threatening bacterial infection)\nosteomyelitis (infection of the bone)\nYou may have one of these rare complications if you are very unwell, in severe pain and have severe headache, vomiting or diarrhoea. See your GP if any of these symptoms appear in the first few weeks after the main infection has cleared up.\nAcute\nAcute means occuring suddenly or over a short period of time.\nFever\nA fever or high temperature is when someone's body temperature goes above the normal 37C (98.6F).\nInflammation\nInflammation is the body's response to infection, irritation or injury. It causes redness, swelling, pain and sometimes a feeling of heat in the affected area.\nImmunity\nThe immune system is the body's defence system, which helps protect it from disease, bacteria and viruses.\nPreventing scarlet fever\nScarlet fever is highly infectious. It is spread through close physical contact with someone who has it, or by breathing in bacteria in droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes.\nIf your child has scarlet fever, do not let them go to school and keep them away from other people until they have been on a course of antibiotics for at least 24 hours.\nAll tissues and handkerchiefs that someone with scarlet fever has coughed or sneezed into should be washed or disposed of immediately. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water if you have touched any of these.\nBacteria can be spread by touching someone with a streptococcal skin infection or by sharing contaminated eating utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels.\nScarlet fever is not common in adults. To avoid catching scarlet fever while you are pregnant and to avoid getting the symptoms, such as a high temperature and sore throat, try to keep away from any children who have a suspicious-looking skin rash.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics are medicines that can be used to treat infections caused by micro-organisms, usually bacteria or fungi. Examples of antibiotics include amoxicillin, streptomycin and erythromycin.\nBacteria\nBacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms that live in the body. Some can cause illness and disease and others are good for you.\nFever\nA fever or high temperature is when someone's body temperature goes above the normal 37C (98.6F).\nTissues\nBody tissue is made up of groups of cells that perform a specific job, such as protecting the body against infection, producing movement or storing fat.  \n \nTop\nHealth Advice\nConditions A-Z of Conditions\nCancers\nCommon Conditions\nEmbarrassing Problems\nEmbarrassing Problems\nFamily Health Baby and Infant\nChildhood Vaccinations\nChildren\nMen\nPregnancy & birth\nSexual Health\nTrying for a baby\nWomen\nYour home medicine chest\nHealthier Living Allergies-airborne\nAllergies - foodborne\nBody and Soul\nHealthy Eating\nSkincare\nSun protection\nSunburn\nSeniors\nSmoking Cessation\nSupport Groups\nTravel Health\nHealth Wallet\nWhy Register Now?\nLogin\nMain Menu\nHome\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nNews\nLinks\nHealth Advice\nPharmacy Services\nPharmacy Locator\nLeaflets Pharmacy Leaflets\nHealth Leaflets\nIn-store offers\nHealth Calendar\nTerms & Conditions\nNews Letter\nName:\nEmail:\nDisclaimer | Privacy Policy\nCopyright © www.albapharm.co.uk and www.medicinechest.co.uk and www.bowburn-pharmacy.co.uk\nPharmacy websites with free domain name, hosting and back up by The Pharmacy Centre\nProviding web development for Pharmacy"],

The research will then produce bespoke instruments for interactive policy, prototype and design development.\nThe project brings together experts in design, computer science, political science, media, psychology, sociology, and risk management, and findings will inform future government and security policy on identity management and its implementation, as well as provide resources for further research.\nThe IMPRINTS project is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). An additional grant has been awarded by the Department of Homeland Security in America to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to simultaneously conduct the study in the America.\nIt started in September 2011 and was included in the recent report Big Ideas for the Future which was published by the Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Universities UK.\n−ENDS−\nFor all media enquiries contact:\nChris Goddard\nPR Officer\nLoughborough University\nT: 01509 223491\nE: C.J.Goddard@lboro.ac.uk \nNotes for editors:\nLoughborough is one of the country’s leading universities, with an international reputation for research that matters, excellence in teaching, strong links with industry, and unrivalled achievement in sport and its underpinning academic disciplines.\nIt was awarded the coveted Sunday Times University of the Year 2008-09 title, and is consistently ranked in the top twenty of UK universities in national newspaper league tables. In the 2011 National Student Survey, Loughborough was voted one of the top universities in the UK, and has topped the Times Higher Education league for the Best Student Experience in England every year since the poll's inception in 2006. In recognition of its contribution to the sector, the University has been awarded six Queen's Anniversary Prizes.\nIt is a member of the 1994 Group of 12 leading research-intensive universities. The Group was established in 1994 to promote excellence in university research and teaching. Each member undertakes diverse and high-quality research, while ensuring excellent levels of teaching and student experience.\nSearch news\nSearch events:\nContact us\nPublic Relations Office\nLoughborough University\nLeicestershire\nLE11 3TU\nTel: 01509 222224\nFax: 01509 223902\nEmail\nFind out more\nThe View magazine\nVice Chancellor's Office\nPage maintained by: publicrelations@lboro.ac.uk\nThis page was last updated on\nWednesday December 5, 2012 11:36\n© Loughborough University\nLegal information | Freedom of Information | Top of page"],

Has there been any publicity â€“ good or bad - about the company?\nThe most important part of buying a new kitchen is the planning. What shape will the kitchen have, how big is the family that will use the kitchen and how often will the kitchen be used? The planning of your new kitchen is important whichever style you choose.\nThe first step to your new kitchen is to set a budget. Choosing your new kitchen whether you decide to have it professionally designed and installed or perhaps embark on your own DIY project, it is important to have an understanding of what you will be spending your money on and why there is such a large range of prices.\nThere are many companies who can provide advice and support in designing and installing your new kitchen ï¿½ some will provide the complete service from design through to installation and others will fit the kitchen that you have designed and purchased. Obviously, the more work you do the less the process will cost, but be realistic about your own DIY skills, DIY mistakes can be very costly to repair, sometimes paying the extra for the expert will make life easier and your final bill cheaper in the long run.\nThe final result should be your dream kitchen within your financial capacity and, with the right supplier and/or fitter this is always achievable. The right designer, supplier and/or kitchen fitter will work with you to maximise your space within your budget.\nNEW KITCHENS WORCESTERSHIRE | FITTED KITCHEN DESIGN WORCESTERSHIRE | A PRICE FOR A FITTED KITCHEN | BESPOKE KITCHENS WORCESTERSHIRE | KITCHEN SALES WORCESTERSHIRE | FITTED KITCHEN PRICES WORCESTERSHIRE | NEW FITTED KITCHENS WORCESTERSHIRE | KITCHEN IDEAS WORCESTERSHIRE | PRICES FOR FITTED KITCHENS WORCESTERSHIRE | KITCHENS FOR SALE WORCESTERSHIRE | KITCHEN PLANNERS WORCESTERSHIRE | A NEW FITTED KITCHEN WORCESTERSHIRE\nWebsite © copyright Design & Hosting - www.bestquote4webdesign.co.uk"],

        "content_text":["Glorious Trash: TNT #6: Ritual Of Blood\nGlorious Trash\nTrawling the depths of forgotten fiction, films, and beyond, with yer pal, Joe Kenney\nMonday, September 20, 2010\nTNT #6: Ritual Of Blood\nTNT #6: Ritual Of Blood, by Doug Masters\nMarch, 1986 Charter Books\n(French publication, 1980)\nRitual of Blood was #6 in the 7-volume US publication of the TNT series, but it was actually the ninth and final volume of the original French publication, where it was titled Le 10e Mari De Barbe-Bleue (aka Bluebeard's 10th Husband, cover below). So, even though there was one more installment of Tony Nicholas Twin's wild adventures in the English version of this whacked-out series, as far as the original French was concerned, this was it; this was his last ride.\nThis is probably my favorite volume of the series. It's like the psycho-sexual horror version of the series, TNT gone giallo, injected with a healthy dose of dark comedy. Taking the war of the sexes to surreal extremes, Twin's enemies this time out are a cabal of men-hating women: half of them giant-sized freaks with beards, the other half call girls with stupefying bodies. Their modus operandi is to ensnare multi-millionaire men (shortly after their families have died in some \"accident\"), marry them and overcome them with a little kinky sex for a few months, and then murder them. Sordid enough, but add into the mix a host of s&m hijinks, mazelike corridors in the guts of the earth which become death-traps, and a shadowy monster which lurks in a pit of darkness and feasts on the severed heads of beautiful women.\nThe opening half's a bit busy; unlike previous volumes, which were separated into three separate \"books,\" Ritual of Blood narrative-hops for the first hundred pages or so, jumping from Twin in Ireland, to his boss/archenemy Arnold Benedict in Japan (and later an overseas flight), and to a gorgeous, nameless woman currently posing as two different wealthy wives in New York City -- \"Bluebeard\" herself, this installment's \"she-who-destroys-men\" (every volume of TNT has had one) -- who is busily ruining the lives of her latest conquests.\nBenedict learns via an uber-wealthy acquaintance that a handful of men with over 200 million dollars to their name have gone missing over the past few years, each of them shortly after having married an incredibly attractive woman. These women also disappear shortly thereafter. It all appears to be the work of a mysterious group called Matrix, a sort of Women's Lib movement gone Nazi, women who are dedicated to eradicating male control and putting women in charge of everything (Rush Limbaugh probably read this novel at an impressionable age). The aforementioned \"Bluebeard\" is the beauty and the brains of the outfit; the brawn comes from Hester Dragut, a seven-foot-tall bearded Turkish woman who commands a similar army of freakish, monstrous women.\nBenedict's first thought is to use Twin as bait, to set him up as a millionaire and wait for the Matrix women to swoop in for him. Twin meanwhile is performing his own investigation. In a grisly scene early on, Twin and his \"assistant\" Clare Hallam visit Twin's multi-millionaire friend in rural Ireland. There they find the entire family murdered. Even the man's children are dead, each of them shot through the mouth. Decapitated bodies litter the mansion and the surrounding countryside. Twin's millionaire friend still lives however, and Twin promises to help find out who committed this atrocity. But after getting to New York City, meeting a dwarf prostitute named Evangeline Tombs, and nearly drowning in a metal maze of congealing plaster, Twin finally relents and takes part in Benedict's scheme.\nHere's where Ritual of Blood really gets enjoyable. You can tell this was the send-off for the original series, as all of the supporting characters reappear and interract in ways highly entertaining for longtime readers. For Benedict's plan is for Twin to pose as a millionaire named \"John Wayne:\" Dawlish, the English soldier nutcase of previous volumes, poses as Twin's older brother as well as the family idiot; Valka the Titan, the hulking Russian powerlifter from The Beast and Killer Angel, poses as Twin's \"littlest\" brother.\nThe Matrix gals close in, launching a late-night assault on New York City's Waldorf-Astoria. Suddenly it's as if \"Doug Masters\" is a pseudonym of Thomas Pynchon; a truly bizarre sequence occurs in which gorgeous call-girls who serve Matrix take on the gorgeous call-girls who work for Corrie Corlington (Arnold Benedict's head of security and a former call-girl herself), blasting away at one another in the plush surroundings with crossbows and silencer-equipped submachine guns. Twin meanwhile meets Bluebeard; her beauty is such that she stuns even Twin, who by this point in the series has had sex with around 200 women or so.\nThe novel becomes even more surreal. Bluebeard shows Twin that she has four million dollars of her own -- she doesn't want him for his (fake) money. She wants him for a night's pleasure. What follows is one of those over-the-top TNT moments: Bluebeard has had a special \"mirror bed\" created for the occasion, a bed made of thin mirror which has been attached to a helicopter. The 'copter lifts them off and Twin and Bluebeard have sex on the fragile glass as nighttime New York City glitters beneath them.\nRitual of Blood climaxes with the usual TNT disdain for reality: Twin is taken to a Medieval-era castle which has been rebuilt in the Arizona desert; he is caught in a giant spider web and combats giant spiders and a family of \"spider-men;\" Corrie Corlington leads a call-girl cavalry charge on the castle, complete with a bugler; Hester Dragut exacts jealous revenge on Bluebeard; and meanwhile Arnold Benedict stumbles around in a full suit of Medieval armor.\nHere's the cover to the original French publication, Le 10e Mari De Barbe-Bleue:\nPosted by\nJoe Kenney\nat\n10:00 AM\nLabels:\nBook Reviews,\nCharter Books,\nDoug Masters,\nMen's Adventure Novels,\nPierre Rey,\nTNT\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nYer Host\nLabels\nBook Reviews\n(265)\nMen's Adventure Novels\n(178)\nTrash Fiction\n(61)\nPinnacle Books\n(37)\nSci-Fi\n(30)\nPocket Books\n(27)\nLeisure Books\n(23)\npsychedelic\n(21)\nGlorious Trash Hall of Fame\n(18)\nHorror\n(18)\nSignet Books\n(18)\nLionel Derrick\n(17)\nManor Books\n(17)\nPenetrator\n(17)\nPost-Nuke Pulps\n(16)\nCharter Books\n(14)\nDell\n(14)\nGold Eagle\n(14)\nMartial Arts\n(13)\nPyramid Books\n(13)\nExecutioner\n(12)\nHistorical Fiction\n(12)\nZebra Books\n(12)\nAction Movies\n(11)\nGolden Age Hollywood\n(11)\nJove Books\n(11)\nMark Roberts\n(11)\nPierre Rey\n(11)\nChet Cunningham\n(10)\nToga Porn\n(10)\nBaroness\n(9)\nDavid Alexander\n(9)\nDonald Moffitt\n(9)\nDoug Masters\n(9)\nPaul Kenyon\n(9)\nSex\n(9)\nTNT\n(9)\nBantam Books\n(8)\nBruno Rossi\n(8)\nBurt Hirschfeld\n(8)\nHarold Robbins\n(8)\nJoseph Rosenberger\n(8)\nLeonard Levinson\n(8)\nMarksman\n(8)\nRyder Stacy\n(8)\nSharpshooter\n(8)\nTough Cops\n(8)\nAndrew Sugar\n(7)\nAvon Books\n(7)\nBelmont-Tower\n(7)\nDon Pendleton\n(7)\nDoomsday Warrior\n(7)\nEnforcer\n(7)\nExpeditor\n(7)\nHugh Barron\n(7)\nJohn Shirley\n(7)\nPaul Edwards\n(7)\nPhoenix\n(7)\nFawcett Books\n(6)\nJohn Cutter\n(6)\nLancer Books\n(6)\nMIA Hunter\n(6)\nMarc Olden\n(6)\nNEL\n(6)\nNinjas\n(6)\nRussell Smith\n(6)\nSpecialist\n(6)\nWWII\n(6)\nBerkley Medallion\n(5)\nDeath Merchant\n(5)\nManning Lee Stokes\n(5)\nNarc\n(5)\nRobert Hawkes\n(5)\nAble Team\n(4)\nBlaxploitation\n(4)\nDan Schmidt\n(4)\nDean Ballenger\n(4)\nIan Ross\n(4)\nJohn Rossman\n(4)\nKung Fu\n(4)\nLee Chang\n(4)\nMace\n(4)\nMind Masters\n(4)\nMovie Reviews\n(4)\nTracker\n(4)\nZ-Comm\n(4)\nBallantine Books\n(3)\nBlack Dynamite\n(3)\nCADS\n(3)\nDJ Mixes\n(3)\nFrank Scarpetta\n(3)\nFunk\n(3)\nGannon\n(3)\nGolden Voyager Trilogy\n(3)\nGrindhouse\n(3)\nHerbert Kastle\n(3)\nInterviews\n(3)\nJames Glickenhaus\n(3)\nJohn Sievert\n(3)\nNazi She-Devils\n(3)\nPaul Petersen\n(3)\nPeter McCurtin\n(3)\nPopular Library\n(3)\nRambo\n(3)\nRobert Lory\n(3)\nSimon Finch\n(3)\nSmuggler\n(3)\nSouveneir Press\n(3)\nAttar the Merman\n(2)\nBlack Samurai\n(2)\nCharles Rigdon\n(2)\nGH Frost\n(2)\nGerald Montgomery\n(2)\nHitman\n(2)\nJake Quinn\n(2)\nJazz\n(2)\nJoe Haldeman\n(2)\nMartin Saul\n(2)\nMarvel Comics\n(2)\nMichael Jai White\n(2)\nMondo\n(2)\nNinja Master\n(2)\nNorman Winski\n(2)\nPhoenix Force\n(2)\nRaymond Obstfeld\n(2)\nRichard Blade\n(2)\nRobert Graham\n(2)\nRyker\n(2)\nShannon\n(2)\nSoldier For Hire\n(2)\nSuperBolan\n(2)\nTimothy Leary\n(2)\nWade Barker\n(2)\nWilliam Fieldhouse\n(2)\nblacklight posters\n(2)\nAdam Diment\n(1)\nAmazon\n(1)\nBrian Boyer\n(1)\nBronson\n(1)\nCanon Group\n(1)\nCybernarc\n(1)\nDestroyer\n(1)\nExterminator\n(1)\nGar Wilson\n(1)\nGrove Press\n(1)\nGuardians\n(1)\nGuy N Smith\n(1)\nHarmless Records\n(1)\nHeadhunters\n(1)\nHolloway House\n(1)\nIceman\n(1)\nJackie Chan\n(1)\nJoe Rigg\n(1)\nJohn Weisman\n(1)\nJoseph Nazel\n(1)\nKirby Carr\n(1)\nLance Horner\n(1)\nMen's Adventure Magazines\n(1)\nMutants Amok\n(1)\nPaul Eiden\n(1)\nPhilip Rawls\n(1)\nPulp Fusion\n(1)\nRat Bastards\n(1)\nSOBs\n(1)\nSabat\n(1)\nSavage Report\n(1)\nSlaves of the Empire\n(1)\nSoul\n(1)\nSpider-Man '67\n(1)\nSpringblade\n(1)\nStar Trek\n(1)\nSteele\n(1)\nStony Man\n(1)\nThe Force\n(1)\nThe Hitman\n(1)\nVictor Milan\n(1)\ncosmic comics\n(1)\nAbout Me\nJoe Kenney\nView my complete profile\nBlog Archive\n► \n2013\n(34)\n► \nMay\n(1)\n► \nApril\n(9)\n► \nMarch\n(8)\n► \nFebruary\n(8)\n► \nJanuary\n(8)\n► \n2012\n(96)\n► \nDecember\n(8)\n► \nNovember\n(9)\n► \nOctober\n(9)\n► \nSeptember\n(8)\n► \nAugust\n(9)\n► \nJuly\n(8)\n► \nJune\n(7)\n► \nMay\n(7)\n► \nApril\n(8)\n► \nMarch\n(9)\n► \nFebruary\n(7)\n► \nJanuary\n(7)\n► \n2011\n(87)\n► \nDecember\n(8)\n► \nNovember\n(6)\n► \nOctober\n(9)\n► \nSeptember\n(5)\n► \nAugust\n(8)\n► \nJuly\n(8)\n► \nJune\n(9)\n► \nMay\n(9)\n► \nApril\n(7)\n► \nMarch\n(8)\n► \nFebruary\n(6)\n► \nJanuary\n(4)\n▼ \n2010\n(67)\n► \nDecember\n(7)\n► \nNovember\n(8)\n► \nOctober\n(9)\n▼ \nSeptember\n(10)\nThe Headhunters #1: Heroin Triple Cross\nThe Kung Fu Avengers, by Michael Minick\nTNT #6: Ritual Of Blood\nJohn Eagle Expeditor #1: Needles of Death\nThe Sharpshooter #2: Blood Oath\nThe Smuggler #1\nConfessions Of A Hope Fiend\nBlack Dynamite: The Original Trailer and \"Fight Sm...\nThe Mind Masters #1\nPulp Fusion: Cheeba Cheeba Mix by Funky Bompa\n► \nAugust\n(8)\n► \nJuly\n(7)\n► \nJune\n(18)\nFollowers\nSimple template.

Barring mishaps, this looks more than likely, as they have now been 38 days at sea, with only a few more days to go until the finish.\nExtracts from their last few blogs show how tough this race has been, and how much of an achievement it is to have got this far.\n32 days at sea:\nÃ¢â¬ËHaving to sit in a cabin waiting, sitting, doing nothing, can easily seem like the easiest thing to do... The challenge, both physical and mental, is now a different beast.\nÃ¢â¬ËWhen the wind follows behind and pushes in the right direction, we work physically hard to make as much progress as possible and have done really well at that. When it turns against us, itÃ¢â¬â¢s easy to fight, like our attempt yesterday.\nÃ¢â¬ËAt the moment, having to sit and wait, is the toughest part of the event for us. We try to be patient.\nÃ¢â¬ËLetÃ¢â¬â¢s hope that that wins the day, and when we can continue to progress at some level, we will, little by little.Ã¢â¬â¢\nTwo days later came their most frustrating day to date when they were both holed up in the tiny cabin, being thrown around in stormy winds for a whole day.\n34 days at sea:\nÃ¢â¬ËProbably our toughest day yet. 18 hours inside a cabin together with little room... Rowing six hours is a dream at the moment. So bad that I went to air outside at the oars while we sorted our food out.\nÃ¢â¬ËWhen we start this time, the windows look ok for a few days (at this stage).... We wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be hanging around much!Ã¢â¬â¢\nNow the weather has finally changed in their favour and they are once again experiencing some of the pleasures associated with their particular challenge.\n36 days at sea:\nÃ¢â¬ËThe 4am to 6am session particularly memorable this morning. Flat calm water, beautiful hazy sunrise, a fish jumping two feet out of the water, tip toeing around 10 or so anchored tankers and the smallest dolphins (dwarphins?) IÃ¢â¬â¢ve ever seen! Just another day ..\nÃ¢â¬ËWind is picking up a little from the south but not too strong so weÃ¢â¬â¢re creeping along, making relatively good progress. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re under 300 miles now, hopefully under 200 in the next couple days!Ã¢â¬â¢\nCurrently, they have 170 miles to the finish. All their supporters are hoping that they continue to make their way safely in order to complete their challenge, raise money for their charities and break the two-man world rowing record.\nYou can follow them on their website gbrow2013.com which has Yellowbrick, a live tracker, links to their Facebook page and Twitter feed, and the details of the charities, together with a Paypal donation button.\nTweet\nComments on this sport item:\n0 comments on this sport item\nAdd your comment:\nSubmit your comment below :\nYour Name (required) :\nYour Email*(required) :\nYour Location (required) :\nSecurity question (required) : 9 + 4 =\nYour Comment (required) :\nMaximum Number of characters for this text box is 400.\nYou have 400 characters remaining for your description...\nI agree to the terms and conditions and comment rules (required) :\nThe South Hams Newspapers Ltd may edit your comments and not all comments may be published.\nYour comments may be published on any Tindle Newspaper Ltd. media.\n*Your email address will not be displayed.\nEnter the code as it is shown below (required):\n[This resource requires a Javascript enabled browser.]\nAdverts\nSports\nother\nPoll\nShould the South Hams be protected from large scale renewable energy schemes, such as solar and wind farms?\nThanks for voting.\nYes\n61.0%\nNo\n37.7%\nDon't know\n1.3%\nPoll History: click here\nMost Read\n1 Youth group comes highly commended\n2 Raising funds and Christmas spirit\n3 Demolish a house with an army tank\n4 Delight as Poppy Appeal money rolls in\n5 Fifty-fifty split over a turbine\nAdverts\nRSS\nDeliver the news to your desktop\nMobile\nBrowse our site on the go\nDigital or\nPrinted\nSubscribe to our newspaper\nArchives\nSearch though the archives\nPhotos\nBuy photos online\nSocial Bookmarks\nAdd news to your social networking page\nCopyright and Trade Mark Notice\nÂ© 2008 - 2013 owned by or licensed to Tindle Newspapers Ltd.\nPlease read our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Statement before using this site.\nTerms & Conditions | Tindle Newspapers | Site Credits"],

Alternatively, a family moving to the UK from overseas will have a broad range of advisers to whom they can turn, to implement a search in their chosen area and who can provide information on schooling opportunities and organise removal or quarantine arrangements, for example, amongst many other relevant needs.\nThe website enables relocatees to source specific services, through its constantly-expanding number of Affiliate Members, from such disparate activities as furniture hire to industrial cleaning.\nThe website contains new features including informative articles within the HR issues and People on the Move sections. Further advice and information can be found through the various ARA guides and publications.\nARA members are going to benefit too from the new website. They will be kept informed of all the Association’s activities, forthcoming events and, with their own page, they can advertise their services to the public. Members websites are also linked directly from their ARA page, leading the public to more in-depth information on the individual companies.\nChief Executive, Tad Zurlinden, says: “We are delighted, also, to have linked our website with HaysWorks, the recruitment specialists, and hope to link to other high profile sites within the Human Resources industry, to attract new business for our members.”\nFor more information about the ARA please contact:\nTad Zurlinden, ARA Chief Executive Tel: 08700 73 74 75\nGiles Harbottle, GHPR PR consultant to ARA Tel: 01747 838008.\nFor technical information on the new website www.relocationagents.com please contact:\nRoger Panton, Objective Internet Ltd.

Meanwhile our commitment to\nproviding out of the ordinary levels of personal service for our clients\nremains paramount.\nInvestec plc is an international specialist bank and asset manager that\nprovides a diverse range of financial products and services to a select\nclient base, principally in the United Kingdom, South Africa and\nAustralia.\nThe Investec group is a FTSE 100 company and is listed on both the\nLondon and Johannesburg stock exchanges. Investec Wealth &\nInvestment is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Investec and forms a\nkey part of the Wealth & Investment business unit.\nOur Core Values\nInvestec Wealth & Investment has ten core values, the guiding\nprinciples by which all our employees operate. Whilst all are\nimportant, the following are those relevant to our relationship with our\nclients:\nCast Iron Integrity\nWe demand cast iron integrity in all internal and external dealings,\nconsistently and uncompromisingly displaying moral strength and\nbehaviour which promotes trust.\nGoing the Extra Mile\nWe will go the extra mile to meet our clients’ expectations and\nrequirements, within the framework we operate in.\nRisk Consciousness\nWe promote individual flair and the freedom to operate within the\ncontext of a risk conscious framework, sound judgement and\nobligation to do things properly.\nSocial Responsibility\nWe are committed to supporting the community where our employees\nwork and will contribute to a greener world through our processes\nand behaviour.\nWhy Investec Wealth & Investment? – Client\nProtection\nInvestec Wealth & Investment is authorized and regulated by the\nFinancial Services Authority (FSA) and we are committed to\nmaintaining the highest standards of client protection.\nThe following measures are in addition to the usual maximum\ncompensation levels available under the Financial Services\nCompensation Scheme (FSCS) of £85,000 per person for claims\nrelating to cash deposits and £50,000 per person for claims relating\nto most investments.\nFull details of our client protection policies and procedures are\navailable upon request; however, the key points are as follows:\nSegregation of Assets – Assets of clients are held in trust within our\nnominee company and are recorded in such a manner as to clearly\nindicate they do not belong to the firm. Therefore, in the unlikely event\nof the insolvency of Investec Wealth & Investment, a liquidator would\nbe legally prevented from using clients’ assets to settle the firm’s\nliabilities.\nDeposit Protection – Client money is again clearly segregated from\nthat of the firm and is syndicated amongst a number of leading\nbanking institutions, selected for their high credit rating and level of\ncapital adequacy. This diversifies the risk of any one institution failing\nand maximises potential compensation under the FSCS.\nProfessional Indemnity (Civil Liability) Insurance – Insurance is\nmaintained against Investec’s possible negligence of up to £300m any\none claim and in all.\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 2\nWhy Investec Wealth & Investment? - Investment Process\n3\nStructured and Disciplined Investment\nProcess\nWe believe a structured and disciplined investment process is central\nto delivering consistently good risk-adjusted returns to our clients. Our\nindependent researchers and most experienced fund managers are\norganised into specialist teams to focus on three core areas: Asset\nAllocation, Stock and Sector Allocation and Collective Funds.\nActive Asset Allocation\nOur Asset Allocation Committee meets on a monthly basis to review\neconomic, interest rate and currency forecasts and the outlook for\nindividual fixed income and equity markets. Their objective is to\nproduce rolling six-month return forecasts for each market and then\nconvert these forecasts into a range of asset allocation frameworks\nwhich reflect risk tolerance and return objectives. Changes in this\nframework are reflected in changes to the composition of our client\nportfolios.\nActive Stock and Fund Selection\nOur Stock/Sector and Collective Investments Committees also meet\nregularly to review and select individual stocks and funds within each\nof the various investment markets, down to sector level within the UK\nmarket.\nThis culminates in our Recommended List of stocks and collective\nfunds, from which a dedicated fund manager then constructs and\nmonitors your portfolio, taking advantage of any tactical ideas and\n‘special situations’ from our research team that may be appropriate to\nenhance performance.\nOur research team endeavour to meet regularly face-to-face with the\nmanagement team of the companies and funds in which we invest on\nbehalf of our clients. Where possible, this is in our offices so we have\nsufficient time to ask all the questions we want answered.\nExtensive Research Capacity\nWe employ a team of dedicated researchers to provide us with\ndetailed and independent daily analysis of company results and\neconomic news.\nWe seek career analysts with an experienced and considered\nperspective, with each taking responsibility for particular economic\nsectors and areas of expertise.\nQuantitative tools, such as Quest and Factset, are used to screen and\nanalyse data as part of this process.\nWe also pay for the best external economic and company research\navailable to complement and assist our decision making.\nDetailed due diligence is undertaken on all the collective funds in\nwhich we invest, both prior to initial purchase and on an on-going\nbasis. We take an unbiased perspective, using a ‘best of breed’\napproach to select from the entire universe of onshore and offshore\nfunds. Amongst other factors, the process takes into account stability\nof the Group, access to key managers, investment process,\nperformance and volatility, quality and integrity of management.\nSpecialists cover the alternative investment arena and we tend to\navoid opaque structures, illiquid investments and highly leveraged\nsituations.\nResearch recommendations are communicated to investment\nmanagers via our daily morning meeting, a proprietary research\ndatabase and event-driven email alerts.\nDedicated Fund Manager\nWhilst structured and disciplined, our investment process is\nsufficiently flexible to enable your dedicated fund manager, in\nconjunction with your financial adviser, to interpret our house view of\nmarkets and their prospects for your benefit.\nYour dedicated fund manager will monitor the markets for you on a\ndaily basis and take immediate action on your behalf as required.\nThe final decision and responsibility for investment rests with your\nfund manager, who will be most familiar with your circumstances and\npreferences.\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 3\nWhy Investec Wealth & Investment? – Portfolio Management\n4\nBespoke and Flexible Investment Strategy\nThe asset allocation of your portfolio and its underlying holdings will\nbe designed to meet your specific objectives and attitude to risk. If\nyour circumstances or requirements change, then the portfolio can be\neasily and quickly rebalanced to meet your needs. For example, you\nmay wish to change the level of income drawn from the portfolio or\ntake a more defensive or aggressive stance.\nFlexible Minimum Investment\nRather than imposing a formal minimum investment, this is left to the\ndiscretion of your financial adviser and dedicated fund manager.\nThis flexibility allows us to offer a genuinely outsourced investment\nservice to financial advisers and their clients, rather than a service that\n‘cherry picks’ only the largest investors.\nWe are, therefore, able to offer bespoke fund management to clients\nwho are building their investments over time, as well as those who\nalready have a substantial portfolio.\nReduced Initial and Ongoing Charges on\nCollective Investments\nWhere we hold unit trusts and OEICs within a portfolio, we rebate any\ninitial commissions that are offered by the respective fund\nmanagement houses, in order to benefit clients.\nTypically, this results in a zero or very low (0.25%) initial charge,\ncompared with up to 5.25% payable as a direct retail investor.\nSimilarly, we have a policy of buying only institutional share classes of\nour preferred funds, where available; these have a much lower annual\nmanagement charge, often half that of the equivalent retail class, and\nagain all such savings are a direct benefit to clients.\nInvestment Performance Measured Against\nAgreed Benchmarks\nThe performance of all portfolios is measured against an agreed\nbenchmark, either industry recognised, such as the FTSE APCIMS\nPrivate Investor Indices, or a bespoke combination of indices\ndesigned to match the unique nature of your portfolio.\nThis comparison allows you to easily monitor if we are adding value\nand judge the consistency of relative returns over the longer term.\nTiming and Phasing of Investments\nTiming the investment of new capital can be an important determinant\nof overall returns, particularly when markets are volatile. We will work\nto an agreed strategy and can phase investments on your behalf over\na period of time as opportunities arise.\nTax Efficient Management\nWe make active and efficient use of available tax allowances,\nincluding the annual capital gains tax exemption where appropriate.\nWe will preserve the tax efficient status of any existing ISA\nwrappers, whilst seeking to use any available ISA allowance for\ncurrent and future tax years as fully as possible if requested by your\nfinancial adviser.\nWe structure family portfolios in a manner that most efficiently exploits\ndifferential marginal tax rates.\nWe also have extensive experience in the management of pension\nfunds, via our own SIPP or a host of links to third party providers, and\noffshore bond portfolios.\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 4\nWhy Investec Wealth & Investment? – Meeting Specific Requirements\n5\nInvestment Restrictions\nAs all our portfolios are bespoke to your circumstances and\npreferences, we can incorporate almost any restriction into the\nmanagement of your investments. This could mean, for example,\nretaining an existing holding, avoiding investment in a particular\ncompany or sector or placing a limit on exposure to a particular\ngeographic region or asset class.\nEthical Investment\nFrequently, we are asked to restrict investment to stocks and funds\nwhich meet high ethical and socially responsible standards.\nWhere we invest in direct equities, we are able to screen individual\nstocks according to a range of criteria.\nWe can apply negative screens, to exclude companies which, for\nexample produce alcohol, tobacco, armaments and pornography, or\nthose which are involved in animal testing or human rights abuses.\nWe can also apply positive screens, which highlight those companies\ninvolved in improving environmental, social, educational and labour\nstandards or those making significant contributions to community and\ncharitable organisations.\nWhere we invest in collectivised investments, we are able to select\nfunds with a well defined and appropriate ethical policy. We also have\na preference for fund groups that engage with companies, both within\nand outside their portfolios, in order to promote ethical and socially\nresponsible business practices.\nAlternative Investment Strategies\nWe strive to be innovative and offer a unique range of portfolios\ndesigned for clients who wish to invest exclusively in alternative\ninvestments or fixed interest securities.\nAlternative with property – investment outside traditional equity and\nfixed interest markets, under expert guidance from our research team.\nAlternative without property – investment outside traditional equity\nand fixed interest markets, under expert guidance from our research\nteam, but for clients who don’t need commercial property exposure.\nPersonal Injury and Court of Protection\nInvestec Wealth & Investment was appointed as one of two panel\nfund managers by the Department of Constitutional Affairs following a\ncompetitive tender in 2003.\nWe have built up a wealth of experience in managing investment\nportfolios for individuals with personal injury damages awards and\nthose who otherwise come under the jurisdiction of the Court of\nProtection.\nA very specific investment approach is required in order to provide a\nsteady growth in income, protect the capital value of client assets and\ncontinue to provide for long term care and support. Our extensive\nexperience in this field is vital in implementing the right strategy to\nmeet those requirements.\nCharities\nWe have over 70 years experience in managing charity portfolios of all\nsizes and currently manage over 800 mandates, placing us 3rd in the\nUK by number of segregated clients (Source: Charity Finance Survey\n2010).\nWe can provide guidance to trustees in drafting a Written Investment\nPolicy and host regular conferences to keep trustees informed of legal\nand investment developments.\nWe ensure that we don’t invest in companies that conflict with the\nobjectives of the charity and can construct a fully ethical or socially\nresponsible portfolio if required.\nWe encourage annual meetings with trustees to review performance\nand strategy.\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 5\nWhy Investec Wealth & Investment? – High Standards of Service\n6\nDedicated Fund Manager\nYour dedicated fund manager will act as a single point of contact,\nsupported by a close knit team of experienced investment and\nadministrative professionals.\nInitial and regular face-to-face meetings are encouraged, in\nconjunction with your financial adviser, to ensure we remain in close\ntouch with current and future objectives.\nNationwide Presence Means Local Contact\nWith eleven offices located across England, Scotland and Northern\nIreland, we have a truly nationwide presence that allows us to provide\nlocal contact to advisers and their clients.\nLow Staff Turnover\nWe have a very low level of staff turnover and lengthy average tenure\namongst our senior investment staff, ensuring continuity and a focus\non maintaining productive long term relationships with our clients.\nCompetitive and Transparent Charging\nStructure\nOur annual management fee is very competitive by industry standards\nand encompasses all the portfolio investments, including those held\nwithin ISA wrappers; there are no additional ‘wrapper’ fees, as levied\nby some providers.\nRather than flat percentage or tiered dealing commissions, we have a\nlow fixed contract charge of £25 per trade. This is set at a level\nrelative to our costs of settlement and administration that neither\nincentivises nor disincentivises trading activity.\nBy charging an annual fee, rather than dealing commissions, we are\nrewarded when we grow your investments, rather than by the number\nof trades we carry out. This removes the conflict of interest that can\nbe perceived to exist when a manager’s remuneration is directly linked\nto transaction volumes.\nIn Specie Transfers\nWe can transfer your existing investments to us without encashment\n(subject to the terms of your existing provider) and will not charge for\nany administrative work required to do so. This can help to minimise\nany period ‘out of the market’ when holdings are disinvested prior\nto transfer.\nReview and Consolidate Existing\nInvestments\nOur service is therefore an ideal means by which to consolidate\nexisting investments and have them reviewed and actively managed.\nIn doing so, it may be possible to diversify, reduce risk and enhance\nperformance.\nSimplified Paperwork and Reduced\nAdministrative Burden\nFor the majority of portfolios, stocks and funds are held in a\ndematerialised form in our nominee company. This greatly reduces the\ntime consuming paperwork and administrative burden that can\naccompany a portfolio held in certificated form or with a number of\ninvestment providers.\nTransactions are settled electronically and we can respond promptly\nto any corporate actions, such as rights issues and takeovers, on\nyour behalf.\nTransparent and Regular Reporting\nWe are happy to provide confirmation of every transaction undertaken\nand the rationale for doing so, enabling you to clearly understand our\ninvestment strategy and methodology.\nValuation reports are produced at six monthly intervals, providing a\nmarket view, detailed transaction statements and a summary of\nperformance over the period against agreed benchmarks.\nShortly after the end of each fiscal year, an Annual Report will be\ndespatched summarising all transactions undertaken and capital\ngains realised over the preceding twelve months.\nThe report also includes a Consolidated Tax Voucher detailing all\ndividends and interest received, plus any tax deducted at source,\nwithin the taxable element of the portfolio. These schedules are\nacceptable to HMRC and can be used to complete self assessment\nreturns.\nOnline Access via a Secure Website\nDaily updated valuations and transaction histories can be viewed\nonline via a secure website.\nIncome Collection and Cash Management\nWe maintain a deposit account on your behalf, in which we will collect\nall dividend income and interest; this can either be reinvested or\nremitted directly by wire into your nominated bank account at a\nfrequency to suit your requirements.\nWe also offer a cash management service whereby, based upon the\nprojected annual income of your portfolio, fixed monthly payments\ncan be made, assisting you in budgeting.\nFree Payment by Wire or BACS\nIf you draw a regular income from your portfolio or decide to withdraw\ncapital at any time, then all payments are made free of charge by\neither wire or BACS.\nFlexibility to Access Capital\nWith no exit penalties or lock-up periods, monies can generally be\nmade available in five working days, should you need them to meet a\nplanned or unforeseen requirement, although most strategies should\nbe viewed as long-term investments.\nPast performance of an investment is no guide to its\nperformance in the future. Investments, or income from them,\ncan go down as well as up. You may not necessarily get back\nthe amount you invested.\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 6\nThis page is intentionally blank\n7\nST00037289_Investec_IWI175 14/08/2012 11:02 Page 7\nIWI175 v3 08/12\nMember firm of the London Stock Exchange.

Russell's character brings her \"home\" to his messy house and unruly kids and the laughs follow as the aristocratic Hawn tries fitting in. Marshall delivers the comic goods, the leads are entertaining (Russell needs to do more comedy) and the supporting cast is made up of happily familiar faces, including Roddy McDowall, Edward Herrmann, and Marshall favourite Hector Elizondo in an unbilled bit part. --Tom Keogh From Amazon.co.uk.\nOther Items Similar to Overboard [1987]\nHousesitter [1992]\nDVD Bird On A Wire [1990]\nDVD Death Becomes Her/Bird on a Wire/Housesitter\nDVD Death Becomes Her [1992]\nDVD Big Business\nDVD Captain Ron\nDVD\ndvd menu\nAction DVDs\nChildren's DVDs\nComedy DVDs\nDrama DVDs\nMusic DVDs\nSport DVDs\nTV DVDs\nindex\nother spots\ncar insurance\nmobile phones\nexperiences\ncredit cards\nloans\ngifts\ncentral site\ncheap cds\ncheap dvds\ncheap blu-rays\ncheap games\ncheap books\ncheap mobiles\nscoop 6\nSearch for  in All Categories\nAction\nBallet & Dance\nChildren's\nClassic Films\nClassic Music\nComedy\nDrama\nHorror\nInternational\nMusic\nMusicals & Stage\nOpera\nSci-Fi\nSport\nTV"],

Mazda Mazda5 Review\nSHARPLY styled and engineered with fun in mind, Mazda has a new family sized people mover on the way.\nThe new Mazda5 will be on sale in a couple of weeks and we have just had a preview of the new petrol engined models – albeit in left hand drive form.\nA 1.6-litre diesel version will be coming on stream in the New Year and that will be capable of averaging 54 miles per gallon with CO2 emissions of 138g/km.\nInitially, Mazda will be rolling out its new seven seater with a choice of either 1.8-litre 115PS engines or a leaner two-litre developing 150PS and fitted with a stop/start system.\nThe two-litre can average a claimed 40.9mpg with a CO2 rating of 159g/km squeezing below the 160g/km threshold to attract fleet and business users.\nThe 1.8, although the cheapest in the range priced from £17,695, is not quite as eco friendly averaging 39.2mpg with emissions of 168.\nFeaturing Mazda’s new Nagare design theme the Mazda5 is out to cut a dash.\nThe style is characterised by wave effect body cuts which run along the side of the vehicle but their appearance may not be everyone’s cup of tea and certainly work best in lighter paint finishes.\nWith darker paint jobs the style loses some of its impact and from certain angles gives a crinkled appearance.\nFrom the front the Mazda5 has a bold stance having inherited the heavily sculpted nose and prominent grille first seen on the latest Mazda3 hatch.\nAt the back the rear lamps now stretch horizontally into the tailgate as opposed to the vertical set up on the previous generation and all in all it looks much more contemporary than before.\nFor a people mover the Mazda5 handles well. Uprated dampers and suspension have given it plenty of feel when cornering while on the cruise it is well composed – much more car-like than MPV.\nThere is also a reassuring amount of feedback through the steering and while engine noise is well contained there is some wind rush – especially on the two-litre model.\nNo automatic option is being offered and both engines use six speed manual gearboxes which help produce more than adequate performance.\nTop speed in the two-litre is 120mph with 0 to 60 taking 11 seconds and the 1.8 can hit 113mph taking 12.8 seconds from standstill to 60.\nThe two-litre models will cost from £18,895 with top range Sport versions priced from £20,195.\nAcross the range all Mazda5s will come with electronic stability controls, alloy wheels, air conditioning and cruise control.\nEventually an integrated TomTom navigation unit complete with Bluetooth connectivity will be available as an option, although prices have still to be announced.\nAs a competitor to the likes of the Vauxhall Zafira, Citroen C4 Picasso and the VW Touran, the Mazda5 stands up well although it will face stiff competition from the new Ford Grand C-Max.\nPeople movers in this day and age score when it comes to flexibility and the Mazda5 is definitely well equipped in this department.\nPower operated sliding doors make access to the middle and rear seats easier than with conventional doors and Mazda’s karakuri fast fold system means the car can be converted from seven seater to load lugger of minivan proportions in less than a minute.\nThe seating configuration can also be varied as required and with the middle seats capable of sliding the Mazda5 is positively spacious inside when set up as a four seater.\nWith all seats in play luggage space is restricted to a couple of overnight bags but as a four seater there is a very usable 426 litres of space extending to 1,566 with all seats folded flat.\nThe ability to slide forward the middle seats also creates sufficient leg room for adults to fit in the back and comfort throughout the vehicle is above par.\nSteering wheel mounted controls for the audio and trip computer and a smartly styled instrument panel have created quite a sportscar like feel from the driving seat.\nThe stop/start system on the two-litre engine works well operating without fuss and Mazda is claiming it reduces CO2 emissions by 15 per cent compared to the previous model.\nThe diesels are due on sale in January and will be priced from £20,195 to £21,495.\nAuthor: Chris Russon\nOther Mazda Mazda5 Reviews\nMazda5 2.0 TS2\nIT used to be a case that the words “people carrier” conjured up images of b..\nSeven into 5 does go\nAN already frugal but powerful petrol engine plus stop/start makes the latest Ma..\nMazda5 Sport\nSTRANGE as it may sound but it must have been my young and impressionable period..\nMazda5 2.0 MZR Sport\nSINCE they first emerged around the mid 1990s in the guise of the Ford Galaxy an..\nOther New Cars by Mazda\nMazda 2 ,\nMazda 3 ,\nMazda 323 ,\nMazda 5 ,\nMazda 6 ,\nMazda Cx-7 ,\nMazda Demio ,\nMazda Mx-5 ,\nMazda Rx-8\nPrivacy and Cookie Policy\nOverall Score:\n(\n0\n)\nAdd your rating:\nNew mazda Brochures\nCity Cars\nSmall Cars\nSmall Family Cars\nLarge Family Cars\nLuxury Cars\nSmall MPVs\nLarge MPVs\n4x4s\nSports & GTs\nVans\nDisclaimer\nSite Map\nImportant legal notice\nThe information on this site is subject to a disclaimer and a copyright notice.\n©2000 - 2011 SDO Media.

Like it's big brother (Epson PP-100). The Epson PP-50 is an enclosed system. It has one single recorder and the same inbuilt, full colour inkjet printer. This means the Epson PP50 still produces the same quality of print and recording as the PP-100 and is still one of the easiest systems to setup and use. If you need multiple job queuing with high quality print and you're doing lots of small quantity duplication then this is a great place to start..\nOffering an ideal combination of quality and economy, the Discproducer PP-50 delivers accurate burning and photo-realistic printing with a low cost per unit. Thanks to Epson’s individual inks system, the cost of each produced media is low as you only need to replace the colour used and, depending on the print image, you can produce over 1,000 fully covered discs from one set of cartridges. The Discproducer PP-50 automatically stops printing until it’s replaced to avoid mis-prints.\nThe included software is user-friendly too, with pre-defined templates and images, so you don’t need to be an expert to use it. One of the smallest disc publishing solutions on the market, the fully-stackable\nThe Epson Discproducer PP-50 has a compact footprint and measures only 38cm wide to fit easily onto a shelf or desktop.\nFull Epson PP-50 PC / MAC Requirements\nSupported Operating systems: Windows XP SP2 or later, Home/Professional, Windows 2000 SP4 or later, Professional, CPU: Pentium 4, 1.4 GHz or higher Memory:, 512 Mbytes or larger, HDD: 10 Gbytes or larger, 7200 rpm or more, Graphics environment: XGA, or more 65536 colors or more, Sound environment:, A sound device and a supported driver must be, installed for music media, USB 2.0 (High-speed), USB port: This product cannot be used in USB port, of the PC equipped with some ATI's chipset as, follows: ATI’s Southbridge IXP (SB)460 or earlier, Individual published performance results may vary, depending on processing capacity of PC.

The full course can also be run as an adventure holiday, or as part of an ordinary holiday with an extreme activity included. Both the Accelerated Freefall (AFF) and Tandem courses are run by British Parachuting Association instructors, with years of experience, and are mainly run in the UK, Spain, Florida and California. Our equipment is the latest available, and specially design for the job. Whether it's a full AFF or Tandem course you will experience the thrill of freefall in a safe and friendly environment.  Any AFF course will require a full days training before jumping with two experienced instructors and your own parachute, however for a Tandem course you could be attached to an instructor and ready to go after a 30 minute briefing. For either course you will be freefalling for 50 seconds from 13,000ft !\nPhoto by Mike Gorman                                               Photo by Tony Danbury Photos By Mike Gorman\nEmpuriabrava 1...\nBy Mike Gorman\nBook Preview\nLast Updated on Thursday, 03 November 2011 17:02\n \naceskydiving.co.uk, Powered by Joomla!; Joomla templates by SG web hosting"],

It wasn't a BMW 3 Series or an Audi A4 - but it wasn't far off and didn't cost nearly as much.\nOn the used market, that appeal still holds good. If you don't care about pin-sharp handling but want a classy, prestigious small saloon or estate at an affordable price, this could be just what's required.\nModels\nModels Covered:\nS40 4-door saloon: 1.6, 1.8, 1.8GDI, 2.0, 2.0T, 1.9T4, 2.0T4,1.9 turbo diesel, 1.9D,1.9D 115 [base, S, XS, SE, CD]\nHistory\nThis car was originally christened the S4 - and, indeed, was originally displayed at the 1995 London motor show as such. That was before Audi stepped in and threatened legal action over the use of a title already being used on their sporting models. Given that Ingolstadt was providing turbo diesels for the larger 850 range, Gothenburg could hardly argue.\nSo the car became the S40 - or V40 for the estate version. In actual fact, the term 'estate' was a rather generous one; this was one of those so-called 'lifestyle estates', without the grandfather clock-capacity of Volvo's larger station wagon models. Nevertheless, it was a lot more practical than alternatives from BMW and Audi.\nThe S/V40 itself, like the 400 series before it, was built not in Sweden but in Holland where it rolled down the same production line as Mitsubishi's mechanically similar Carisma. Initially, the range was launched with just two petrol engines of 1.8 and 2.0-litres in size.\nIn December 1996, a turbo diesel version arrived with the same 1.9-litre Renault engine found in the Laguna and previously used in the 440 range. In April 1997, this was followed by a new entry-level 1.6-litre petrol model. In Autumn, the flagship T4 version was launched with a turbocharged 1.9-litre engine and potent performance.\nBut Volvo hadn't stopped there. The first few months of 1998 saw two further petrol models launched - the light pressure turbocharged 2.0T and the Mitsubishi-made Gasoline Direct Injection 1.8-litre GDi, which aimed to combine diesel economy with petrol performance.\nIn Spring 1999, a new direct injection 1.9-litre diesel replaced the old TD unit (but wasn't much quieter). In July, the range was improved with the addition of Volvo's clever WHIPS anti-whiplash system to protect occupants in rear-end collisions.\n'Phase II' models were introduced in mid-2000 with new engines and transmissions, retuned chassis, upgraded specifications and additional safety features. You'll pick these cars by subtly restyled bumpers and side marker lamps, double-lens headlamps, new tail lamps and restyled alloy wheels. Redesigned air conditioner and stereo controls nestled in a new centre console.\nThe petrol T4 versions had their capacity increased from 1.9 to two litres and a pair of 'common rail' turbo diesels replaced the earlier engine. All two-litre petrol engines now had the option of the V70's new five-speed automatic transmission. The ride and handling were improved by widening the front track by 18mm to allow larger tyres to be fitted and by extending the wheelbase 12mm. In 2001 Volvo launched Bi-Fuel LPG models across the S and V40 ranges. A Sport Lux model was introduced in late 2001, combining the luxury of the SE spec with the racy looks of the Sport variant. Available with all engines bar the T4, the Sport Lux's pricing saw it run into the bottom end of the premium sector.\nIn early 2003 a series of changes saw the 200bhp T4 and the 102bhp turbo diesel engine dropped from the range. At the same time prices were massaged downwards and equipment was boosted. All models got leather trim and those that already had it gained an electric driver's seat. Sport and Sport Lux versions also received white side repeaters, bigger 17-inch alloy wheels and sports dials.\nWhat You Get\nA cultured car that in second-hand form makes a good alternative to a new Focus or Astra. The 2.0-litre petrol engine is the best bet but do try the excellent 2.0T version which is harder to find.\nThree basic trim levels were offered initially - base, SE and CD with S and XS arriving later - and to those an almost endless range of option packs could be offered. Standard equipment on all models stretched to power steering, ABS, SIPS (the Side Impact Protection System), a driver's airbag with seatbelt pre-tensioners, colour co-ordinated body mouldings and mirrors, an immobiliser, electric front windows and powered mirrors.\nTo this, the SE versions add a glass tilting/sliding sunroof, remote control for the central locking, an alarm with deadlocks, a trip computer and cruise control. Finally, CD specifications run to 'burr wood' trim, air conditioning, leather-faced seats, electric rear windows and a better quality stereo with a CD multichanger.\nWhat You Pay\nThe earliest N-registered 1.8-litre S40s start from around Â£700 if you can find one. You'll more likely come across P-registered models at around Â£500 up to 2000 X-platers under Â£1,500. You'll also find more recent cars with S and XS trim and a 1.6-litre engine was available from 97P registration with used prices starting from about Â£600.\nBear in mind that many owners will have purchased one of the many option packs available to spec-up their cars. Effectively, there are five main ones; 'Handling', 'Comfort', 'Luxury', 'Winter' and 'Business'. There's also an audio upgrade and the option of sports suspension. Fitment of these in any combination could account for quite large variance from these figures. If in doubt, find out which packs and/or accessories are fitted, get hold of a current accessory brochure and make your own calculations.\nWhat to Look For\nTry and avoid the earliest N-registered cars; it took Volvo several months to get the quality right on a large number of them. Stretch if you can to a 2.0-litre model rather than the 1.6 or 1.8, the latter is limited by very tall gearing; it just doesn't pull very strongly in 5th.\nThe turbo diesel is also worth avoiding, unless fuel economy really is your top priority, in which case have a look at the rare 1.8GDI petrol model . The diesels are noisy and slow though the later direct injection engines were better. On the other hand, the 2.0T and T4 models are superb and will surprise many BMW and Audi devotees.\nReplacement Parts\n(approx. based on a 2.0SE) A clutch assembly is around Â£245. Front brake pads are around Â£55, a full exhaust about Â£400, a catalyst about Â£520 and an alternator around Â£170. A headlamp lens is about Â£40.\nOn the Road\nThe mainstream 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre engines are willing, though the 1.6 and 1.8 lack torque. The handling too, could be sharper but is good enough to raise new standards for small Volvos. The T4 model is very quick in a straight line, but a touch turbulent in the twisty bits.\nNor has Volvo forgotten it's old raison d'etre, safety. In fact, it claims to have broken new ground for cars of this class, having fitted as standard its SIPS (Side Impact Protection System) airbags in the sides of the front seat backrests. These play a crucial part in minimising side impact injuries. The front suspension too, has been designed to prevent the front wheels from protruding into the footwells in an accident - a common cause of foot and ankle injuries.\nOverall\nThe Volvo badge and that three-year warranty could, with all the other attributes we've touched on, finally persuade you to buy into the Gothenburg marque. On the strength of this car, many new buyers already have.\nUsed Car Search\nin association with\nPostcode:\nPlease enter a Postcode\nMake:\nAlfa Romeo\nAston Martin\nAudi\nBentley\nBMW\nCadillac\nCaterham\nChevrolet\nChrysler\nCitroen\nDaewoo\nDaihatsu\nDodge\nFerrari\nFiat\nFord\nHonda\nHummer\nHyundai\nInfiniti\nIsuzu\nJaguar\nJeep\nKia\nLada\nLamborghini\nLancia\nLand Rover\nLexus\nLotus\nMaserati\nMaybach\nMazda\nMercedes-Benz\nMG\nMINI\nMitsubishi\nMorgan\nNissan\nNoble\nPerodua\nPeugeot\nPorsche\nProton\nRenault\nRolls-Royce\nRover\nSaab\nSEAT\nSkoda\nSmart\nSsangYong\nSubaru\nSuzuki\nToyota\nTVR\nVauxhall\nVolkswagen\nVolvo\nModel:\nLatest News\nToyota FT-86 Open concept\nNew SEAT Mii Ecofuel\nHyundai expands its i40 range\nSee more News\nÂ \nBiggleswade Today Recommends\nBack to the top of the page\nNews\nSport\nWhat's On\nWeather\nPlace your Ad\nSubscribe\nSpecial Features\nDeals\nShop\nHolidays\nDating\nBingo\nBuy A Photo\nLocal news on the move\nKeep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.\nVisit this website on your mobile to start enjoying it on the move.\nSubscribe to the Biggleswade Today\nGet your favourite newspaper at a great low price.\nCall us on 0844 292 0216 or click here\nto start your subscription today!\nNewsletter sign up\nNewsletter sign up\nContact us\nIf you wish, you can contact us using any of the methods below.\n7 High Street\nBiggleswade\nEngland\nBedfordshire\nSG18 0JB\nEmail: editorial@biggleswadechronicle.co.uk\nTelephone: 01767 222333\nFAQs\nTerms and Conditions\nDisclaimer\nCookies Policy\nSwitch to Mobile Site\nAll rights reserved\nÂ© 2013 Johnston Publishing Ltd.\nThis website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissionâs Code of Practice.

Your Lower Hardres Best rate Removals Deals partner is committed to ensuring they will do everything possible to make it hassle-free, Often they provide extra services including additional packing and storage services, and are happy to provide moving advice, but as always it is good to check first direct with them to see what services they are able to offer.\nPrepare your Lower Hardres move in advanced\nWhen you move house, you will have to arrange many things in advance. It is always a good idea to make a list of the things you have to do. Start collecting together as much packing material as you think you will need. Also give some thought to the furniture and other items that you want to move, and if any, the items you are leaving behind.\nBoxes for moving?\nSpeak to your Lower Hardres Best Rate Removals Deals partner and they will advise you how and where you can obtain moving boxes in order help the whole moving process move forward as easily as possible.\nWhat to take and what to leave in your Lower Hardres move?\nYou will not necessarily want to take everything with you. Make a list of the things you are taking with you. It is also useful to have a list when you are unpacking.\nRemovals van access in your Lower Hardres move\nAlways give some thought to how the removals van or removal vans can access, not only the house you are moving from, but the house you are moving to; it might be necessary to advise your neighbours that the van will be parking outside your house as their cooperation might be helpful. Do not forget that you are responsible for obtaining any permits for parking if it is appropriate for your area.\nSketch a plan of your Lower Hardres move\nIf it is quite a bit smaller than your present property for example, you will need to leave some things behind and not bring it with you. If you start packing sensibly based on how you are planning to unpack in your new home, and with some idea of where the items are going, then moving in will be much easier.\nPacking for your Lower Hardres move\nYou can order a professional packing service from your removal company if you have many fragile or valuable objects, it is a good idea to check with your Best Rate Removals Deals Company about this service, and they will be delighted to advise you of what then can do for you. Or perhaps you will decide to pack yourself. If this is the case, and you choose to pack yourself, you should give yourself plenty of time, and start packing your items some weeks before your moving day. Make sure you go through everything systematically. Make lists, tick things off. Label the moving boxes clearly, record what is inside them. Remember to pack the essential items you will need only before your move! Don't overcrowd and over-pack a moving box, also it is not a good idea to under-fill either.\nPrior to your Lower Hardres move, notify utility companies.\nElectric, gas, and water companies should be notified in advance in advance. Obviously as you are changing your address, you will have to notify them; do not forget also to advise your bank, GP practice, opticians, and dentist. Notify your employer, and if you have any children, you will have had to given some serious thought to changing their schools if the move is a significant distance away.\nMoney, valuables, jewellery and personal documents\nAs it is quite conceivable that you might need these items during the removal, or perhaps while they are in storage. Also do not pack essential items that you will need right after you move in, always keep track of where you are putting things.\nBe there on the moving day!\nTo ensure that everything goes smoothly as planned with the removal team, it is important to be present on the moving day.\nProperty checks in Lower Hardres\nEnsure that you have not left anything behind. Also turn off electricity and gas, and close all the windows.\nRemovals FAQ's:\nI live in the area but why should I consider Best Rate Removals Deals?\nYour Best Rate Removals Deal partner will give you a no hassle extremely competitive quote, with the service you would expect from a reliable trusted local removal company.\nHow does your service differ from using a \"price comparison web site\"?\nWe have tried so called comparison sites in the past, and found that by far the majority of them simply do no more than email your details to any enlisted removal companies they have encouraged to buy leads from them. Comparison sites therefore are mostly lead suppliers, your details as a \"lead\" is charged to each of the receiving removal companies.\nAs you now are a lead and have cost the Removals company money, you will be contacted vigorously by all the participating Removal companies' sales teams. You can see for comparison sites the more removals companies they have on board the better for them, as they will receive the lead fee many times over for your referral. However for you it's not so convenient, this process in variably involves you taking multiple phone calls from sales teams of many differing\nRemovals companies desperate to make the \"lead\" work for them. In order to \"compare\" it would not be unusual to expect potentially multiple site visits from them all in order for them all to prepare surveys necessary for preparing quotes. If you don't like the sound of that, why not try our new innovative service We believe we can simplify the process at Best Rate Removals Deals, we have done some homework and have partnered with one local reputable company who pass our selection criteria, and who are dedicated to giving you a great service at a very competitive price Without the hassle; with us you are not a lead but a valued customer.\nDo any comparison sites provide email quotes?\nWe have seen a few, and they are in the minority; it is interesting that if instant quotes are provided they are normally described as provisional, and as such you are normally informed that these quotes provided are not Binding! Also still expect your enquiry to be followed up with multiple sales call's in any case.\nHow soon can I expect contact from the \"Best Rate Removals Deals \"Partner?\nAs soon as possible, normally within the same working day.\nAre the Best Rate Removals Deals partner's quotes without obligation?\nAbsolutely there is no obligation, just get a great quote, the rest is up to you.\nWhile the goods are being moved Are Your Best Rate Removals Partners covered by insurance?\nYes this is one of the strict requirements of being the Best rate Removal partner.\nHow much does it cost to move?\nOur Best Rate Removals Deal Partner will be able to tell you when they provide you with a no obligation quote. It will depend on a number of things, for example the size of your house, and of course where you are moving to.\nWhat additional services do your best rate removals partners provide in ?\nBest Rate Removals Partners are always delighted to explain the services they are able to perform and to advice you of the costs if necessary in advance.\nWhere can I see the \"Best Rate Removals Deals\" partners own website\nOur Link from our pages will take you straight to them.\n© 2013 Best Rate Removals Deals Ltd v2.1\nTerms & Conditions | \nPrivacy Policy | \nSitemap  | \nFAQ  | \nAbout Debt"],

Accommodation\n \nTo download a Certificate Of Fitness / Private Tenancies form, please click on the link below.\nCertificate of Fitness / Private Tenancies application form\nNotes to accompany application form\nThe Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 was introduced on 1 April 2007 which provides a new structure for the private rented sector in Northern Ireland.\nSome of the main features of this are:\nNew tenancies are defined according to their fitness for human habitation – an unfit tenancy will be subject to rent control until it is made fit\nDistrict Councils are responsible for inspecting tenancies for fitness and have been given new powers to ensure that unfitness and serious disrepair are addressed.\nControlled rents are now based on a number of factors including the condition of the property, the equivalent Housing Executive rent for a similar dwelling and the general level of rents in the area.\nRestricted and regulated tenancies will retain their protection.  Existing tenants will have a tenancy for life but there will only be one further succession possible rather than two as at present.\nThere are to be no more protected tenancies.  On vacancy, all currently protected tenancies will be decontrolled.  If the property is rented out subsequently, the rent is not subject to control, as long as the property is fit.  As a result, whether a tenancy is furnished or unfurnished no longer has any significance.\nAs well as having rent books, new tenants have to be supplied with a written statement of the terms of their tenancy.  Where a tenancy agreement fails to clarify repairing obligations, the law provides default terms.\nPurpose\nThe new system rewards the efforts of landlords who wish to provide good quality housing for their tenants and remove restrictions which would hamper the development of good quality, privately rented housing.  Protected tenants retain their security of tenure.  \nImpact of Private Tenancies Order on Existing Registered Regulated Tenancies\nThe provisions of the Rent Order which allowed for annual increases (Article 33) were repealed on 1 April 2007.  As a result the current registered rent for regulated tenancies will not change.\nFor any increase to be applied after 1 April 2007, a landlord must apply to the Rent Officer for Northern Ireland under the provisions of the Private Tenancies Order 2006 which came into effect on 1 April 2007.\nIf a tenancy is currently registered as regulated and:\nWas built after 1945, or\nHad a regulated rent certificate issued within the past 10 years, or\nHad a renovation grant paid by the Housing Executive within the past 10 years, or\nHad an HMO grant paid within the past 10 years\nNo fitness inspection is required and the landlord can apply direct to the Rent Officer to set a new rent.\nIf a current regulated tenancy does not fall into one of the above categories, the landlord can still apply direct to the Rent Officer but the new rent determined will be based on the assumption that the property does not meet the fitness standard.  In order to maximise the rent that can be charged, the landlord will need to apply to the district council for a fitness inspection after 1 April 2007.  Landlords should contact their district council environmental health department for further information.\nApplication Process\nUnder the Private Tenancies Order, the landlord of a private tenancy commencing after 1 April 2007 of a property which was built before 1 January 1945 must have a fitness inspection conducted by the district council, unless it is exempt (see below).\nThe following properties are exempt from this requirement if:\n• A Renovation Grant was paid by the Housing Executive within the past 10 years\n• An HMO grant was paid by the Housing Executive within the past 10 years\n• The dwelling is currently registered as an HMO with the Housing Executive\n• A regulated rent certificate was issued by the district council within the past 10 years.\nAlthough protected and statutory tenancies are not new tenancies, a fitness inspection is necessary (unless one of the exemptions applies) if the landlord wishes to maximise the amount of rent he can lawfully charge.\nOnce the Application form is completed by the landlord with the appropriate fee currently £50.00, an EHO will visit the property and carry out a fitness inspection .\nFitness inspections\nIf the property meets the fitness standard, the district council will issue a certificate of fitness. Unless the tenancy is a protected or statutory tenancy, this means that no rent control will apply to the tenancy and the landlord is free to charge a market rent.\nIn the case of a protected or statutory tenancy, a copy of the certificate of fitness will be sent to the Rent Officer for Northern Ireland who will determine an appropriate rent, taking into account the fitness of the dwelling. This rent will be the maximum which can be charged unless there is a change of circumstances.\nIf the district council is not satisfied that the dwelling meets the fitness standard it will issue the landlord and tenant with a notice of refusal. This notice will state the reasons for refusal, and will also indicate the works which in the opinion of the council will be necessary for the dwelling to meet the fitness standard. A copy of the notice of refusal will be sent to the Rent Officer for Northern Ireland who will determine an appropriate rent, taking into account   the unfitness of the dwelling. This rent will be the maximum which can be charged until the dwelling is brought up to the fitness standard.\nOnce the necessary work has been completed, the landlord must make a second application to the council for a certificate of fitness. A second fee of £100 is charged by the district council.\nIf a certificate of fitness is issued, a copy will be sent to the Rent Officer for Northern Ireland. If the tenancy is a protected or statutory tenancy, the landlord or tenant can apply to the rent officer to have a new rent determined. If the tenancy is not a protected or statutory tenancy, the tenancy will be removed from the rent register and no further rent control will apply.\nTenant’s subsequent application for a fitness inspection\nOnce a certificate of fitness has been issued, the tenant can apply for a re-inspection at any time if there are grounds for believing that the property no longer meets the fitness standard. A fee of £50.00 will be charged for this inspection.\nTenants should contact us for further information.\nIf a notice of refusal is issued as a result, this will be sent to the Rent Officer for Northern Ireland. If the tenancy is a protected or statutory tenancy, the landlord or tenant can apply to the rent officer to have a new rent determined. If the tenancy is not a protected or statutory tenancy, the rent officer will determine an appropriate rent.\nGuidance\nPlease download the following for further guidance:\n‘Private Tenancies - A guide for Private Landlords and Tenants in Northern Ireland’\n‘Protected and Statutory Tenancies - A guide for Private Landlords and Tenants in Northern Ireland’\nSee Harassment and Illegal Eviction section for the ‘Protection against Harassment and Illegal Eviction - A guide for Private Landlords and Tenants in Northern Ireland’\n‘Repairing Obligations - A guide for Private Landlords and Tenants in Northern Ireland’\nTemplate for a rent book (after 1st April 2007)\nTemplate for a rent book (Pre April 2007)\nStatement of Tenancy term\nOther Useful Websites\nRent Officer’s website: www.rentofficer-ni.gov.uk\nDepartment for Social Development: www.dsdni.gov.uk/index/hsdiv-housing\nIn This Section\nOverview\nBiodiversity\nConsumer Protection\nHealthy Eating\nHousing Advice To Landlords\nBurst Pipes\nDamp\nDrains And Sewers\nHarrassment And Illegal Eviction\nMould And Condensation\nOil Leaks\nPrivate Tenancies\nPest Control\nPollution Control\nServices\nSmoke Free Legislation\nSustainability\nWater Quality\nAnimal Welfare\nCurrent News\nFlooding Advice\nFood Hygiene and Safety\nFood Hygiene Rating Scheme\nFood Safety Week\nHealth and Safety\nInfection control\nOccupational Health and Safety\nUrgent gas cooker warning\nWHEAP\n \nOmagh District Council, The Grange, Mountjoy Road, Omagh, Co.

Many of these were based on a close observation of nature.\nÂ  Â  Â \nThe Liberty works at Merton Abbey Mills in south London produced beautiful block-printed silks by hand. These made Arthur Liberty, who opened theÂ LibertyÂ department store in London in 1875, an important figure in the arts and crafts movement, which rejected the mass-produced workmanship of the industrial age. They supplied beautiful materials for dresses and decorating the house, but in quantities and at a price that made them available to the wider general public.\nIn March 1856, William Perkin created a purple dye (aniline) from coal tar. This was the first artificial dye and it became extremely popular among textile manufacturers because it was cheaper and easier to produce than natural dyes.\nThe weekly Punch magazine was founded on 17th July 1841. It helped to coin the term 'cartoon' in its modern sense as a comic drawing by printing illustrations that mocked the news at the time.\nSilhouette portrait pictures cut from thin black card became a cheap and novelty way of sharing a picture of yourself with others.Â \nOn the 23rd September 1840, William Fox Talbot invented the calotype positive/negative process for using light sensitive photographic paper to produce photographs.\nIn 1859, Francis Frith opened the firm of Francis Frith & Co.Â in Surrey, the world's first specialist photographic publisher.Â He embarked on the enormous project of photographing all the notable historical or interesting sights across the UK and within a few years over two thousand shops were selling postcards with his photos on them. Many of these were printed in a reddish-brown colour called sepia.\nIn 1843 the first Christmas card was created and sent, designed by John Calcott Horsley. A thousand copies of the card were printed and sold for one shilling, starting an annual tradition.\nMany factory towns began to build new, grand town halls. Manchester Town Hall was completed in 1877. It is designed in a style called 'neo-gothic', based on the cathedrals and churches of the Medieval period.\nSign in|Report Abuse|Print Page|Remove Access|Powered By Google Sites"],

The Osmonds exposed thousands of teenage girls to a way of life they never knew existed. Here was a group of clean cut, all American boys with mega-watt smiles and winning personalities.\nThey were shortly followed by a pair of young missionaries that my mother invited into the house because she knew no different. They were lovely wholesome chaps but were on a hiding to nothing in a house full of atheists.\nFast forward to the 21st century and the advent of The Book of Mormon, the anarchic, un-PC musical which has split the London critics over whether it is the most over-hyped show on earth or a must see production.\nI bought a ticket months ago, before the media hysteria, but had to first undergo a grilling at the box office by an earnest young man who feared that I didnât know what I was letting myself in for.\nIâm glad I held my guns. I hate to go against authorised opinion but I started laughing seconds into the performance (at The Prince of Wales Theatre in the heart of the West End) and my jaw was aching painfully by the interval.\nItâs one of the most original, irreligious and outrageous musicals since Jerry Springer. I havenât laughed so much in years.\nItâs penned by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park and if you love their sense of humour then youâll enjoy BoM - and there is the divide. This isnât for you if youâre easily offended.\nGavin Creel and Jared Gertner, as Mormon missionaries Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, have come over from the Broadway production to star in the London show and they made a convert out of me.\nCreel plays the pin-up boy for the cause to perfection, right down to his dazzling smile and winning personality.\nIn a cruel twist of circumstance, he is lumbered with the class dunce who hero worships him and is blessed with a vivid imagination. Gertner sounds like Kermitâs nephew, Robin, but heâs the archetypal nerd â plump, bespectacled, and sporting a head of less than angelic curls.\nThe couple have just completed basic training and, while their friends get dream assignments in Paris, Japan etc they get Uganda where a warlord is forcing women to be circumcised and life is beyond tough for the mission in the field.\nThereâs a tremendous sound-track and a lot of incredibly offensive jokes â which I loved. There were a pair of genuine Mormons sitting in my row and at first, because they were dressed identically to the cast on stage, I thought they were part of the production, but they were fee-paying punters who also seemed to enjoy most of the gags.\nThe Book of Mormon affectionately offends just about everyone at some point, but obviously the Mormon Church in the main. The church has taken it in good part and even taken out advertising in the programme. I canât imagine some religions being so forgiving or blessed with a sense of humour.\nThis musical is the nemesis of Joseph and Jesus Christ Superstar but it is such a breath of fresh air in an industry choking on saccharine-sweet family-friendly, bubblegum shows.\nIâd love to see it again and Iâd recommend it to everyone (except your granny and the under 14s) but itâs almost impossible to get tickets for this year unless youâre willing to pay Â£127 for a standard seat. The cheaper seats are probably long gone.\nLay siege to the box office 0844 482 5136 or visit www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk to see what you can get.\n@LBOanne.\nEmail to a friend\nPrint this page\nTop stories\nJim Marshall honoured with plaque unveiling\nWolverton Town Band in tune with new director\nLunchtime clarinet classics performance\nPearl Handled Revolver announce launch of new album\nAmy Wadge and Coal Porters set for Buckingham shows this week\nLifestyle\nLocal Services\nLocal Entertainment\nEvents & Exhibitions\nDigital Editions\nBlogs\nShowbiz\nMotoring\nBingo\nReader Travel\nBuy A Photo\nDating\nLocal Entertainment\nGig Guide\nWhat's On\nÂ \nPopular\nMost comments\nMost shared\nMan hit by train in Bicester\nNew Sainsburyâs and health centre plan\nUniversity of Buckingham pays tribute to Margaret Thatcher\nMan faces sexual assault charges\nExciting times for town fitness facilities\nPaydayUK raises Â£1,500 for Dogs for the Disabled\nDepression drug citalopram heart warning\nHorse burgers could be recycled\nSouth Northants cyclists honoured at launch of Cycle 4 Cynthia 2013\nSir Tony speaks out against same-sex marriage in debate\nSearch for:\n(Plumber, Taxi, McDonalds...)\nWhere?\n(town, county etc.)\n\"Business owner? - Claim your business and Advertise with us\"\nIn association with\nLooking for...\nFeatured advertisers\nJobs\nSearch for a job\nKeywords:\nSearch\nMotors\nSearch for a car\nMake\nModel\nAny Model\nPrice from\nÂ£0\nÂ£500\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£20,000\nÂ£10,000\nÂ£11,000\nÂ£12,000\nÂ£13,000\nÂ£14,000\nÂ£15,000\nÂ£16,000\nÂ£17,000\nÂ£18,000\nÂ£19,000\nÂ£22,500\nÂ£27,500\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£35,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£75,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£250,000\nPrice to\nÂ£500\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£20,000\nÂ£10,000\nÂ£11,000\nÂ£12,000\nÂ£13,000\nÂ£14,000\nÂ£15,000\nÂ£16,000\nÂ£17,000\nÂ£18,000\nÂ£19,000\nÂ£22,500\nÂ£27,500\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£35,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£75,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£500,000\nSearch\nProperty\nSearch for a house\nBuy\nRent\nBedrooms\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5+\nPrice from\nunder Â£30,000\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£60,000\nÂ£70,000\nÂ£80,000\nÂ£90,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£125,000\nÂ£150,000\nÂ£175,000\nÂ£200,000\nÂ£225,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£275,000\nÂ£300,000\nÂ£325,000\nÂ£350,000\nÂ£375,000\nÂ£400,000\nÂ£425,000\nÂ£450,000\nÂ£475,000\nÂ£500,000\nÂ£550,000\nÂ£600,000\nÂ£650,000\nÂ£700,000\nÂ£800,000\nÂ£900,000\nÂ£1,000,000\nÂ£1,500,000\nÂ£2,000,000\nÂ£3,000,000\nPrice from\nÂ£200\nÂ£300\nÂ£400\nÂ£500\nÂ£600\nÂ£700\nÂ£800\nÂ£900\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£1,250\nÂ£1,500\nÂ£1,750\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£2,250\nÂ£2,500\nÂ£2,750\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£3,500\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£4,500\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£10,000\nPrice to\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£60,000\nÂ£70,000\nÂ£80,000\nÂ£90,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£125,000\nÂ£150,000\nÂ£175,000\nÂ£200,000\nÂ£225,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£275,000\nÂ£300,000\nÂ£325,000\nÂ£350,000\nÂ£375,000\nÂ£400,000\nÂ£425,000\nÂ£450,000\nÂ£475,000\nÂ£500,000\nÂ£550,000\nÂ£600,000\nÂ£650,000\nÂ£700,000\nÂ£800,000\nÂ£900,000\nÂ£1,000,000\nÂ£1,500,000\nÂ£2,000,000\nÂ£3,000,000\nPrice to\nÂ£200\nÂ£300\nÂ£400\nÂ£500\nÂ£600\nÂ£700\nÂ£800\nÂ£900\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£1,250\nÂ£1,500\nÂ£1,750\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£2,250\nÂ£2,500\nÂ£2,750\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£3,500\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£4,500\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£10,000 +\nSearch\nWeather for Buckingham\nWednesday 10 April 2013\n5 day forecast\nToday\nCloudy\nTemperature: 5 C to 10 C\nWind Speed: 13 mph\nWind direction: South\nTomorrow\nLight rain\nTemperature: 5 C to 12 C\nWind Speed: 14 mph\nWind direction: South west\nSpecial Features\nHow can I get a courtesy car if my car is stolen or written off?\nHome\nHome\nContact us\nRegister\nTopics A-Z\nServices & Offers\nJobs\nMotors\nProperty\nLocal Business\nFamily Announcements\nSpecial Offers\nCompetitions\nBuy a Photo\nShop\nDating\nSave on your energy bills\nBingo\nReader Travel\nAdvertise With Us\nSpecial Features\nContact us\nHelp\nAccessibility\nTerms and Conditions\nDisclaimer\nCookies Policy\nSwitch to Mobile Site\nAll rights reserved Â© Johnston Publishing Ltd.\nThis website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissionâs Code of Practice.

It is self-governing, but linked politically to the US.\nThe economy relies on tourist arrivals, mostly from Japan, and clothing exports. It is vulnerable to downturns in both.\nThe CNMI is exempt from US minimum wage and immigration laws; this has helped to drive a billion-dollar garment trade which employs thousands of migrant workers, many of them from China and the Philippines. Migrants outnumber the indigenous Chamarro and Carolinian populations.\nThe Battle of Saipan was fought on the islands during World War II\nThe industry was dealt a blow in 2005 when, under liberalised world trade rules, the US scrapped import quotas on Chinese-made garments.\nEconomic woes were compounded when, months later, Japan Airlines ended flights to the territory, hitting the tourist trade.\nSpain proclaimed sovereignty in the 16th century. The diseases brought by the early European settlers decimated the indigenous population. The islands came under German, and then Japanese, control in the 20th century.\nThe islands saw some of the heaviest fighting in the Pacific during World War II. Japan lost control of the main island, Saipan, after US forces invaded in June 1944. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians perished in the bitterly-fought campaign.\nThe battle for Saipan was a turning point in the Pacific war, allowing the island of Tinian to become a staging post for the 1945 US atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nAfter the war, the Northern Marianas were governed by Washington as a UN-mandated Pacific trust territory. The islands sought political union with the US in the mid-1970s. CNMI residents are US citizens. The territory receives millions of dollars in aid from Washington.\nIn November 2008 Gregorio Sablan was elected as the Marianas first nonvoting delegate to the US House of Representatives. The islands are the last US territory to receive representation in Congress.\nThe CNMI is home to several active volcanos; Anatahan, north of Saipan, has been erupting on and off since 2003.\nMore on This Story\nCountry profiles: Asia\nAfghanistan\nAustralia\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nBrunei\nCambodia\nChina\nCook Islands\nEast Timor\nFiji\nFrench Polynesia\nGuam\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia\nJapan\nKashmir\nKazakhstan\nKiribati\nNorth Korea\nSouth Korea\nKyrgyzstan\nLaos\nMacau\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nMarshall Islands\nMicronesia\nMongolia\nMyanmar\nNauru\nNew Caledonia\nNepal\nNew Zealand\nNiue\nNorthern Marianas\nPakistan\nPalau\nPapua New Guinea\nPhilippines\nSamoa\nSingapore\nSri Lanka\nSolomon Islands\nTaiwan\nTajikistan\nThailand\nTibet\nTokelau\nTonga\nTurkmenistan\nTuvalu\nUzbekistan\nVietnam\nXinjiang\nRelated Internet links\nGovernor's office\nNorthern Marianas parliament\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites\nShare this page\nDelicious\nDigg\nFacebook\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nMore Asia-Pacific stories\nRSS\nAustralia shock at asylum tragedy\nAustralians are shocked after a boat filled with asylum seekers capsizes on its way from Indonesia, and at least eight people die.\nXenon detected at Fukushima plant\nChina schools closed after blast\nTop Stories\nPupils face national rankings at 11\nUK arms exports 'raise questions'\nSuit water leak halts ISS spacewalk\nSame-sex marriage set to enter law\nHeathrow to unveil third runway plan\nFeatures\nAfter the bump\nAre real women's bodies still beautiful after pregnancy?\nCounting crowds\nWere Egypt's protests really the biggest in history?\nRhubarb rhubarb\nDo TV and film actors now mumble too much?\nRap almanac Watch\nProject charts language evolution of hip hop\nMost Popular\nShared\n1: Are post-pregnancy bodies beautiful?\n2: How do you count crowds?\n3: Same-sex marriage set to enter law\n4: 7 billion people and you: What's your number?\n5: Singer in French terror arrest\nRead\n1: RAC: Driving licences should change\n2: Heathrow to unveil third runway plan\n3: Glee star died from drink and drugs\n4: Video gamers given 'athlete' status\n5: Two men found dead in quarry lake\n6: UK arms exports 'raise questions'\n7: Pupils face national rankings at 11\n8: Wilkins 'had two glasses of wine'\n9: Driving test translator cheat jailed\n10: Are post-pregnancy bodies beautiful?\nVideo/Audio\n1: BBC News Channel Watch\n2: Fairground painter's stunning handiwork Watch\n3: Angry crowds boo Spanish Queen Watch\n4: The houses designed to last just 10 years Watch\n5: Mandela granddaughter: 'It's been hard' Watch\n6: Leak springs in astronaut's helmet Watch\n7: Blast bombs thrown at police in NI Watch\n8: Ð symbol for The on new keyboards?

He has become well known for his exploration of colonialism and post-colonialism within the contemporary context of globalization. Shonibare's work explores these issues, alongside those of race and class, through the media of painting, sculpture, photography and, more recently, film and performance. Using this wide range of media, Shonibare examines in particular the construction of identity and tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories.\nObject Number: UAC 709\nDisplaying Object 3 of 12\n<Previous12345..1112Next>\nUniversity Site Map\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nDisclaimer\ne-bulletin\n© 2010 University of the Arts London All Rights Reserved."],

Our tours always have that special touch of romance and adventure for which we are justifiably famous.\nMany of our clients return time and again to re-live the unique travel experience offered by AWT. Our tours are much more than holidays – they are specially crafted adventures, designed to give you unforgettable memories.\nBefore each tour we provide you with valuable practical information about each country you visit – the itineraries, currency issues, dress codes, and other related subjects.\nOne of the best aspects of an AWT holiday is the passengers. Seeing fabulous sites in the company of other, like-minded, people in a friendly and unhurried atmosphere does create a genuine sense of shared adventure and discovery.\nPeople of all types and ages come on our tours – singles, couples, families, the retired, students and those who are  simply in search  of something different – all find the AWT experience a refreshing and exciting change from ‘normal’ trips abroad.\nSTAY IN TOUCH WITH US:  CLICK HERE  to register for our newsletter to be kept informed of our latest special offers, trips, Open Days and events. Or CLICK HERE to view our contact details.\nDesert and Oases Travel with AWT\nDesert travel doesn’t have to be hard work, and with AWT you are in safe hands. Our 4WD Landcruisers have comfortable forward facing seats (no benches!) and hand picked drivers.\nThe Oases of Egypt have a long and fascinating history and have much to offer the traveller looking for new experiences. We explore ancient cities, amazing archaeology that is still being discovered and recorded as well as some incredible landscapes.  Meeting the people and discovering the culture of the desert oases is pure delight.\nWe have GPS units on every trip as well as the necessary maps and charts and satellite telephones for the deep desert. In the desert, we provide tents, sleeping bags, plenty of water, hot drinks and meals.  While in the oases themselves we stay at the best possible hotels available.\nAll our desert tours visit remote archaeological sites – places that are impossible to see unless you have the right equipment and passes. It is, however, the desert itself that provides the awe-inspiring experience. There is nothing quite like sitting around a camp fire under a canopy of stars.\nDuring the day, you pass through incredible landscapes; beautiful dunes, desolate rocky wastelands and friendly oases. Whether the tour has just one night in the stunning ‘White Desert’ or eight nights in the mountains and Wadis of Gilf Kebir, we know that you will have a fantastic time.\n \nThe AWT Team and Our Experts\nMost AWT holidays are escorted by a first-class Tour Manager who is there to make sure everything goes according to schedule. All you have to do is relax and enjoy the experience.\nThe majority are also accompanied by an academic expert who will be with the group throughout the journey to answer questions and give talks on various subjects relating to the sites being visited.\nAn insight here, an archaeological viewpoint there – these make all the difference to a tour of the ancient world  and really enhance one’s appreciation of a past civilization.\nOur experts include; Prof Kent Weeks, Dr Aidan Dodson, Dr Bill Manley, Dr Jo Fletcher, Dr Stephen Buckley and Prof Barry Kemp, featured above talking on site at Amarna.\nNeedless to say, there will also be a fully qualified local guide on all tours whose role it is to explain each monument in detail to ensure that you get the most from your daily excursions.\nAncient World Conferences\nOur aim is to present a series of illustrated lectures from an exciting panel of experts, covering a range of fascinating subjects. We look at archaeology and history from new and intriguing angles. The long weekend is an ideal opportunity to relax, catch up with friends and socialise with our experts.\n \nThe AWT conferences at University College London have been a huge success over the last few years. We have been hosting conferences for over a decade now at several venues including Highclere Castle, Reading University, the Ashmolean Museum and now UCL. \n \nThe Roberts Lecture Theatre at UCL was the setting for our 2012 conference. Guest speakers (featured above along with AWT staff), included, Dr Philippa Walton, Dr Bill Manley, Dr Stephen Buckley, Dr Aidan Dodson and Dr Campbell Price. Our guest speaker from Egypt was Dr Mansour Boraik, Director General of Upper Egyptian Antiquities, who was accompanied by our senior expert guide, Medhat Saad.\n \nFor the latest news of our very successful recent 2013 conference, please follow this link.\n \nOff the Beaten Track!\nMany of the sites we visit are away from the usual tourist trail. All tours have been thoroughly researched and planned by our experts who  have discovered some truly inspiring locations to explore.\nOur contacts in the archaeological world give us access to many places often closed to the general public. Being accompanied by a local, working archaeologist, is not unusual!\nOf course, all the major sites are visited, but it is these special places, full of atmosphere, which make AWT tours so very different.\n \nVIEW OR DOWNLOAD OUR BROCHURE HERE\nORDER A PRINTED BROCHURE COPY HERE\nREGISTER FOR OUR E -NEWSLETTER HERE\nAncient World Tours: PO Box 12950 : London : W6 8GY     \nUK Tel: 0844 357 9494  INT Tel: +44 844 357 9494\nI WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO SOMEONE     UK 0844 357 9494     INT +44 844 357 9494\nAWT is an agent of Bales and VJV Worldwide Ltd.

Total cost £3400.\nCustomer C - Pays £4500 from a local conservatory company who fabricates the conservatory, builds the base and erects it all themselves.\nCustomer D - Pays £5400 from a local conservatory company who buys the conservatory direct from the manufacturer and carries out all the installation work.\nCustomer E - Pays £6900 from a well known National conservatory company.\nLet us help you get the best conservatory prices\nTestimonies\n\"Thankyou for a very good service... I had threecompanies contact me\".\nC Schmidt - Enquiry Ref 444782\nâ€œthanks for your help, great service!â€�\nMandy Dyson Enquiry Ref 342804\nWe confirm that we are in the process of purchasing from ....... who have been very helpful - 10 out of 10 Thank you for putting them in touch.\nD King - Enquiry Ref: 360313\nConservatory Tips\nTip - If you are trying to find a cheap diy conservatory in and around Birmingham B15 bear in mind that if you beat the price down many less professional suppliers will agree to get your order but will sell you short later. There is always a price point below which you will be buying rubbish.\nTip â€“ If you are looking for a cheap diy conservatory in and around Birmingham B15, like most industries some conservatory companies are better than others and itâ€™s not necessarily the size of the business that guarantees the best quality or value for money.\nTip - While you are searching for a cheap diy conservatory bear in mind that you should know what type of conservatory youâ€™re interested in, and have an idea of how much it should cost before you start to negotiate with a supplier. The salespeople are generally paid a commission, and their objective is to get you to pay as much as they can without losing the order, so always get prices from a few suppliers in and around Birmingham B15.\nTip â€“ If you are looking for a cheap diy conservatory in and around Birmingham B15, if your conservatory takes longer than agreed for delivery, or more than a reasonable time, you will generally be entitled to claim compensation.\nTip â€“ If you are looking for a cheap diy conservatory in and around Birmingham B15 it is worth noting that a bronze-tinted roof reduces the light coming into your conservatory and can make it dark - needing lights on all day â€“ exactly what you donâ€™t want in a room designed to make the most of the sun. Consider opal-tint instead.\nBestQuote Enquiry Service Ltd Copyright ©\nBUDGET CONSERVATORIES BIRMINGHAM B16 | A CONSERVATORY COMPANY WEST BROMWICH B70 | THE PRICE OF A PVCU CONSERVATORY WEST BROMWICH B71 | PRICES FOR PVCU CONSERVATORIES BIRMINGHAM B37 | CONSERVATORY QUOTATIONS COVENTRY CV8 | A CONSERVATORY SUPPLIER SUTTON COLDFIELD B76 | AN ESTIMATE FOR CONSERVATORIES WALSALL WS9 | BUDGET CONSERVATORIES SMETHWICK B67 | PVCU CONSERVATORY PRICES COVENTRY CV4 | A SUPPLIER OF CONSERVATORIES DUDLEY DY2 | CONSERVATORY QUOTATIONS HALESOWEN B62 | A CONSERVATORY SUPPLIER BIRMINGHAM B15"],

The idea behind our blog is to provide you with a valuable insight into how we as the general public go about making our decisions to buy gifts and greetings cards in our day to day life. The intriguing thought process of gift-giving is a subject that is often overlooked and some may not even be aware that it actually exists. However, this type of study has been investigated by many different psychologists for more than 40 years and there are many theories behind why we spend so much of our hard-earned cash on the treats that we buy for the people around us.\n \nIt is regularly thought that our reasons for buying cards and gifts are solely based on commercial influence, for example Christmas, Valentine's and Mother's Day or Father's Day. This may be true in many circumstances, although as already mentioned, there are so many thought processes which have fascinating influences on the decisions we make around giving and receiving.\n \nSo what will you learn by following our blog and reading these posts? Some of the things that we want to share are the secrets on giving romantically between couples. Other ideas we are looking to give you explanations on, are the intangible health benefits that are believed to be gained from giving to others as opposed to receiving. We also discuss the feelings of fulfilment when shopping for the perfect cards and gifts for the receiver you long to impress. Why does it make us feel so good?\n \nMany of the studies that have been carried out around the psychology of gift giving, lie within huge text books and are written in some complex styles. It is for these reasons that many people are unlikely to know about the very existence of the subject, which means it's our goal to provide you with details of the outcomes of studies in a simplistic form. To do so, we will be using various forms of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Google Plus, which will in turn, enable us to use visual images, snippets of info and most importantly, articles on the official Cardly Blog – 'It's The Thought That Counts'. And who knows? We may even throw in the odd joke or two to keep you on your toes.\n \nSo that's the intro for you, I hope you're looking forward to a journey of fascinating discoveries. If you have any comments or anything in particular you wish to hear about, then feel free to drop us a line and tell us your thoughts. We would really like to engage with our readers as much as possible, as it is they/you who make this blog beneficial.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on April 15, 2013 by adamsm.\n1 Item(s)\nShow\n10\n20\n30\nper page\nSearch\nRecent Posts\nBlog Launch - What's the big idea?\nArchives\nApril 2013\nCategories\nUncategorized\nHome\nAbout Us\nDelivery\nNews\nContact Us\nTestimonials\nSite Map\nFAQs\nLinks\nx\nMy Cart\nYou have no items in your shopping cart.\n \nloading...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQty:\nAdd to Basket\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "],

Media requires JavaScript to play.\nTesla is a maker of sporty battery operated vehicles\nContinue reading the main story\nGlobal Car Industry\nIn pictures: Frankfurt motor show\nElectric cars: The future of motorsport?\n'Green' investment pays dividends - Toyota\n'Worst over' for European car sales\nThe electric car maker, Tesla, has made the first profit in its 10-year history.\nThe company said it made $15m (Â£9.65m) in the first three months of the year, thanks to sales of its Model S electric sedan. Total revenues hit $562m, a huge rise on the $30m reported a year ago.\nTesla said it was receiving worldwide orders for the Model S in excess of 20,000 vehicles per year.\nShares in the company jumped more than 16% in after-hours trading.\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at 12 cents, three times what Wall Street analysts were expecting.\nShorting shares\nTesla shares have skidded across the markets in recent times.\nContinue reading the main story Analysis\nShanaz Musafer\nBusiness reporter, BBC News, New York\nAs other electric car makers face troubles, Tesla appears to be going from strength to strength.\nThe Model S marked Tesla's attempt to bring electric vehicles to a broader market - starting at $49,500, it costs around half the price of the Roadster. And the early signs are promising.\nSales of the Model S exceeded its own guidance in the quarter, which will be especially pleasing after a New York Times review of the car said it ran out of power sooner than expected in the cold, a review which chief executive Elon Musk branded as \"fake\".\nMr Musk has been making headlines of late, with talk of \"autopilot\" cars. Such innovation has led some to start asking if the company is \"the new Apple\" and if Mr Musk is the new Steve Jobs.\nSuch comparisons may be premature, but analysts will be keeping a keen eye on whether Tesla can keep up its momentum.\nTesla Motors in New York Times row\nOver the past few weeks, Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has made a number of comments about making electric cars more affordable, which has been pushing the shares higher.\nThey are up 67% so far this year, but many dealers remain unconvinced and have been shorting the stock - betting on the share price dropping - in anticipation of a fall.\nThe company has 72.6 million shares in its \"float\" - the number of shares circulating among the general public. Of those more then 42% are being borrowed by traders to sell short.\nMr Musk feels such votes of little or no confidence by the market are misplaced and foolhardy.\nOn his personal Twitter page, he tweeted last month that there \"seems to be some stormy weather over in Shortville these days\".\nRocky road\nNonetheless, the spark seems to have gone out of the electric car market in the US recently and it has been a troubling time for some of the green technology start-up companies involved in the sector.\nLast week, Coda Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after selling just 100 all-electric sedans. The cars had a range of around 88 miles (142km), the best in its class, but considerably lower than the Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S.\nFisker Automotive, the makers of a high performance electric hybrid called the Karma, has hired bankruptcy advisers and is seeking a buyer.\nMore on This Story\nGlobal Car Industry\nFrankfurt motor show\nIn pictures: Frankfurt motor show\nElectric cars: The future of motorsport?\n'Green' investment pays dividends - Toyota\n'Worst over' for European car sales\nJaguar to create 1,700 new jobs\nIn pictures: Jaguar C-X17\nIndustry news\nMitsubishi hit by share sale report\nHyundai union approves wage deal\nUS car sales at near six-year high\nUK blocks car key hack revelation\nVideo reports\nInside a PSA Peugeot Citroen assembly line Watch\nOne of the cars being unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show - which opens today - is the Peugeot 2008.\nWhich city has the worst traffic?

I remember vividly my âBountyâ years, when I couldnât get enough of those so-sweet chocolate and coconut bars, and my affection for this combination is still strong.\nMore\nIN Recipes\nRecipe â quince and pear almond crumble\nThe Paris baker â kaiserschmarren, or torn Austrian pancake\nRecipe â pheasant with celery, cream and pimentÃ³n\nRecipe â mackerel teriyaki, cucumber salad\nIn this version I have changed the milk chocolate to dark, which is even better. The idea came about as I was serving one of our most popular cakes, chocolate orange polenta, and it occurred to me to change the polenta for coconut. After several trials we settled on this recipe, which has finally quelled my nostalgic desire.\nThis cake is very dense and perfect for a dessert or tea time. It could be even better if you can find natural coconut essence (I havenât succeeded so far in France). A scoop of coconut ice cream would be lovely to serve and, as always, make sure the chocolate is the best you can buy. We use Valrhona Guanaja for all our chocolate cakes.\nRose Carrarini is co-owner of Rose Bakery in Paris and author of âHow to Boil an Eggâ (Phaidon, Â£22.95)\n-------------------------------------------\nChocolate coconut cake\nTake care when baking this cake as it might not seem cooked when the specified time is up. But as long as the knife comes out clean, it is â it dries and sets afterwards. You will need a buttered and lined loaf tin of about 26cm. Preheat oven to 180C.\nÂ©Roberto FrankenbergChocolate coconut cake\n100g desiccated coconut\n200g ground almonds\n90g rice flour\n90g (90ml) cream\n60g dark chocolate\n1/4 cup cocoa powder\n2-3tbsp hot water\n220g unsalted soft butter\n200g caster sugar\n3 large eggs\n1tsp vanilla essence\n1/4tsp salt\nâ In a baking dish toast the coconut until very lightly golden. Take out and cool before adding to the ground almonds and rice flour.\nâ Gently heat the cream until almost boiling and pour over the chocolate in a bowl. Let this stand until the chocolate has melted and stir into a smooth paste. In another small bowl put the cocoa powder and add the hot water and stir into a smooth paste too. Add this to the chocolate cream (ganache) and stir well. Put aside.\nâ Beat the butter and sugar together until light, then add the eggs one by one until well mixed. Add the vanilla (and a dash of coconut flavouring if you have it). Fold in the dry ingredients and salt. Mix well and put into the tin. Bake for about 55 mins.\nâ Take out and cool in the tin. You can pour some melted chocolate and cream on top or dust with icing sugar.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2013.

Peter Commins, is to leave the trust for a prestigious role at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p> <p>Mr Commins, 49, who has been at the Royal Free for four years, has been appointed to a new post, director of operations and finance, which extends to deputising for the chief executive. </p> <p>The MHRA is the government agency which is responsible for ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.</p> <p>Ã¢â¬ÅAround 80% of the income of the MHRA comes from fees to the pharmaceutical industry for regulatory work and licensing,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ said Mr Commins, who was acting chief executive for three months before Andrew&nbsp; WayÃ¢â¬â¢s arrival last year.

The MHRA this week dominated the headlines with its report criticising the disastrous Parexel drug trial which left six healthy men seriously ill. It urged caution in the use of the entire class of drug tested on the volunteers. </p> <p>Mr Commins, who lives in Pinner and is married with two teenage children, is a qualified accountant with an MA in financial management and an MBA. His scientific background, however, is less impressive. Ã¢â¬ÅI have a grade H in GCSE chemistry, so IÃ¢â¬â¢ve got a lot of catching up to do there.Ã¢â¬ï¿½</p> <p>He is very sorry to be leaving the Royal Free, but is ready for a new challenge in a very different environment. Ã¢â¬ÅI wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t want to work in any other part of the NHS than the Royal Free,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ he said. Ã¢â¬ÅThe best part of the past four years by far has been working with so many impressive, friendly and committed people delivering such vital services.Ã¢â¬ï¿½</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><br />&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"reviewed\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div id=\"footer\">\n\n<div id=\"nhs-direct\">\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Call 111 when it's less urgent than 999\">\n\n<img src=\"Imgs/imgs/logos/nhs_direct_111.jpg\" alt=\"Call 111 when it's less urgent than 999\" border=\"0\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div id=\"UCL-partners\">\n<a href=\"http://www.uclpartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UCL Partners\"><img src=\"Imgs/imgs/logos/UCL-partners.jpg\" alt=\"UCL Partners\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"twitterfeed\">\n\n<IFRAME height=60 src=\"http://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/twitter.aspx\" frameBorder=0 width=450 scrolling=no></IFRAME>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"rfc\">\n<a href=\"http://www.royalfreecharity.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Visit the Royal Free Charity websitel\"><img src=\"Imgs/imgs/logos/RoyalFreeCharityLogo.gif\" alt=\"Royal Free Charity\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"twitter\">\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/RoyalFreeNHS\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Royal Free Hospital on Facebook\"><img src=\"Imgs/imgs/logos/facebook_small.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" alt=\"The Royal Free Hospital on Facebook\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"youtube\">\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalFreeHospitalNHS\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Watch the Royal Free Hospital NHS's Youtube channel\"><img src=\"Imgs/imgs/logos/youtube_small.jpg\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" alt=\"Watch the Royal Free Hospital NHS's Youtube channel\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div> \n\n<div id=\"footercontent\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"accessibility.aspx\">Accessibility</a></li>\n<li>|</li>\n<li><a href=\"default.aspx?top_nav_id=3&sel_left_nav=42&tab_id=27\">Links</a></li>\n<li>|</li>\n<li>&copy; <a href=\"copyright.aspx\">Copyright and Terms & Conditions</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div> \n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nSys.Application.initialize();\n//]]>\n</script>\n</form>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-7554712-1']);\n_gaq.push(['_setDomainName', '.royalfree.nhs.uk']);\n_gaq.push(['_setLocalRemoteServerMode']);\n_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n(function() {\nvar ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\nga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

However, if they get involved with this yearâs sponsors then they may still pay through the nose in the long term.\nLoans Company, Wonga, will be a key sponsor for Transport for London over Christmas and New Year â despite charging 2689% APR. In many ways this seems like sheer opportunism at a time of year when so many Londoners will be struggling for cash.\nKen Livingstone was critical of the move, calling it a clear demonstration of Tory values:\nâItâs hard to think of a clearer demonstration of the values of todayâs Tory party than Boris Johnsonâs decision to sell prime time advertising space on Londonâs buses and tubes to a loan company known for charging 2689% APR.â\nâWhile millions enter Christmas and the New Year with concerns over their jobs and family finances, our Conservative Mayor is busy plastering the capital with adverts for loans companies who profit from increasing the debts of the poorest in society.â\nEven Johnson himself thinks that the company are charging âextortionateâ rates of interest. Speaking to LBC this afternoon, he said:\nâPeople should be aware of the extortionate rates of interest that they can charge and people should not enter into irrational or unwise debt obligations.â\nIs this another u-turn from Londonâs gaffe prone mayor? Does he really not know if this is a good idea or not? Or was he blinded by the lure of Wonga?\nRelated posts:\nWrong on the recession, wrong on the recovery: Darling turns up the heat on Osborne\nGeorge Osborne: wrong on the recession, wrong on recovery\nThe Government is wrong on Royal Mail\nTuition fees â time to admit we got it wrong\nWhy Purnell is right and Wheatcroft wrong\nComments are closed\nLatest\nNews\nMiliband says Labour would ban payday lenders from targeting kids\nThe next Labour government will ask the Advertising Standards Authority to prevent irresponsible advertising by pay day lenders that targets or exploits children and young people â thatâs the message from Ed Miliband, made in an exclusive comment piece in the Sun on Sunday.

The work was stopped immediately; and patients were transferred to Portland Ward after their evening meals - to ensure they remained safe.\n\"As soon as the Estates team started their work it was apparent it was going to cause some dust to fall through the roof space. The work stopped immediately and doctors sensibly suggested patients be transferred to Portland Ward; available as a decant at the present time, comments Dr Ian Medical Director. \"The work can now be completed and a full clean on Markham Ward can be done afterwards.\"\nThe transfer was completed in a couple of hours - with staff from all areas of the hospital helping out. \"We will always act to protect our vulnerable patients and ensure their safety,\" says Dr Barbara Stuttle, the Royal's Chief Nurses. \"The staff did a fantastic job and we were able to move patients with as little inconvenience as possible.\"\nThe repair works are expected to be completed this week - with Markham Ward operational 48 hours afterwards once an intensive clean and steam has been carried out.\nÂ \nENDS\nÂ \nÂ \nÂ \nContact\nFeedback\nGP login\nSitemap\nTranslate\nTranslate\nThis site can be automatically translated into various languages by Google Translate.

Every corner of Donegal is bedecked in green and gold as the county has been captured by Jim McGuinness and his team.\nTicket sales have reached levels never before seen in Donegal. Indeed, the biggest exodus from Donegal since the famous final of 1992 will head for Dublin on Sunday.\nThe county board moved 12,000 tickets by last week, but with sales in other outlets and sales to Donegal people in other counties, the Donegal support will be around 30,000 of Croke Parkâs 82,300 capacity. The Jonesâ Road stadium will be packed to its rafters for the big game.\nDonegal take on Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final at Croke Park this Sunday. See Friday's Donegal News for a special 24-page souvenir supplement looking ahead to the big match!\nAcross the county, peopleâs imaginations have been grabbed by Donegalâs march to the semi-finals.\nA painting depicting Jim McGuinness as Che Guevara dominates the Main Street in his native Glenties; Liz McFaddenâs house in Dunfanaghy proclaims âWho needs Cagney, weâve got Lacey!â; in Creeslough, Roseâs Bar has a painting of the four St Michaelâs players â Christy Toye, Colm McFadden, Martin McElhinney and Daniel McLaughlin â and McGuinness on the front of the building wishing them well; while the local radio and the internet has been hogged by the recently-released songs of The Tractor Boys (âThe Green and Gold Jersey of Tir Chonaillâ) and The Regulatos (âBack to the Hillsâ).\nIf you havenât already got a ticket, then join the scramble â GAA officials confirmed last weekend that the fixture was a sell-out. The well has run dry on tickets as an unprecedented Donegal demand has been called for a semi-final fixture â Donegalâs first since 2003.\nâItâs unreal, we wouldnât have expected this at all. It is the biggest that I have ever dealt with,â said county administration manager Noreen Doherty.\nMrs. Doherty paid tribute to county secretary Aodh MairtÃ­n Ã Fearraigh for his assistance and also to her niece, Lynne McGowan, for aiding in the distribution of tickets from the office in Ballybofey, which has been a hive of activity over the last fortnight.\nShe said: âAodh MairtÃ­n has been a fantastic help. We were in four nights last week, where we distributed 12,000 tickets. He is a voluntary officer and the help he has been to me has been superb. My nice Lynn has been a great help since the Ulster final too. This is a job that I couldnât have controlled on my own.\nâHopefully it will pay dividends on Sunday. Iâd like to compliment all the clubs too, they have been doing outstanding work distributing the tickets â everyone in the county is playing their part.â\nÂ \nSimilar Articles:\nTicket frenzy for Tyrone clash\nDonegal fever: 'Cowboys' warned\nIt's a sell-out as Donegal chase Ulster glory\nAll-Ireland mania reaches zenith\nThousands âdisillusioned and disappointedâ atâ¦\nÂ \nÂ Â \nÂ \nTweets by @Donegal_News\nOnline Editions:\nFriday:\nMonday:\nView the entire newspaper online using your desktop computer, tablet or smart phone.\nÂ \nThe Donegal News| St. Anne's Court | Letterkenny | County Donegal | Ireland\nt: 00353 74912 1014\ne: contact@donegalnews.com\nÂ© Copyright 2013 â Donegal News.

The sides are layered with cream and fenced with chocolate shards.\nEquipment and preparation: To make the chocolate decorations, you will need a small balloon, a balm-infused tissue and a plastic scraper (you can make one from a plastic tub lid), two sheets of acetate, a confectioner's thermometer and a cold marble slab.\nIngredients\nFor the cake\n500g/1lb 2oz dark chocolate, (around 60% cocoa solids), chopped\n500g/1lb 2oz unsalted butter, softened\n100g/3Â½oz golden caster sugar\n10 medium free-range eggs\n250g/9oz self-raising flour\n150g/5Â½oz ground almonds\n1 tsp vanilla extract\nFor the chocolate glaze\n150g/5Â½oz dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids), chopped\n150g/5Â½oz double cream\n50g/1Â¾oz unsalted butter\nFor the syrup\n80g/3oz caster sugar\n50g/1Â¾oz glucose syrup\n60g/2Â¼oz black raspberry liqueur, such as Chambord\nFor the filling\n250g/9oz raspberry conserve\n600ml/20fl oz double cream, whipped until firm peaks form when the whisk is removed\n500g/1lb 2oz fresh raspberries\nFor the chocolate decorations\n600g/1lb 5oz dark chocolate (around 40% cocoa solids), chopped finely\n600g/1lb 5oz white chocolate (around 40% cocoa solids), chopped finely\nPreparation method\nPreheat the oven to 150C/170C (fan)/Gas 3. Grease and line the bottom and sides of 2 x 23cm/9in cake tins, with butter and baking parchment. Ensure the lining paper on the sides comes to 3cm/1Â½in above the rim of the tin.\nFor the cake, place the chopped chocolate into a large heatproof bowl. Melt the chocolate by suspending the bowl over a pan of simmering water (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water). When melted, remove from the heat and add the butter. Stir until the butter is melted and completely incorporated. Set aside to cool slightly.\nTechnique: Melting chocolate\nMeanwhile whisk the sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl until foamy and well combined.\nSift the self-raising flour over the eggs and fold to combine, then fold in the ground almonds.\nTechnique: Folding\nWhen the chocolate mixture is slightly cooled, fold into the cake batter until well combined.\nDivide the mixture equally between the prepared cake tins. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until springy to the touch.\nCool the cakes in the tins for five minutes, before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.\nFor the chocolate glaze, chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a heatproof bowl.\nHeat the cream in a small saucepan until just before the boiling point.\nPour the cream over the chocolate and stir until completely melted. Add the butter and stir until completely melted and incorporated.\nFor the syrup, place 100ml/3Â½fl oz of water, the caster sugar and glucose syrup into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and allow cool slightly. Before the syrup is completely cold, add the liqueur.\nFor the filling, warm the raspberry conserve in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. When it becomes runny, pass it through a sieve into a heatproof bowl. Set aside.\nFor the chocolate decorations, ensure all your equipment is out and prepared before you start. Inflate a small balloon to a 15cm/6in diameter and rub it all over with a balm-infused tissue. This will act as a mould to create a chocolate bowl, so adjust the size as you like. Have a completely flat baking tray to hand (you can use your worktop if it is completely flat and not wooden) for spreading the chocolate to make curls.\nPlace 150g/5Â½oz of the chopped dark chocolate into a heatproof bowl and set this above a pan of gently simmering water (ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water). Melt, stirring occasionally, until the temperature is 46-48C/115-118F. You can check this using a confectionary thermometer.\nRemove from the heat and add another 150g/5Â½oz chopped dark chocolate, stirring occasionally until melted.\nDip the round end of the balloon into the melted, tempered chocolate to create a bowl shape. Set aside to cool on a piece of baking parchment, with the bottom of the chocolate bowl down, until set. Gently deflate the balloon to remove, teasing the rubber from the inside as necessary.\nSpread some more tempered chocolate on the flat work surface or upturned flat baking tray. Allow to cool until the chocolate no longer leaves a mark on your finger when gently pressed.\nUsing a plastic scraper, push through the chocolate, scraping up a tight curl. Repeat until the chocolate is used up, then set aside to set completely.\nTo make the chocolate chards, cut some acetate sheets to the height of the cake plus a bit. Cut it with a wavy edge. Chill one large or two small heavy-based baking trays.\nPlace a quarter of the remaining chopped dark chocolate into a heatproof bowl and set this above a pan of gently simmering water (ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water). Melt, stirring occasionally, until the temperature is 46-48C/115-118F.\nRemove from the heat and add another 150g/5Â½oz chopped dark chocolate, stirring occasionally until melted.\nPlace the acetate sheet onto a cold marble slab. Pour the dark chocolate onto the acetate sheet and spread it with a palate knife so that the chocolate overlaps the edges. When doing so, make sure to introduce some weak lines across the chocolate so that it will break where required â do this with a knife to get a natural cutting point.\nTransfer the acetate to the chilled heavy, baking trays and allow to cool completely. Refrigerate it if the workspace is too warm.\nWhen cooled, break along the lines.\nMelt the white chocolate separately in the same way and make white chocolate shards in the same way.\nTo assemble the cake, drizzle both cakes with a little of the syrup. Place one cake layer onto the serving board. Spread with raspberry preserve, then a layer of whipped cream and half of the fresh raspberries. Top with the second cake layer.\nPour the glaze over the cake. Smooth the sides of the cake with a palate knife and allow to set.\nWhip the remaining cream until stiff and spread around the sides of the cake. Stick the shards to the whipped cream to form an alternating white and dark chocolate vertical stripe pattern. The shards should overlap slightly so that the cream doesn't show when assembly is complete.\nPlace the chocolate bowl on top of the cake and fill it with fresh raspberries and with a few chocolate curls sticking out.\nRequired techniques\nMelting chocolate\nFolding\nBy\nRobert\nFrom\nThe Great British Bake Off\nVegetarian\nOvernight preparation time\n30 mins to 1 hour cooking time\nServes 10-12\nBinder is now Your Favourites\nFind out what has changed\nRead our blog post explaining why\nShare this page\nPrint version\nShopping list\nSend to a mobile\n1 person has recommended this recipe\nSign in to recommend\nSpecial Diets\nPregnancy-friendly recipes\nShellfish-free recipes\nVegetarian recipes\nQuick recipe finder\nType the ingredients you want to use, then click Go.

Media requires JavaScript to play.\nHousehold dual fuel bills are estimated to be on average 5% - or Â£64 - lower now than they would be without these policies, it said.\nNearly half of the average household dual fuel energy bill, or about 47%, is made up of fossil fuel prices, or Â£598, with the second largest cost attributed to network costs or transport and distribution of energy, at 20%, or Â£257.\nGovernment policies on energy and climate change account for 9%, or Â£112 of this bill - with Â£30 of this spent on renewable energy policies, including Â£9 on on-shore and Â£9 on off-shore wind.\nContinue reading the main story âStart Quote\nWe are doing all we can to offset these global energy price risesâ\nEnd Quote\nEd Davey\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary\nMore than half of the energy and climate change policy costs in household bills are spent on measures to target the fuel poor and energy efficiency.\nThe report showed that 85% of the rise in household bills between 2010 and 2012 was from wholesale energy costs and network costs and 15% as a result of government policies.\nHousehold energy consumption has been on a downward trend since 2005, partly as a result of energy efficiency measures already in place, according to the report.\nBy 2020 around 12 million boilers will have been replaced with more energy efficient models, it said.\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: \"Global gas price hikes are squeezing households. They are beyond any government's control and, by all serious predictions, are likely to continue rising.\n\"We are doing all we can to offset these global energy price rises, and while we have more to do, this new study shows our policies are putting a cushion between global prices and the bills we all pay.\"\nCaroline Flint, shadow energy and climate change secretary, said: \"The government's underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families' energy bills is shameful... Instead of cooking the books to trick people into thinking their energy bills will be lower, ministers should get behind Labour's plans to overhaul the energy market and deliver fair prices for the public.\"\n'Less positive'\nThe report also found that businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy costs that are on average 21% higher as a result of energy and climate change policies, with this figure rising to 22% by 2020.\nLarge energy-intensive users currently face energy costs that are on average between one and 14% higher as a result of policies, with this rising to between six and 36% by 2020.\nThe estimates did not include measures the government was currently considering to reduce the impact of low carbon policies on the costs of electricity for energy intensive industries, including a Â£250m package of compensation for industry to 2014/2015.\nMr Davey said: \"The picture for business is less positive, which is why our new proposals to exempt and compensate the most energy intensive industries from certain policy impacts is crucial. Nothing would be gained from forcing industry, jobs and emissions abroad.\"\nSteve Radley, policy director at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"Measures to shield the most energy-intensive industries from a portion of the costs will make a difference but, unless we get a grip on spiralling policy costs, steeply rising electricity prices for the rest of the sector risk making the UK an increasingly unattractive location for industrial investment and undermining efforts to rebalance the economy.\n\"The first step is scrapping costly policies with questionable environmental impact, such as the carbon price floor and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, as soon as public finances allow.\"\nMore on This Story\nRelated Stories\nGreen Deal loans scheme launched\n28 JANUARY 2013,\nBUSINESS\nFuel bills: New heat on ministers\n25 JANUARY 2013,\nPOLITICS\nBattling bills - what help is there?\n12 OCTOBER 2012,\nBUSINESS\nQ&A: Plans to simplify energy tariffs\n20 NOVEMBER 2012,\nBUSINESS\nFuel help urged for poor families\n04 JANUARY 2012,\nEDUCATION & FAMILY\n'One in four' face fuel poverty\n02 DECEMBER 2011,\nBUSINESS\nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy subsidies\n31 OCTOBER 2011,\nBUSINESS\nCan you cut your gas bill by 15%?\n18 AUGUST 2011,\nMAGAZINE\nHow warm is your home?\n03 MARCH 2011,\nMAGAZINE\nRelated Internet links\nEnergy and Climate Change Committee\nDept of Energy and Climate Change\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites\nShare this page\nDelicious\nDigg\nFacebook\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nMore Business stories\nRSS\nRefund problems for debit cards\nSome customers claiming refunds on their debit cards have been disappointed because of time limit problems\nBoeing Dreamliner returns to service\nChurchill to feature on new banknote\nTop Stories\nPR guru Clifford vows to clear name\nArmed drones operating from Britain\n'9/11 jet debris' found in New York\nNew MMR jab clinic in measles fight\nWelby raps City 'entitlement' ethos\nFeatures\nDad's locked up\nHow Tom Conti's father was detained for being Italian\nIllusions dispelled\nWhy four Britons fled from a grim jihadist training camp\nTroubled land\nWas beautiful Dagestan the launch pad for the Boston bombs?\nTuck in\nHow to eat healthily on Â£1 a day\nMost Popular\nShared\n1: Nuts withdrawn over warning failure\n2: How little money can a person live on?\n3: Churchill to feature on new banknote\n4: In pictures: Dark Pripyat\n5: Clifford charged with sex assaults\nRead\n1: NYPD finds '9/11 landing gear'\n2: Britons fled grim jihadist camp\n3: Clifford charged with sex assaults\n4: Refund problems for debit cards\n5: Armed drones operating from Britain\n6: Royals' gifts to Obamas reported\n7: How to eat healthily on Â£1 a day\n8: North Korea to indict US citizen\n9: Whisky Galore ship bottles auctioned\n10: Arrest made after huge web attack\nVideo/Audio\n1: BBC News Channel Watch\n2: Suburban house is N Korean embassy Watch\n3: M62 Crash: W Yorks community in shock Watch\n4: Dreamliner new batteries fitted Watch\n5: Pavement explosion in central London Watch\n6: M62 crash: Aerial view of site Watch\n7: Kew reorders plant collection Watch\n8: China dog mounts graveside vigil Watch\n9: Woman on hen party dies in M62 crash Watch\n10: Fast-car crooks foiled by own videos Watch\nServices\nÂ Mobile\nÂ Connected TV\nÂ News feeds\nÂ Alerts\nÂ E-mail news\nAbout BBC News\nEditors' blog\nBBC College of Journalism\nNews sources\nEditorial Guidelines\nBBC links\nMobile site\nTerms of Use\nAbout the BBC\nPrivacy\nBBC Help\nCookies\nAccessibility Help\nParental Guidance\nContact Us\nBBC Â© 2013 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Investment in clean energy has already been falling due to recession - by 15% last year.\nThe EU retains a renewable energy target of 20% of all electricity generation by 2020 - but incentives for renewable energy elsewhere are less clear.\nWhilst the talks are stalled \"capital will be deployed, but it will be deployed to the high-carbon economy\", says Abyd Karmali, President of the International Carbon Markets association.\nIn other words, business as usual.\nSome doubted if a treaty at Copenhagen could ever have provided the money needed.\nAnalysts Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimate that $500bn has to be spent on clean energy every year to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2020.\nMany clean technologies need a very high carbon price to be economic.\n\"These technologies really won't see a breakthrough carbon price until 2025 or later - but the investments need to happen today,\" says Tom Kerr from the International Energy Agency.\nNational policies\nCatherine Bremner, Head of international development at the Carbon Trust claims the encouraging news is outside the talks.\nChina and India have both launched policies to encourage clean energy investment and the US allocated one hundred billion in its recent stimulus bill towards clean technologies.\nWithin the EU, even meeting existing targets will still require major investment.\nSeparate to its emissions target the EU has an overall renewable energy target of 20.\n\"We need to be putting two wind turbines down a day for the next 10 years,\" in the UK alone, to meet EU targets, says Ms Bremner.\nNational and regional schemes often offer direct subsidies of the kind that is hard to agree on at international level.\n\"People can take stuff that is real at a national or regional level to the bank.\" Says Michael Liebreich, CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\nHis organisation say 700 pieces of new legislation have been passed around the world promoting clean energy - partly thanks to the Copenhagen process.\nThe US is set to pass its key legislation in the next year.\nWith the destination of the UN process now unknown a lot depends on it.\nBookmark with:\nDelicious\nDigg\nreddit\nFacebook\nStumbleUpon\nWhat are these?\nE-mail this to a friend\nPrintable version\nCOPENHAGEN SUMMIT 2009\nKEY STORIES\nCopenhagen depresses carbon price\nUN says Copenhagen deal 'a start'\nCorrespondents' log\nReaction in quotes\nWorld media reacts to climate deal\nFEATURES AND ANALYSIS\nWhy did it fail?\nRichard Black gives eight reasons why there was no global deal\nWhat did COP15 achieve?\nCopenhagen fails green investors\nWhere's the beef?\nBACKGROUND\nDeal at a glance\nQ&A: The Copenhagen summit\nAtmospheric change over 800,000 years\nClimate change glossary\nVIDEO AND AUDIO\nBan Ki-moon: 'Essential beginning'\nTuvalu rejects Copenhagen pact\nClimate deal 'neither strong nor fair'\nMiliband: Some wanted summit to fail\nObama's closing statement in full\nAROUND THE BBC\nRichard Black's Earth Watch\nTOP BUSINESS STORIES\nUnemployment dips to 2.47 million\nCredit Suisse offices are raided\nEU gives backing to BA alliance\nMOST POPULAR STORIES NOW\nSHARED\nREAD\nWATCHED/LISTENED\nElephants 'understand human gesture'\nPapal medal misspells name of Jesus\nLiving Ohio man ruled 'legally dead'\nImagine a world without shops or factories\nEuropean origins laid bare by DNA\nMost popular now, in detail\nSHARED\nREAD\nWATCHED/LISTENED\nUS footballer's baby dies in beating\nThe strange life of John McAfee\nThe little-told story of the massive WWII pet cull\nBlock on cold calls 'not working'\nMany dead as migrant boat capsizes\nAmazon removes abuse themed e-books\n10 things we didn't know last week\nCourt orders girls' MMR vaccination\nWarning after water firm's collapse\nMan died after eating caffeine mints\nMost popular now, in detail\nSHARED\nREAD\nWATCHED/LISTENED\nBBC News Channel\nMartin McGuinness slept in Queen's bed\nKarachi residents' bombproof cars\nSyrian rebels 'executed families'\n1940: Dunkirk rescue completed\nOne Pound Fish Man's pop quest\nIllegal immigration into Europe\nCourt summonses rise after council tax benefit cuts\nElephants respond to human gestures\nHiggs 'told of Nobel win on street'\nMost popular now, in detail\nFEATURES, VIEWS, ANALYSIS\nGhost town\nHas China's housing bubble burst?\nThe guerilla plant\nHow the world's oldest clove tree defied an empire\nWalking away\nWhy Royal Ballet principal Sergei Polunin quit\nMost Popular NowMost Popular Now | 20,786 people are reading stories on the site right now.\";\nSkip to top\nPRODUCTS & SERVICES\nE-mail news\nMobiles\nWidgets & Alerts\nNews feeds\nInteractive TV\nPodcasts\nBBC iD\nBBC iD\nSettings\nSign out\nSearch term:\nbbc.co.uk navigation\nNews\nSport\nWeather\niPlayer\nTV\nRadio\nMoreâ¦\nCBBC\nCBeebies\nComedy\nFood\nHistory\nLearning\nMusic\nScience\nNature\nLocal\nNorthern Ireland\nScotland\nWales\nFull A-Z of BBC sites\nBBC links\nMobile site\nTerms of Use\nAbout the BBC\nPrivacy\nAccessibility Help\nCookies\nContact the BBC\nParental Guidance\nBBC Â© 2013 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Donald E. Knuth –\nTeX. Output of Knuth’s TeX is a file in DVI format. The difference between TeX\nand pdfTeX is that pdfTeX directly generates PDF. You can also create PDF with\nAdobe’s Distiller program, using a DVI to PostScript program to create PS from\nTeX’s DVI file.\nWARNING: pdfTeX is alpha software!\n1.1.2 What is TeX?\nFrom ‘TeX – The Program’ by Donald E. Knuth: “This is TeX, a document com-\npiler intended to produce typesetting of high quality”. TeX is a batch oriented\ntypesetting system. When we talk about TeX we mean the macro programming\nlanguage as well as the program that interprets and executed this language.\n1.1.3 What is PDF?\nThis question is answered in the Adobe Systems’ document Portable Document\nFormat Reference Manual available at http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/\n3\ndevrelations/PDFS/TN/PDFSPEC.PDF on page 27. It can not be repro-\nduced here for strange copyright reasons.\nThink of PDF as PostScript without programming constructs. A PDF file con-\nsists of graphical objects tight together in such a way that fast viewing is possible\nand incremental updates become possible.\n1.1.4 How can I view a PDF file?\nThere are several .pdf readers available as freeware over the internet.\nAdobe’s Acrobat Reader is available for many operating systems, including\nWindows 95, NT, and 3.1, Macintosh, Linux, Sun, and OS/2. Download the\nself-installing executabale from Adobe’s website: http://www.adobe.com/\nprodindex/acrobat/.\nGhostscipt is a .ps interpreter and Ghostview is its graphical front-end. Ghostscript\nis also available for many operating systems, including UNIX and VMS, MS-DOS,\nMS-Windows, OS/2 and Macintosh. See the Ghostscript homepage at http:\n//www.cs.wisc.edu/˜ghost/ for details, documentation, and downloads.\nAnother previewer is xpdf, a PDF viewer for X maintained by Derek B. Noon-\nburg (mailto:derekn@aimnet.com) with a home page at http://www.\naimnet.com/˜derekn/xpdf. Xpdf runs under the X Window System on\nUNIX, VMS, and OS/2 and is designed to be small and efficient. It does not use\nthe Motif or Xt libraries and only uses standard X fonts.\n[FIXME: some words about Xpdf and other PDF vievers]\n1.2 Authors\n1.2.1 Who is the author of pdfTeX?\nThe primary author of pdfTeX is Han The Thanh (mailto:thanh@fi.muni.\ncz). [FIXME: in pdftex.ch there is also Petr Sojka and the current head (rector) of\nMasaryk’s University - prof. Jirˇı´ Zlatusˇka.]\n2 Information\n2.1 Locations\n2.1.1 Where can I find pdfTeX?\n[FIXME: ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/{janik,thanh}\ndaily mirror on ftp://ftp.inet.cz/pub/Mirrors/pdfTeX\n4\n2.1.2 What is the latest version?\nThe latest version of pdfTeX is pdfTeX-0.12n. This is the latest version of pdfTeX\napproved by Han The Thanh (for now). After this version the primary author (Han\nThe Thanh) left Czech Republic and is away for about three or four months. When\nhe comes back, he will continue on the pdfTeX’s development. In the meantime\npdfTeX’s maintainer is Pavel Janı´k ml (he is also student of Masaryk’s University).\nHe releases bug-fixes to pdfTeX-0.12n as versions pdfTeX-0.12o-?, where ‘?’ is a\nsmall number. The latest bug-fix release is pdfTeX-0.12o-6.\n2.1.3 Where can I find some docs about pdfTeX?\nA website for the pdfTeX project is maintained by Sebastian Rahtz (mailto:\ns.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk), and can be found at:\nhttp://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/\nIn it you will find:\n• The pdfTeX manual in PDF format:\nhttp://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdftexman.pdf\nand HTML format:\nhttp://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdftexman.html\n• The pdfTeX mailing list archives:\nhttp://tug.org/ListsArchives/pdftex/threads.html\n• This FAQ in PDF format:\nhttp://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdfTeX-FAQ.pdf\nand DVI format: http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/\npdfTeX-FAQ.dvi\n[FIXME: The best documentation is in the source files...]\n2.1.4 Is there a pdfTeX mailing list?\nYes, to subscribe send mail to mailto:majordomo@tug.org, and put the\nline:\nsubscribe pdftex username@hostname\nin the body of the message, where username@hostname is your complete email\naddress.\n5\n2.1.5 Where can I find an archive of the pdfTeX mailing list?\nAn ftp site of the mailing list, arranged chronologicaly can be found at: ftp:\n//ftp.tug.org/mail-archives/pdftex/ Daily mirror is also at ftp:\n//ftp.inet.cz/pub/Mirrors/pdfTeX-MailArchive/\n2.1.6 How do I get new versions of this FAQ?\nThe TeX version of this document is periodically posted to pdfTeX’s mailing list.\nIt is also uploaded to http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/\npdfTeX-FAQ.pdfwith its LaTeX source: http://www.tug.org/applications/\npdftex/pdfTeX-FAQ.tex\n2.1.7 How do I contribute to this FAQ?\nSend email to the FAQ maintainer: Jody Klymak mailto:jklymak@apl.\nwashington.eduwith the word FAQ in the subject line. If possible FAQ en-\ntries should be formatted like this example:\n\\question{This_is_a_template_faq_question}{This is a tem-\nplate faq question}{1998/09/24}\n{\n\\contributor{Pavel Jan\\’{\\i}k jr}\n{mailto:Pavel.Janik@inet.cz}{1998/09/10}\n\\contributor{Jody Klymak}\n{mailto:jklymak@apl.washington.edu}{1998/09/24}\nThis is a sample FAQ question.

You can manually specify compression from 0 to 9 in the\nsource file by the tag \\pdfcompresslevel:\n\\pdfcompresslevel9\nor in the configuration file (pdftex.cfg):\ncompress_level 9\n0 means no compression and 9 is the most (and the slowest) compression.\n3.1.5 What can I do with this pdftex.cfg file?\n3.1.6 How can I make a document portable to both latex and pdflatex\nCheck for the existence of the variable \\pdfoutput:\n\\newif\\ifpdf\n\\ifx\\pdfoutput\\undefined\n\\pdffalse % we are not running PDFLaTeX\n\\else\n\\pdfoutput=1 % we are running PDFLaTeX\n\\pdftrue\n\\fi\nThen use your new variable \\ifpdf\n7\n\\ifpdf\n\\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}\n\\pdfcompresslevel=9\n\\else\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\fi\n4 Fonts in pdfTeX\n4.1 Fonts in general\n4.1.1 What kind of fonts can I use?\n4.2 Type1 fonts\n4.2.1 How do I use Type1 fonts?\n4.2.2 How do I generate TFM files for Type1 fonts?\n4.3 TrueType fonts\n4.3.1 How do I use TrueType fonts?\n4.3.2 How do I generate TFM files for TrueType fonts?\n4.4 pk fonts\n4.4.1 How do I use pk fonts?\n4.4.2 Why does Acrobat Reader display pk fonts so poorly?\n5 Graphics\n5.1 Graphics in general\n5.1.1 How do I include pictures in pdfLaTeX?\nPictures come in two formats, vector or bitmapped. When possible, use vector for-\nmats when making a PDF document since they can support an arbitrary ammount\nof magnification. So far, pdfLaTeX supports graphics inclusions in PDF, JPEG,\nPNG, and MetaPost formats [FIXME: what others? Also which are vector or not?]\nAs with LaTeX, the best package for image inclusion is graphics/graphicx,\navailable on CTAN. In order to get the graphicx package working with pdflatex\nyou must get http://tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdftex.def\n8\nand put it in your TeX tree (mine is at C:\\TeX\\share\\texmf\\tex\\latex\\\ngraphics). Then some slight modifications to your source file:\n%% In the preamble add\n\\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}\n%% OPTIONAL: In the main document, immediately after \\begin{document}\n\\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.jpg,.pdf,.mps,.png}\n%% To include a graphics file\n\\includegraphics{filename_to_include}\nThe package will then search for the filename with the above extensions if one\nisn’t provided. With this package the image can also be scaled or cropped. This\nuses D. Carlisle’s “graphics” package and is available on CTAN at /macros/\nlatex/packages/graphics. Note that by not including file-extensions in\nthe \\includegraphics command, you can maintain PDF and DVI versions of\nyour document, especially if you include postscript figures (see question 5.2.2 and\nquestion 3.1.6)\n5.2 Vector Formats\n5.2.1 How do I include PDF pictures?\nIn order to include PDF pictures you need pdfLaTeX 0.12n or later. Make sure that\nthe PDF figure is properly cropped. See Question 5.2.3 for how to do this for EPS\nfiles. [FIXME: How do you get Distiller to do this?] Then follow the steps outlined\nin Question 5.1.1.\n5.2.2 How do I include EPS pictures?\nYou cannot directly do so. You must convert encapsulated postscript pictures to\nPDF first, explained in question 5.2.3, and then include them (see question 5.2.1)\n5.2.3 How do I convert an EPS figure to PDF?\nYou can use epstopdf (a Perl script which uses Ghostscript for conversion) at\nhttp://tug.org/applications/pdftex/epstopdf or Distiller to do\nthe work for you. [FIXME: add an example here]\nTo use epstopdf, you need Perl 5. Usage of epstopdf is easy:\nepstopdf.pl myfile.eps\n9\nconverts your eps-graphic file myfile.eps to the file myfile.pdf.\nValid options for epstopdf (v2.1) are: [FIXME]\nChange the line\n$GS=\"gs\";\nin this script to the name of your Ghostscript executable if it is different, e.g.\n$GS=\"gswin32c\";\non a Win32 system.\nOn some systems it is necessary to invoke Perl explicitly, e.g. with\nperl epstopdf.pl myfile.eps\n[FIXME: How do you use distiller??]\n5.2.4 Why doesn’t my pdf picture show up when I include it?\nYou are using Distiler to convert your .eps file to pdf. Distiller does not always set\nthe bounding box correctly. The bounding box of an enbedable pdf document must\nbe the page size, and if any part of your figure extends beyond the bounding box,\nthe figure will not show up. There are two solutions.\n1. Get texutil.pl from http://www.ntg.nl/context/zipped/texutil.\nzip and say\ntexutil --fig --epspage file.eps\nand the file is corrected for distiller. (This solution is from Hans Hagen\nmailto:pragma@wxs.nl.)\n2. Instead of running distiller, use http://www.tug.org/applications/\npdftex/epstopdf (see question 5.2.3)\nAnother tool that might be of some help is aimaker. Aimaker ia a perl script that\nis designed to convert generic .eps files into .aieps files that can be read by adobe\nilustrator. Aimaker calculates the bounding box for the eps file. Aimaker is avail-\nable at ftp://ftp.aos.princeton.edu/pub/olszewsk/aimaker.shar\n10\n5.3 Bitmap Formats\n5.3.1 How do I include TIFF pictures?\n5.4 Other Graphics\n5.4.1 How can I use MetaPost in pdfTeX?\n6 Miscellaneous\n6.1 Kpathsea\n6.1.1 What is this kpathsea?\n6.2 Hyperref\n6.2.1 What is hyperref?\nThe hyperref package is a way of adding hyper-references to a LaTeX document.\nFor instance, a reference to a figure in the text can be marked up with a hyper-\nlink, allowing the user to jump to the figure without scrolling through a lot of\ntext. [FIXME: but for now see the hyperref package documentation hyperref.dvi\nor manual.pdf]\nThe hyperref package is available on CTAN (or a CTAN mirror) at ftp://\nftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/\nhyperref\n6.2.2 How can I use it?\n[FIXME: but for now see the hyperref package documentation hyperref.dvi or man-\nual.pdf]\n6.2.3 My pdftex.cfg says to use A4 paper, but the document comes out in\nLetter format.\nYou certainly use hyperref. This package sets the page dimensions according\nto your settings in LaTeX. If you do not specify “a4paper” in your options to\n\\documentclass, it assumes Letter paper and overrides the entries in your\npdftex.cfg file.\n11\n6.2.4 I get the message: “Warning (ext1): destination with the same identi-\nfier already exists!”\nYou get this message if you use hyperref and have some page numbers more than\nonce, e.g. when re-starting page numbering with each chapter or having an ap-\npendix.\nCircumvent this with\n\\usepackage[pdftex,plainpages=false]{hyperref}\nor put\nplainpages=false\ninto your hyperref.cfg.\n6.3 ConTeXt\n6.3.1 What is ConTeXt?\nConTeXt is a full featured macro package that has build in support for pdfTeX.\nMore information can be found at http://www.ntg.nl/context (manuals,\nsource code, examples).\n6.3.2 How can I use ConTeXt?\nA Contributors\n• Carl Zmola zmola@acm.org\nQ5.2.4–10\n• Carl Zmola zmola@campbellsci.com\nQ5.2.1–9\n• Christian Kumpf mailto:kumpf@igd.fhg.de\nQ3.1.6–7\n• Colin Marquardt mailto:colin.marquardt@gmx.de\nQ5.2.3–9 Q6.2.3–11 Q6.2.4–12\n• Jody Klymak jklymak@apl.washington.edu\nQ2.1.3–5 Q2.1.4–5 Q2.1.5–6 Q2.1.6–6 Q5.1.1–8 Q5.2.2–9\n12\n• Jody Klymak mailto:jklymak@apl.washington.edu\nQ2.1.7–6\n• Michael Sanders mailto:sanders@umich.edu\nQ1.1.4–4\n• Pavel Janı´k jr mailto:Pavel.Janik@inet.cz\nQ1.1.1–3 Q1.1.2–3 Q1.1.3–3 Q1.2.1–4 Q2.1.1–4 Q2.1.2–5 Q3.1.1–7\nQ3.1.4–7 Q6.2.1–11 Q6.3.1–12\n• Steve Phipps mailto:slpp@ix.netcom.com\nQ1.1.4–4\n13\nGeneral\nTeX and PDF\nWhat is pdfTeX?\nWhat is TeX?\nWhat is PDF?\nHow can I view a PDF file?\nAuthors\nWho is the author of pdfTeX?\nInformation\nLocations\nWhere can I find pdfTeX?\nWhat is the latest version?\nWhere can I find some docs about pdfTeX?\nIs there a pdfTeX mailing list?\nWhere can I find an archive of the pdfTeX mailing list?\nHow do I get new versions of this FAQ?\nHow do I contribute to this FAQ?\nInstallation\nGeneral Installation\nHow do I install the latest version of pdfTeX?\nHow do I use pdflatex (how to generate pdflatex.fmt)?\nWhy use pdflatex vs (??? i.e. latex2html)?\nHow do I compress my PDF files?\nWhat can I do with this pdftex.cfg file?\nHow can I make a document portable to both latex and pdflatex\nFonts in pdfTeX\nFonts in general\nWhat kind of fonts can I use?\nType1 fonts\nHow do I use Type1 fonts?\nHow do I generate TFM files for Type1 fonts?\nTrueType fonts\nHow do I use TrueType fonts?\nHow do I generate TFM files for TrueType fonts?\npk fonts\nHow do I use pk fonts?\nWhy does Acrobat Reader display pk fonts so poorly?\nGraphics\nGraphics in general\nHow do I include pictures in pdfLaTeX?\nVector Formats\nHow do I include PDF pictures?\nHow do I include EPS pictures?\nHow do I convert an EPS figure to PDF?\nWhy doesn't my pdf picture show up when I include it?\nBitmap Formats\nHow do I include TIFF pictures?\nOther Graphics\nHow can I use MetaPost in pdfTeX?\nMiscellaneous\nKpathsea\nWhat is this kpathsea?\nHyperref\nWhat is hyperref?\nHow can I use it?\nMy pdftex.cfg says to use A4 paper, but the document comes out in Letter format.\nI get the message: ``Warning (ext1): destination with the same identifier already exists!''\nConTeXt\nWhat is ConTeXt?\nHow can I use ConTeXt?\nContributors"],

He is called White-god. He is large and holy. Nine maidens, all sisters, bore him. He is also called Hallinskídi and Gullintanni (Gilded-teeth); his teeth were made of gold. His horse is called Gulltopp (Gold-top). He lives at Himinbjörg near Bilröst. He is the guardian of the gods and sits there at the end of heaven to guard the bridge from mountain giants. He needs less sleep than a bird. Night and day he sees a hundred leagues away; he also hears it when grass grows on the earth or wool on sheep or anything else that can be heard. He has a trumpet called the Gjallarhorn, whose blast can be heard in all the worlds.\nContinue readingClose\nIn Skáldskaparmál Snorri adds more tantalizing information when he tells how kennings can be made for Heimdall:\nBy calling him the son of nine mothers or guardian of the gods, as was written above, or White-god, enemy of Loki, seeker of Freyja’s necklace. A sword is called the head of Heimdall; it is said that he was struck against a man’s head. That is treated in the poem Heimdalargaldr, and thereafter the head is called fate of Heimdall; the sword is called fate of man. Heimdall is the owner of Gulltopp. He is also the visitor to Vágasker (Wave-skerry) and Singastein, when he fought with Loki for the Brísinga men. He is also called Vindhlér (Wind-shelter). Úlf Uggason versified for a long time in Húsdrápa about this story, and it is said that they were in the form of seals. He is also the son of Odin.\nWe have one fragment from the poem Heimdalargaldr, quoted by Snorri in Gylfaginning right after the passage just translated. In it the god himself speaks, saying that he is the son of nine mothers and the son of nine sisters. This must have been a poem in which Heimdall told of his life and exploits, and it would have been nice to have more of it preserved, for we understand only very imperfectly why a head should be called Heimdall’s sword. Was the blow with the head fatal? Did Heimdall have nine lives, one for each mother? If he died from the head blow, how can he still be around in the mythological present? Several sources say that he will sound the Gjallarhorn at the onset of Ragnarök, and Snorri adds in Gylfaginning that Heimdall and Loki will square off in the final battle and that they will kill each other.\nThis figure with its imposing horn, from a stone cross on the Isle of Man, recalls Heimdall and the Gjallarhorn.\n(Werner Forman/Art Resource)\nSnorri’s statement to the effect that Úlf Uggason versified extensively about the previous battle between Heimdall and Loki points out another sad loss, for only one stanza has survived. Thus the myth of a possible loss or theft of the Brísinga men and its recovery by Heimdall is forever lost to us.\nWe do have some potential information on Heimdall’s mothers, but it is conflicting. In Skáldskaparmál Snorri speaks of the nine daughters of Ægir and Rán. These fulfill the condition of being sisters, and since many of them bear names meaning or associated with the waves of the sea, Heimdall could somehow be the daughter of nine waves. Alternatively, he may be the one referred to in stanzas 35-38 of Hyndluljód, in the “Short Völuspá.”\n35. A certain one was born in days of yore,\nWith greatly increased power, of the race of gods;\nNine bore him, a man full of grace [?],\nGiant maidens on the edge of the earth.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n37. Gjálp bore him, Greip bore him,\nEistla bore him and Eyrgjafa,\nÚlfrún bore him and Angeyja,\nImdr and Atla and Járnsaxa.\n38. That one was increased by the might of the earth,\nOf the wave-cold sea and the blood of a sacrificial boar.\nMany of these names are those of known giantesses. Thor killed Gjálp and Greip and got Magni on Járnsaxa. Given Odin’s propensity for dallying with giantesses, this lot would fit the notion of Odin as the father of Heimdall, even if it cannot be demonstrated that they are sisters. It would be nice if the birthplace “on the edge of the earth” and the “wave-cold sea” could be associated with Ægir’s daughters, but no one has yet figured out how to do so successfully. Perhaps there were two traditions about Heimdall’s mothers.\nThe son of nine mothers, Heimdall is also, according to the prose header to the eddic poem Rígsthula, the progenitor of the social classes of humans. This prose states that Heimdall was traveling and came to a settlement by a coast, where he called himself Ríg. The poem goes on to tell how Ríg is entertained at three households, where he spends time in his hosts’ beds. The results are slaves, farmers, and nobles. Possibly related to this is the request of the seeress in Völuspá for a hearing, in the first stanza of the poem.\nI ask for a hearing of all the holy races\nGreater and lesser, kinsmen of Heimdall.\nThe notion of Heimdall as guardian of the gods is not limited to Snorri. Grímnismál, stanza 13, which Snorri quoted in Gylfaginning in connection with his description of Heimdall cited above, uses the expression, and Loki’s somewhat strange insult, in Lokasenna, appears to refer to it:\nShut up, Heimdall! For you in days of yore\nAn ugly life was allotted:\nWith a dirty wet back you will ever be\nAnd wake, guardian of the gods.\nIf the “dirty wet back” has to do with being out in all weathers, then perhaps the name Vindhlér has to do with the same idea.\nHeimdall’s preternatural hearing may be the subject of an obscure verse in Völuspá, stanza 26.\nShe knows that Heimdall’s hearing is hidden\nUnder the holy tree, accustomed to brightness;\nShe sees a river washed with a muddy waterfall\nFrom the pledge of Valfödr [Odin]—would you know yet more?\nThe “pledge of Valfödr” is his eye, sacrificed for supernatural vision. Apparently Heimdall put some portion of his hearing, or perhaps an ear, in the well at the base of Yggdrasil in order to obtain his special powers of hearing. Although he displays few other similarities with Odin, Heimdall does occasionally dispense wisdom, as when, in Thrymskvida, he suggests that Thor should dress up as Freyja in order to get back his hammer. But this passage is troubling, for it says that Heimdall, “whitest of gods, / could see well into the future, / like other vanir.” There are no other indications of Heimdall’s membership in the vanir. Nor has his whiteness ever been explained.\nHeimdall seems to have a certain connection with peripheral locations: born (if we take him to be the subject of the stanzas in Hyndluljód, as I do) at “the edge of the earth,” encountering humans by a coast, stationed at the end of heaven to guard against giants. These places are all to some extent boundaries: between land and sea, between the world of the gods and that of the giants. Being born “in days of yore” also situates Heimdall at a temporal periphery. Heimdall’s other main action in the mythology involves not a spatial but a temporal boundary, namely, his sounding of the Gjallarhorn at the outset of Ragnarök. The main source is Völuspá, stanza 46:.\nMím’s sons sport, and the world tree trembles\nAt the old Gjallarhorn.\nLoudly blows Heimdall, the horn is aloft,\nOdin is speaking to Mím’s head.\nIn Gylfaginning Snorri paraphrased this verse and added the information that Heimdall blows the Gjallarhorn in order to awaken all the gods for a meeting to deal with the oncoming forces of chaos.\nOf all the gods, Heimdall has the closest connection with an animal, namely, the ram. According to Skáldskaparmál, a form of his name, Heimdali, is a word for ram, and Heimdali and Hallinskídi turn up in the thulur for ram.\nSee also Ægir’s Daughters; Gjallarhorn; Hyndluljód; Rígsthula\nReferences and further reading:\nMy opening definition of Heimdall, above, incorporates the title of an article by Jan de Vries, “Heimdallr, dieu énigmatique,” Études germaniques 10 (1955): 257-268, which tries to solve the enigma through etymology: Dall means something like “spontaneous energy” and was the god’s original name, Heim, “world,” having been added later. As far as I can see, this etymology has gained no adherents and gets us no closer to the solution than does the standard etymology, “World-gleam,” which contributed to all sorts of nature-mythological interpretations. Nor does Hugo Pipping’s reading of the name as “World-tree” in his Eddastudier, vol. 2, Studier i nordisk filologi, 17:3, and Skrifter utgivna av Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland, 189 (Helsinki: Mercator, 1926), 120-130. Two Lund dissertations scrutinized Heimdall. The first was that of Åke Ohlmarks, Heimdalls Horn und Odins Auge: Studien zur nordischen und vergleichenden Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1: Heimdall und das Horn (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1937), which uses suspect methodology to reach suspect conclusions. The second, just four years later, was that of Birger Pering, Heimdall: Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zum Verständnis der altnordischen Götterwelt (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1941), who argued that “guardian of the gods” originally meant something more like a household spirit or brownie. Georges Dumézil, “Comparative Remarks on the Scandinavian God Heimdallr,” in his Gods of the Ancient Northmen, ed. Einar Haugen, Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology, 3 (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1973), 126-140, argues by means of a Celtic parallel for Ægir’s daughters as Heimdall’s mother. Kurt Schier, “Húsdrápa 2: Heimdall, Loki und die Meerniere,” in Festgabe für Otto Höfler zum 75. Geburtstag, ed. Helmut Birkhan, Philologica Germanica, 3 (Vienna: W. Braumuller, 1967), 577-588, makes sense out of the stanza in Úlf’s poem about the struggle between Heimdall and Loki. M. Meyer, “Beiträge zur germanischen Mythologie,” Arkiv för nordisk filologi 23 (1907): 245-256 (esp. 250-256), addressed the idea of Heimdall as a boundary figure. Rudolf Much, “Der nordische Widdergott,” in Deutsche Islandforschung 1930, vol. 1: Kultur, ed. Walther Heinrich Vogt, Veröffentlichungen der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Universitätsgesellschaft, 1928:1 (Breslau: F. Hirt, 1930), 63-67, made the most powerful case yet for Heimdall as ram. The most recent article devoted wholly to Heimdall is now rather long in the tooth: Franz Rolf Schröder, “Heimdall,” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur (Tübingen) 89 (1967): 1-41. It provides Indo-European and Mediterranean context but leaves us no closer to a satisfactory understanding of this enigmatic figure.\nThumbs down \nThumbs up \nDid you find this article helpful?\nWe're sorry this article wasn't helpful.

It was one more twist in the spiraling descent of the Argentina star, who had just started serving a 15-month ban from Italian football.\nAlthough he was already suffering from a cocaine addiction when he joined Napoli in 1984, he reached his greatest potential while at the club, winning two Serie A titles (1987, 1990) and the UEFA Cup (1989). Meanwhile, he shined on the international stage for Argentina, guiding them to the 1986 World Cup trophy while winning the Golden Ball at the tournament's best player.\nBut in March 1991, the Italian Football Federation suspended Maradona for 15 months after he tested positive for cocaine. He returned to Buenos Aires, but could not escape his troubles. On the morning on 26 April, police roused him from bed at his apartment and arrested him for possession of cocaine.\nMaradona's ongoing problems proved too much for Napoli, who transferred him to Sevilla in 1992 at the completion of his suspension. His troubles continued, however, including a dismissal from the 1994 World Cup after a positive test for ephedrine and another arrest for cocaine possession in 1997. The latter effectively ended his playing career.\nHe returned to the sport in 2008 to manage Argentina's 2010 World Cup campaign, but his contract expired after the tournament and he is currently out of football.\nPosted by\nBrian Seal\nat\n12:01 AM\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\nLabels:\nArgentina,\nDiego Maradona,\nS.S.C.

Scarring, moderate wrinkles, stretchmarks, age spots and mild pigmentation can all be successfully treated.\nThe Pure Roller uses 200 very fine needles designed to achieve a 'controlled injury' to the skin without damage leading to increased production of fresh collagen and elastin. The needles create temporary micro channels into the skin allowing greater absorption of products and ingredients.\nRegular treatments results in firmer, smoother and more youthful skin.\nPure Roller is also known as dermal roller and collagen stimulation therapy.\nHow does it work?\nThe principle behind Pure Rolling is stimulating and accelerating cell renewal plus new collagen, without damaging the epidermis.\nThe very fine titanium needles cause a controlled injury to the skin.\nAs the skin repairs itself, new collagen is deposited in the papillary dermis resulting in the Retes ridges plumping from underneath, smoothing out wrinkles, fine lines and indented scars.\nThe skins strength, collagen and elastin are improved resulting in a rejuvenated, smooth and youthful complexion.\nKey Facts\nRefresh - kick starts skins repair mechanism to reveal softer brighter complexion\nRefine - great for open pores, refines texture, smooths out indented scars, lines and wrinkles\nRebuild - collagen and elastin deposited in the dermis results in pluming and improves your skin colour and tone\nRevitalise - microchannels improve pathways for improved product absorption\nTreatment\nFollowing your skin health consultation (cost £20) your skin will be assessed for suitability using this treatment method. A program of 3 or 6 treatments will be planned leaving 2-4 weeks between each phase of the treatment program.\nOur treatments are performed by an experienced skin therapist fully qualified in the Dermapure Pure Roller System.\nTreatment time is under 1 hour, the great advantage of this treatment is the minimal downtime.\nAfter Care\nFollowing your Pure Roller treatment your skin will feel warm with a mild redness and a slight discomfort similar to mild or moderate sunburn. It is important to treat your skin gently and follow your therapists skin care advice.\nSkin Health Advisor Consultation £20.00\nPer treatment £180.00\nA course of 3 treatments £300.00\nA course of 6 treatments £430.00\nThe above prices include a pre/post roller skin care kit for optimum results.\nDermapure 'Pure Roller'\nIMPROVES THE APPEARANCE OF CELLULITE\nFADE SCARS AND STRETCH MARKS\nHELP HEAL SUN DAMAGE\nREDUCE FINE LINES AND WRINKLES\n< Prev\n \nNext >\n \n© Copyright 2007 - 2013 Options Beauty Salon All Rights Reserved.\nHead Office 40 Edenbridge High St, Kent, TN8 5AJ\nJoomla Templates by Joomlashack"],

On the weight of these collective commitments we aim to reduce the UK's emissions by 10% and bring about a visible change in the way that people think about climate change in the run-up to the crucial Copenhagen negotiations this December. While individuals and organisations may feel helpless in the face of climate change, 10:10 offers an ambitious, meaningful and engaging way for us to join up and tackle it together.\nWe would like to get as many Transition Towns signed up as possible before our launch date on 1st September, which you are also invited to attend at Tate Modern.\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you.\nRegards,\nDai Peters\n--\nDai Peters\noffice: 0207 388 6688\nmobile: 07896 161 438\nemail: david@1010uk.org\nwebsite: http://www.ageofstupid.net\n_________________\nAdvertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket - George Orwell\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Thu, 03 Sep 2009, 15:24 \nI think this could tie in so well with 999 - launching a group who set themselves the target of reducing their emissions by 10% by 10th October 2010. Presents a great opportunity to show people how to reduce emissions without lecturing, but instead inviting people to follow our progress (which we could record and share month by month), sharing tips, outlining cost savings, encouraging people to join in as they see the benefits . Anyone interested?\nTop   \n \nMark Eaton\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Thu, 03 Sep 2009, 15:36 \nJoined: Fri, 31 Jul 2009, 15:33\nPosts: 665\nLocation: Holbrook, Horsham\nI received this yesterday from a Simon Wakefield...\nQuote:\nEveryone's looking for something to do about climate change. What’s needed is something straightforward, immediate and meaningful. I think I've found it.\nToday I joined thousands of individuals and organisations from across the country to unite behind one simple idea: that by working together we can achieve a 10% cut in carbon emissions during 2010. It’s called 10:10, and everyone can be a part of it.\nCutting 10% in one year is a bold target, but for most of us it’s an achievable one, and is in line with what scientists say we need right now. By signing up to 10:10 we’re not just promising to reduce our own emissions – we’re becoming part of a national drive to hit this ambitious goal country-wide. In our homes, in our workplaces, our schools and our hospitals, our galleries and football clubs and universities, we’ll be backing each other up as we take the first steps on the road to becoming a low-carbon society.\nTo find out more and sign up go to http://www.1010uk.org\nTo read coverage of the campaign from the Guardian go to http://www.guardian.co.uk/10-10\n_________________\nAdvertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket - George Orwell\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Thu, 03 Sep 2009, 16:09 \nWell shall we invite people to sign up to join a 10.10.10 group on 999 evening? I could add it to the next press release. Pete Longley can give guidance on using Eco Eye to measure emissions and Alan could contribute on ecological footprinting. As Simon says it's a bold target but achievable and would provide a focus. It would be great on 9.9.9 to look ahead a year (+ a bit) and say this is what we're personally aiming to achieve. (Didn't hear about it from Simon - but read something in the paper about 10:10 today and suddenly clicked into place)\nTop   \n \nBeryl Wakefield\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Thu, 03 Sep 2009, 18:19 \nTH member\nJoined: Tue, 04 Aug 2009, 21:38\nPosts: 35\nSimon sent us an e-mail about this and I have just joined up as a \"person\" before reading the posts on the forum - but it's a great idea to do it for 999, count me in - again!\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Thu, 03 Sep 2009, 19:42 \nThat's good to hear Beryl. We'll have to get our heads together about it but I think there's lots of possibilities - talk soon!\nAdded later:\nI've signed Greenshift up as an organisation which has given me access to the official fonts and images so can prepare some material for 999 and then we (TH) can decide together what we'd like to do.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Mon, 07 Sep 2009, 20:42 \nHi Beryl,\nI've got a large white board and three differently coloured post it notes and thought we could invite people to stick up a) their pledges for the first steps they're going to take to reduce their emissions, b) ideas for what we could do as a community to help reduce further, and c) the benefits they think a lower carbon life will bring. The 10th October this year is a Saturday, so it could be an opportunity for a 'Green Tea' to officially launch the 10:10 group? Are you free that morning?\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Tue, 08 Sep 2009, 20:19 \nThis is the poster to accompany white board, Beryl, the colours correspond to the notes.\nAttachment:\n1010stickers.pdf\nThey're unusual fonts - hopefully they've embedded ok but if it looks strange let me know. I've got an A4 perspex display stand so we can place beside board. Hopefully people will get the hang of it but if not we're both close by to give assistance.\nYou do not have the required permissions to view the files attached to this post.\nTop   \n \nJohn Medway\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Tue, 08 Sep 2009, 22:23 \nModerator\nJoined: Mon, 03 Aug 2009, 18:01\nPosts: 69\nI actually went to the big sign-up at Tate Modern, and have a pendant made from a bit of a recycled Boeing 747 to prove it.

Nice to see your coppicing photos too! How's your walnut doing?

Saturday 10th is also the day that we will be at the Library most of the afternoon putting up the display ready for showing the following week.\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Fri, 11 Sep 2009, 09:10 \nHi Beryl,\nOh dear, that's awkward timing. The idea for this one would be to serve teas, coffee and cakes and biscuits and have display up about what we're going to do in 10:10 group and some energy saving items. Pete Longley has said he's happy to come along to demo Eco-eye so may have a designated meeting part for that so that he doesn't have to stay longer than he wants to. I've provisonally booked FMH from 10-12. My family can help with refreshments side so it would mostly be about being there to talk to people - you could just drop in for an hour if time's short. The purpose would be to interest more people in signing up to the challenge and will give us the opportunity for a press release. I thought we could make a giant 10:10 logo and have pictures taken with it. I'll email the people who signed up today and hopefully we can all meet up fairly soon to talk things through.\nTop   \n \nBeryl Wakefield\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Fri, 11 Sep 2009, 17:36 \nTH member\nJoined: Tue, 04 Aug 2009, 21:38\nPosts: 35\nShame about the timing but I'll come along in the morning and give a hand for as long as possible. Can talk it through together soon.\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Fri, 11 Sep 2009, 20:12 \nYes, really sorry about timing but I think it's important to try to fit in with the 10:10 date. I'll organise so that I don't need too much help but would be great if you can spare some time to briefly meet the other people. But your library display should come first as it's very important! I'm sending a vague introductory email shortly but then we can work together on all the details. Helen, the Quaker warden has been very supportive and we've been invited to their open morning on 4th October (coffee/cake/chat) to promote it - I'll definitely go along as might be able to interest some more people to sign up to the challenge.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Sat, 12 Sep 2009, 08:14 \nLee, our photographer, has come up with the idea of having a close-up of someone with 10's painted on their hands as an image to promote. I think it's well worth experimenting with. Also like the idea of perhaps having everyone who's signed up with 10's painted on their hands to accompany press release for open morning on 10th.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Mon, 14 Sep 2009, 10:02 \nChris Goodall has produced this handy table to show the effect of different lifestyle changes:\nhttp://www.carboncommentary.com/wp-cont ... -10-10.pdf\nAnd the Energy Saving Trust's Carbon Cutter seems one of the most simple ways of measuring current footprint and also gives you an individual action plan of suggested improvements:\nhttp://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/calculator/start\nBut we should look at other alternatives too.\nI think it may be simplest if I administer and publicise through Greenshift so that I can develop some resources and as the non-TH people now outnumber the TH and seem reluctant to use the Forum we need a means of communicating - perhaps a google group?\nAnyway we must start talking about all this - I'm not meaning to rush ahead without you but want to get something coherent in place for the 10th and time is liable to fly by!\nTop   \n \nBeryl Wakefield\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Mon, 14 Sep 2009, 18:00 \nTH member\nJoined: Tue, 04 Aug 2009, 21:38\nPosts: 35\nA google group is a good idea - I found the forum very daunting when I first looked at it, have got more used to it now just to post messages but there's probably a lot that I haven't sussed out yet. For anybody not used to computer \"language\" (like me!) it was all a bit offputting, perhaps that's why not many people are using it.\nAs far as 10:10 goes Chris Goodall's table is great and clearly shows what savings can be made.\nWhen are you free so we can get together and thrash out some ideas?\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Mon, 14 Sep 2009, 18:13 \nHenry's finally back at school and I'm between work projects this week so I can probably fit in with you. Keeping Wednesday free to help Clare K with Festival Drinks and seeing Helen from Quakers/Greening Thur morn. Otherwise any time tomorrow, early Thur afternoon or any time Friday. It will be great to get some ideas going together!\nWould be also good to get some feedback about which aspects of the forum are particularly daunting so we can think how to improve - Mark had planned his demo, but we could also offer some one-to-one 'master classes' if that would help.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Wed, 23 Sep 2009, 10:22 \nI've made a pdf of the first national 10:10 mailingAttachment:\n1010Mailing1.pdf\n- it's mostly detailing who's signed up so far and what they need the most urgent help with.\nJust to summarise where we are. I've booked Friends Meeting House on 10th October between 10am -12pm for a drop-in morning to encourage more people to sign up for campaign and support group. We'll prepare hand-outs on 10:10 and best ways of measuring and reducing emissions, will also have a stall of energy saving products and books and serve refreshments. Pete Longley has offered to come along for an Eco-eye demo. Hopefully everyone who's signed up so far will get involved in an eye-catching photo to promote the launch. I'm setting up a google-group for the support group to record their progress and swap tips and experiences. As Beryl and I are currently the only resources I think we have to be realistic about what we can do and so the main aim will be supporting individuals to meet their targets and promoting the national campaign. The main campaign also includes businesses, schools and organisations and there's clearly scope to work on that locally but need more people involved first.\nYou do not have the required permissions to view the files attached to this post.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Tue, 29 Sep 2009, 09:13 \nI sent the leaflet I've prepared to 10:10 for their approval and got a speedy response giving permission. They've said they'll send me a local group sign up pack which will give me ability to sign up people on computer which doesn't have internet access as well as paper sign-up forms and a 'whole bunch of other branding and publicity forms'. If anyone is interested in taking part in a photo to promote the Drop-in morning on 10th - please let me know. Will need to get press release to WSCT & Resident next Monday at latest so would need to be before the end of the weekend. I'm getting some leaflets and flyers printed - should receive them on Thursday. Here's a pdf of flyer if anyone wants to print off and pass around.\nAttachment:\n10-10flyer.pdf\nI've ordered an interesting range of items for the stall - descriptions on webpage: http://www.greenshift.biz/10-10.html. Plenty of the bulbs but only a few of the other items so if anyone wants to reserve something - let me know, prices will be below RRP.\nYou do not have the required permissions to view the files attached to this post.\nTop   \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Mon, 05 Oct 2009, 09:37 \nThe Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford have created a free on-line home energy monitoring website at http://www.imeasure.org.uk/ which they are using to help educate people about home energy use. imeasure is about helping householders track energy use over time (unlike traditional carbon\ncalculators) and users can set up carbon clubs for their own communities. Using the tool also provides valuable data for their research. The website includes a detailed comparison and analysis of existing carbon calculators. I'll add the link to the 10:10 page and try using the calculator myself.\nI went to the Horsham Quaker Open Day on Saturday and took along some 10:10 flyers and leaflets - lots of interest and I'm hopeful that some will come along on the 10th. Also gave me ideas for layout as they'd set it up beautifully with small tables to chat around and trestles for stalls - would be perfect setting for a 'world cafe' type event. Charlie suggested that a good image for the publicity would be a huge chocolate cake decorated with 10:10 to celebrate the launch - so have gone with that and will send press releases today.\nTop   \n \nMark Eaton\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Tue, 06 Oct 2009, 13:36 \nJoined: Fri, 31 Jul 2009, 15:33\nPosts: 665\nLocation: Holbrook, Horsham\nInvite Francis Maude, or whoever is your MP, to join 10:10: http://www.38degrees.org.uk/page/speakout/101038d\n_________________\nAdvertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket - George Orwell\nTop    \n \nClare Ewins\n Post subject: Re: 10:10 climate change campaign‏\nPosted: Tue, 06 Oct 2009, 15:12 \nGood suggestion, Mark, though I'm pretty sure he already has as he's the Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office and it was announced that all the government and opposition front benches had signed up. The Resident replied to let me know they'd definitely feature on their Events page and posters were accepted at Museum, Centre Cafe, Town and Country Weigh, Natural Way, Sainsburys, Fish & Chip shop and the Bishopric and M&C Newsagents. Still have plenty of beautifully printed flyers if anyone wants some. I applied to Totnes to see whether I can use the materials from their Transition Together pilot - but without the seed funding.\nTop   \n \nDisplay posts from previous: All posts\n1 day\n7 days\n2 weeks\n1 month\n3 months\n6 months\n1 year\n Sort by Author\nPost time\nSubject\nAscending\nDescending\n \n   Page 1 of 2\n [ 35 posts ]  Go to page 1, 2  Next\nBoard index » Activity Centre » Transition Horsham activities » Archive\nAll times are UTC + 1 hour [ DST ]\nWho is online\nUsers browsing this forum: No registered users and 1 guest\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum\nYou cannot reply to topics in this forum\nYou cannot edit your posts in this forum\nYou cannot delete your posts in this forum\nYou cannot post attachments in this forum\nSearch for:\nJump to: Select a forum\n------------------\nIntroduction and Forum Welfare\n   Hello, Let Me Introduce Myself...\n   Forum Help\n   Forum Suggestions, Plans and Developments\nActivity Centre\n   Sustainable Rudgwick activities\n   Transition Horsham activities\n      Archive\n   Events\nEnergy, Heat, Power & Light\n   Renewable Energy Consultancy\n   Solar Thermal\n   Suggest a new Energy, Heat, Power & Light forum!\nFood & Drink\n   Growing Your Own Food\n   Getting Wild Food\n   Swaps, Give-Aways, Sales and Wants\n   Buying Food\n   For the Table\n   Suggest a new Food & Drink forum!\nWater\n   Rainwater and Grey Water\n   Suggest a new Water forum!\nLand Management\n   Gardens and Allotments\n   Farms, Smallholdings and Market Gardens\n   Woodland\n   Suggest a new Land Management forum!\nReskilling - Trades & Crafts\n   Needlecraft\n   Suggest a Reskilling - Trades & Crafts forum!\nSustainable Living\n   Homes\n   Industry, Business, Employment and Work\n   Transportation\n   Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle, Replace and Adapt\n   Suggest a new Sustainable Living forum!\nThe Inner Us\n   Wellbeing\n   Suggest a new Inner Us forum!\nThe World Around Us\n   Information Resources\n   Horsham News\n   News - FYI\n   The Big Issues\nOn the Social Side\n   The Local\n   Let's Get Creative!\n \nPowered by phpBB © 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007 phpBB Group"],

Our FFS and body feminization philosophy is to individualize each surgical procedure to your unique needs and anatomy. As much time as necessary is devoted to your concerns by Dr Zukowski and his staff. Dr. Zukowski’s goal is to make you the most informed patient that you can be. We are not just satisfied to make you look better – but to look absolutely stunning in a natural and refreshed manner. You can choose to have your surgery performed in a hospital or fully accredited office-based surgicenter setting. Your safety, confidentiality and comfort are of the utmost concern. Dr. Zukowski even makes postoperative hotel and house calls. When is the last time your surgeon visited you postoperatively on Christmas, Easter, or almost every day that you were recovering if you are from out of town? When is the last time your surgeon gave you his personal cellphone number and told you to call him after hours with any concerns? ·Door-to-door limousine service, hotel recovery and in-house and hotel nurse sitters are available. Dr Zukowski has been a licensed Illinois physician and surgeon for over 27 years and has been working with the international gender community performing face and body feminization procedures for over·15 years. Dr. Zukowski is a Diplomate of The American Board of Plastic Surgery which means he is a true board certified plastic surgeon. Very few FFS doctors carry this distinction but still call themselves plastic surgeons.\nDr. Zukowski has been at the forefront of endoscopic plastic surgery minimal scar techniques for over·19 years and he has taught these procedures to surgeons throughout the world. While in the US Navy paying back a military scholarship debt, he met one of the three inventors of endoscopic plastic surgery techniques who mentored him in this field. Only a handful of surgeons in the world can make the claim of performing endoscopic plastic surgery techniques since May of 1993, and none besides Dr. Zukowski do FFS. We are the only FFS center in the world that performs both the soft tissue and aggressive three dimensional bone recontouring of the forehead frontal bone using endoscopic techniques. Endoscopic techniques are the standard of care in surgery today. Would you want your gallbladder removed thru a traditional 12 inch \"open\" incision or thru three half inch endoscopic incisions?  Would you want to have your knee surgery done thru a traditional 6 to 8 inch \"open\" incision or thru a series of ·endoscopic stab marks? ·Change is slow to plastic surgery and the people that say that endoscopic techniques do not work simply cannot do them. The thousands of patients that Dr. Zukowski has performed these techniques upon are testaments to the effectiveness of this procedure. These are not your grandfathers feminization techniques.\nThe latest in endoscopic technical innovations are meshed with gold standard techniques to give you a better, less invasive results that avoids traditional complications. Open, more invasive procedures can be performed by any board certified plastic surgeon, but these techniques carry built-in complications regardless of the surgeon that performs them. Longer scars, permanent hair loss, numbness and abnormal sensitivity to the scalp, and a lifetime of sinus headaches and runny noses are just a few of the proven forehead complications associated with \"open\" more invasive techniques. ·These occur regardless of who the surgeon is. If you like playing russian roulette as they relate to complications, then open forehead techniques are perfect for you. That is why the entire field of surgery worldwide has shifted to endoscopic techniques. If you do not believe me, then talk to my patients about their experiences with open techniques performed by other surgeons that I have revised.\nWe deliver outcomes that you can trust and 65% of our practice is gender related. With over 15 years of experience working with non-genetic female anatomy, we understand how to best give you the face and body that even your sister, mother, cousins and aunts will be envious of. We insure that your cosmetic surgery procedure is a pleasant, life altering experience that you will share with friends and family. And best of all – Dr. Zukowski stands behind his work 100%. There are no hidden surgical, general or local anesthesia, or facility fees if any touch-ups are required. We offer fair prices for the high quality of work we perform. This peace of mind is critical, especially in this economy. In a bad economy, many surgeons have increased their prices to ridiculous figures to make up for lost business. Surgeons who would have thrown you out of their practices a few years ago are suddenly doing FFS procedures. Even if you go to the top traditional plastic surgeons in the world, only 9% of plastic surgeons cosmetic patients are genetic males according to the 2011 American Society of Plastic Surgeons statistics. Face and body feminization is a big leap of faith in your surgeons skills so don't make the mistake many patients do in spending their hard earned money on unproven outcomes of the \"learning curve\".

The reel series is specifically developed for handling braided fishing lines which are often used for larger targets. This is due to their TwinDrag system – common in every Accurate fishing reel that ultimately made the company popular.\nThis reel series also features “AccuCast” which helps control casting by simply pushing a button. The button is placed on the side of the reel and the angler controls the line cast by pressuring the button until the desired casting strength is achieved.\nThe Accurate Boss Extreme Conventional reels have two versions: the TwinDrag version known for its smooth drag control and the 2-Speed TwinDrag version. The latter version features additional control for faster shifting from low to high gear. The 2-Speed version is ideal for anglers who are constantly facing rapidly changing environments and targets.\n  Product Name Price  \nAccurate Boss 2-Speed TwinDrag Saltwater Trolling Reels $629.99 to $649.99 www.basspro.com\nAccurate Fishing Boss Extreme Two-Speed Reels $569.99 to $599.99 www.basspro.com\nFishing-Rods-And-Reels.co.uk\nHome\nHelp/FAQ\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nFishing Rods\nFishing Reels\nFly Rods\nFly Reels\nFishing Poles\nFishing Combos\nBooks And Magazines\nSitemap\nFishing Articles\n©copyright fishing rods and reels 2010.

The United States hasn’t always been known for its great wines, but in the last 30-40 years a unique culture arose that is now reaching its greatest test for the young industry.\nWith the recession in full swing, American wine makers are being hit from just about every angle from foreign competition to shrinking profit margins.  Add to that a couple of lackluster harvest years in 2008, 2009, and now 2010; and American wine looks to be on the ropes.\nCalifornia’s real estate boom also quite literally “paved the way” for the current wave of land sales that are now occurring. As vineyards become less and less profitable, real estate developers are able to pick up huge tracks of land for relatively cheap and the owners can get out of their failing business.\nBut this has taken its toll on the whole culture; where vineyards used to be are now parking lots and commercial towers. As this progress develops, the whole fertile area might be paved over in a bid to put up ever cheaper housing options. It seems as if nothing can stop this boom; not even dropping the price and margin of their product down to discount wine levels.\nOregon, a relative newcomer to the world market, has also seen its own share of problems. With local sales dipping and the price of export increasing, profitability is dropping accross the board. More consumers are opting for discount wines delivered to their homes over buying a $25 bottle in a restaurant, which is affecting commercial demand.\nThe majority of sentiment for wine related businesses seems a “hold it through” attitude; that in a few short years the engines will be kicking again and it will have been worth the wait out. Some of course don’t have this attitude and are looking to sell their real estate shortly while they feel the prices will still be high.\nAmerican wines barely got their feet on the ground by the end of the 20th century, but it seems as if it may have been the great peak. After 2001 the next vintage that holds a name is 2005; and from that point on the story seems like a slow decline into oblivion. Let’s hope, for our own taste buds, that my bleak vision doesn’t come to be reality and that we can continue to get great American wine delivery.\nShare and Enjoy:\nPrint\nDigg\nSphinn\ndel.icio.us\nFacebook\nMixx\nGoogle Bookmarks\nBlogplay\nNo responses yet\nComments are closed at this time.\nTrackback URI |\nSearch\nCategories\nAlcoholic Drinks (4141)\nDrink Recipes (1)\nDrink Recipes Beer & Ale (104)\nDrink Recipes Cocktails (4155)\nDrink Recipes Coffee & Tea (181)\nDrink Recipes Frozen Drinks (27)\nDrink Recipes Liqueurs (27)\nDrink Recipes Misc (99)\nDrink Recipes Non Alcoholic (134)\nDrink Recipes Punches (172)\nDrink Recipes Shots & Shooters (682)\nInformation On Wine (10)\nTypes Of Red Wines (2)\nTypes Of White Wine (3)\nTypes Of Wines (3)\nUncategorized (44)\nWine (1666)\nWine Glasses (2)\nWine Making (6)\nWine Storage (6)\nFeed on\nPosts RSS\nComments RSS\nBlogroll\nWines\nHome Brewing\nMonthly\nApril 2013 (1)\nMarch 2013 (1)\nFebruary 2013 (2)\nDecember 2012 (3)\nNovember 2012 (3)\nOctober 2012 (5)\nSeptember 2012 (9)\nAugust 2012 (16)\nJuly 2012 (21)\nJune 2012 (57)\nMay 2012 (64)\nApril 2012 (68)\nMarch 2012 (90)\nFebruary 2012 (69)\nJanuary 2012 (146)\nDecember 2011 (89)\nNovember 2011 (67)\nOctober 2011 (54)\nSeptember 2011 (59)\nAugust 2011 (60)\nJuly 2011 (96)\nJune 2011 (89)\nMay 2011 (80)\nApril 2011 (44)\nMarch 2011 (77)\nFebruary 2011 (619)\nJanuary 2011 (321)\nDecember 2010 (165)\nNovember 2010 (168)\nOctober 2010 (288)\nSeptember 2010 (341)\nAugust 2010 (471)\nJuly 2010 (249)\nJune 2010 (556)\nMay 2010 (1641)\nApril 2010 (409)\nMarch 2010 (437)\nFebruary 2010 (4566)\nPages\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nSitemap\nVideos\nFree WordPress Theme courtesy of Wine Xpert & Coffee XpertTypes of Wines Copyright © 2013 All Rights Reserved."],

You will walk to the theatre reception with a relative/friend if you prefer.\nIf you have mobility problems, you will be escorted by a member of staff.\nYour property will be transferred to the designated ward whilst you are in theatre.\nIf your time in the Unit becomes a lengthy stay, staff will endeavour to transfer you before your operation to the designated ward pending the availability of a bed.\nThere are various consultants lists from all specialities running at any one time and you will not necessarily be seen in the order you arrival, with patients booked on morning lists taking priority.\nContact Details:\nContact:Jane Hosty, Sister\nTelephone:01279 444455 EXT 3186\nEmail:jane.hosty@pah.nhs.uk\nLocation:1st Floor (opposite Kingsmoor Ward) PAH, Hamstel Road, Harlow, Essex, CM20 1QX\nNHS Direct |\nDepartment of Health |\nNHS Choices |\nAccessibility |\nDisclaimer & Copyright |\nPrivacy & Cookies\nCredits |\nSite Map |\nChoose Text Size (A A A)"],

The new building will include 346 beds, with more than 50 per cent being in single rooms.\nFollowing 2010's General Election, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, reiterated the new Government's commitment to the redevelopment by including it in the October 2010 comprehensive spending review.\nThe plans form part of an initiative led by the local NHS, called Better Healthcare Closer to Home, which aims to improve the care provided to people from across Sutton and Merton. Better Healthcare Closer to Home is led by NHS South West London.\n[\nZoom\n]\nView of the new building from Wrythe Lane\nWhatÂ is included?\nOur plans include:\nÂ£127 million will be spent on a new state-of-the-art hospital building, which will house the majority of the hospital's wards and clinics;\nThe new building will have 346 beds, including 50 per cent in single rooms;\nÂ£40 million will be spent on upgrading the remainder of the hospital site, including operating theatres;\nÂ£17 million will be spent on opening a new local care centre, where people can receive diagnostic tests and x-rays. The centre will form part of the new building;\nOpening a purpose-built outpatients department, centralised eye clinic and dedicated pharmacy;\nBuilding a new multi-decked car park making it easier for patients, visitors and staff to park on the site. We will also make significant improvements to the hospital's entrances and exits.\nWhy are we doing it?\nSome of the key benefits are:\nFit for the 21st century - a hospital in which we can provide high quality care in a clean, safe and welcoming environment;\nImproved experience for patients - 50 per cent single bed rooms, single sex wards and improved disabled access;\nA better place to work for staff and volunteers - new facilities, including improved changing areas, better car parking and a new coffee shop;\nA more productive and efficient hospital - the new building will be designed in a way which meets today's style of healthcare, so that services fit together in the best way possible.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe cost of the work, in today's terms, is Â£190 million.\nThis figure works out at Â£219 million once inflation has been added (i.e. to calculate the cost when the work is due to be completed). These costs include Â£40 million upgrading the remainder of the St Helier site.\nThe cost of the redevelopment also includes integrating a local care centre within the new building, which will cost Â£17 million.\nCan we afford it?\nYes - we have spent a considerable amount of time working out what we can afford to do.\nIt is important to note that the cost of redeveloping St Helier is based on the income of St Helier only.\nHow will it be funded?\nThe redevelopment will be funded through a scheme called public dividend capital (PDC). Applying for PDC funding is the cheapest and most efficient way for us to pay for the work.\nWhat is a local care centre?\nAs part of the Better Healthcare Closer to Home initiative, NHS South West London will be building four local care centres, which will provide a range of services, including diagnostic tests, e.g. blood testing and x-rays, and outpatient services.\nThe centres, which will be managed by NHS South West London, will be spread across Sutton and Merton, including one which will be incorporated in the new building on the St Helier site.\nWho is involved?\nWe are working very closely with patients, patient representatives, staff, volunteers, local politicians, local councillors and other stakeholders to make sure that the redevelopment meets their needs.\nA Project Board has also been established to offer advice and support to the scheme and includes representatives from the Trust, NHS South West London, London Borough of Sutton, Sutton Local Involvement Network (LINks), Merton LINks and staff unions. The papers of their meetings are available below.Â \nLatest update\nThere is an absolute commitment at our Trust, as well as with our local NHS and GP partners, to redevelop the St Helier Hospital site.\nÂ \nWhilst we have developed plans to do this, the Department of Health have recently contacted us to confirm that they need to better understand how healthcare services in south west London and north Surrey might change before giving us the go ahead.\nÂ \nThese changes come under the umbrella of the Better Services Better Value review, which could lead to the services provided by St Helier Hospital being different in the future.\nÂ \nIf this was to be the case, then the scale and shape of the redevelopment might change.\nWe expect more clarity shortly, with Better Service Better Value due to announce their proposed options for public consultation (for the future of NHS services in south west London and north Surrey)Â later inÂ 2013.\nÂ \nSubject to what this means for St Helier Hospital, we would hope to be able to start work on the site as soon as possible.\nFor more information\nThe best way to keep up-to-date with our plans to redevelop St Helier is by reading the project newsletter (see below). You can subscribe to receive these by calling 020 8296 2406 or by emailing communication@esth.nhs.uk.\nRequest a speaker\nWe would welcome requests for members of the St Helier redevelopment project team to attend meetings of local community groups and other stakeholders to talk about the project and to take questions.\nPlease contact Sarah Dicker on 020 8296 2406 or by emailing communication@esth.nhs.uk to request a speaker.\nDocuments\nRedeveloping St Helier Hospital Â» 12 July 2010\nCurrent status of town planning approval - SHD 41/10\nSummary:\nFile Size:\n46KB\nFile Type:\napplication/pdf\nCreated:\n13 July 2010\nLast Modified:\n13 July 2010\nReturn to List\nDownload This Item\nSt Helier update - issue 03\nSummary:\nWelcome to the third issue of St Helier update, a newsletter to keep you informed about our plans to spend millions of pounds redeveloping St Helier.

When they won one of their best home matches in history against Toulouse in the Heineken Cup they looked as though they could beat anyone. But being defeated by Newcastle Falcons at Kingsholm at the weekend was a far cry from their Toulouse success earlier in the season.\nThings started to go wrong back in October when the Cherry and Whites had consecutive home and away losses to Leicester, Saracens, Exeter, Toulouse, Harlequins and Newcastle – one of many losing streaks Gloucester have had this season.\nThe reason their inconsistency has been so disappointing, is because they have arguably one of the best groups of backs in the Premiership. The likes of Jonny May, Charlie Sharples, Freddie Burns and Henry Trinder are all potential candidates for England in 2015, but uncertainty about the future of head coach Bryan Redpath has been circulating in the media in the last few days. Redpath himself hasn’t completely denied the claims but the club has said they have had no contact from Sale Sharks, who Gloucester will play next week.\nHowever, Gloucester won’t be letting that affect them as the season draws ever nearer to its conclusion. But what the club will be worrying about more is the fact they have dropped down to seventh in the Aviva Premiership table and have had three consecutive losses. Exeter travelled to Kingsholm three weeks ago and narrowly beat their local rivals by one point. Next, Gloucester made a trip to Adams Park to take on Wasps who they also narrowly lost to. And thanks to a late try, Newcastle also beat Gloucester on Saturday.\nThey have now got themselves into a scrap for Heineken Cup rugby with Sale Sharks who they will have a crucial match with next week.\nGloucester’s new signings would be disappointed not to be playing elite European rugby next season. England star Ben Morgan, Leicester’s Billy Twelvetrees, Brumbies hooker Huia Edmonds and Tongan powerhouse Sione Kalamfoni are just a handful of new signings to come in over the summer.\nThese new signings are essential given the number of losses the club is set to experience in the coming months, with Luke Narraway, Alasdair Strokosch, and Scott Lawson all leaving Kingsholm at the end of the season. Nothing is yet confirmed but it is expected that former England centre Mike Tindall and Samoa’s Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu will also leave the club in the summer.\nThis leaves Gloucester with a big hole to fill but the Kingsholm new boys will no doubt become fans favourites. Speculation has also arisen about Gloucester potentially signing All Black legend Jimmy Cowan as Scottish scrum-half Rory Lawson could also be departing.\nWith all of this considered, Gloucester should be pressing for a play-off spot next season and hopefully some silverware. They have featured in the LV= Cup final for the last three years but this year failed to do so, not making it past the group stages of the competition – another disappointing failure.\nGloucester is a club glittered in history. It is a rugby city and the fans and atmosphere on matchday is incredible. When a club of their calibre is underachieving so drastically, the clubs reputation takes a beating. Despite all of this, Gloucester have enjoyed some big wins this season. Victories over West-Country rivals Bath, the Barcelona of rugby Toulouse, table-toppers Harlequins and more have been fantastic moments for the club and should not be forgotten.\nby Sam Durham\n7 Comments\nNick Hill / April 16, 2012\nGlos are flaky as ever! and Jimmy Cowan is not an all black legend.\nReply\nGarry Irwin / April 16, 2012\nGreat article Sam,.\nReply\nSam / April 16, 2012\nNick: Well he may not be a legend but he has just over 50 All Black caps\nThanks Garry!\nReply\nNick Hill / April 16, 2012\nMy comment was very picky i know! I just think Jimmy Cowan is a very average player in an awesome international team. 9 has not been a position of strength for the ABs for a while. Obviously he will be a good prem player but i wouldn’t expect him to make the kind of impact Evans has at quins.\nReply\nStu / April 16, 2012\nIt’s not hard to see what Gloucester’s problem is when you look at the lack of strength in depth among the forwards. U can have the best backs in the world, but if they ain’t got a platform to work from, then more often than not they wont win u games.\nReply\nSam / April 16, 2012\nNick: Sounds like the move is pretty certain now according to NZ Media http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/6753631/Gloucester-reel-in-All-Black-No-9-Jimmy-Cowan\nReply\njames / April 17, 2012\nJust been confirmed my Gloucester this morning, Cowan will be wearing red and white next season.\nReply\nLeave a Reply to Garry Irwin Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

        "content_text":["Businesses reminded of imminent VAT rise | WJ James & Co | Brecon\nSkip to Navigation\nNews Desk\nThe latest tax, employment, business and economic news affecting firms and individuals alike. Updated each day.\nHome News desk Businesses reminded of imminent VAT rise\nBusinesses reminded of imminent VAT rise\n21 Dec 10\nBusinesses are being urged to ready themselves for the increase in the standard rate of VAT set for 4 January.\nThe standard rate of VAT will climb from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent on 4 January.\nJim Harra, HM Revenue & Customs director of VAT, said: \"With the Christmas and New Year holidays almost upon us, businesses must be ready to implement the increase to the standard rate of VAT.\n\"Don't leave it until the last minute to make any necessary changes to your book-keeping and accounting systems including invoicing and tills. You also need to make sure your staff are fully aware that the new 20 per cent rate must be charged from 4 January.\"\nThe increase was announced in June's emergency Budget and means that any sales of standard-rated goods or services made on or after 4 January 2011 must carry a VAT charge of 20 per cent.\nThere are no changes to the reduced rate (5 per cent), zero rate (0 per cent) or existing VAT exemptions.\nThe 20 per cent VAT rate applies for all sales made after midnight on 4 January 2011. The temporary relief allowed on New Year's Eve 2009, allowing retailers to carry on using the old rate if they remained open for business after midnight, will not apply on this occasion.\nIf you are a retailer, you must clearly show your prices inclusive of VAT. However, following a VAT rate change you will have up to 28 days to adjust your prices. So, from 4 January 2011 to 1 February 2011, you can put up a notice to let your customers know that an adjustment will be made at the till to account for the VAT rate change.\nFor cash businesses that work out their VAT charge using the fraction - that is, calculating the amount of VAT from a VAT-inclusive total - the ratio will be 1/6 as from 4 January.\nRetailers will need to apply the new 20 per cent charge for all takings that are received on or after 4 January next year. If a customer pays on or after 4 January for an item that has been collected or delivered in advance of that date, then the sale is deemed to have occurred before the change-over and the old 17.5 per cent rate applies.\nIn the case of VAT invoices, the 20 per cent charge must appear on bills raised on or after 4 January.\nThere are, of course, issues over sales that span the change-over date. A business that supplies either goods or services before 4 January but issues an invoice after 4 January can opt to apply the old 17.5 per cent rate if they wish.\nWhere a business begins work on a job before 4 January but doesn't complete the project until after that date, it may charge VAT at 17.5 per cent for time and resources up to 3 January and VAT at 20 per cent on or after 4 January. But businesses will be under an obligation to show that the division between the two rates is fair and accurate.\nWhere the supply of services is continuous - say, leasing equipment or a consultancy service - a business must charge VAT at 20 per cent on invoices issued and payments received on or after 4 January. It can, however, apply the 17.5 per cent rate for the services that have been supplied up to 3 January and the 20 per cent rate thereafter.\nShould a business send an invoice or take payment in advance of 4 January for services or goods that are then supplied on or after that date, the 17.5 per cent charge should normally be charged. But they can, if they choose, charge at 20 per cent.\nBusinesses that use the cash accounting scheme will have to separate payments taken on or after 4 January from sales made before the change-over date. This is because the old rate will apply to them.\nThose operating the flat rate scheme will need to be aware of the new percentage rates that take effect as from 4 January. Firms with a VAT-exclusive turnover of £150,000 can use the flat rate scheme. Since the threshold is VAT-exclusive, the new rate won't affect it. But firms with a VAT-inclusive turnover of £225,000 must leave the scheme. That threshold will change to £230,000 after 4 January in order to take the VAT increase into account.\nSimilarly, the qualifying thresholds for payments on account - where there is an annual VAT liability in excess of £2 million - are to be amended to reflect the higher rate of VAT.\nVAT return and payment dates, be they monthly, quarterly or annual, will remain unchanged. For periods that cover the change-over date, businesses will need to combine the sales that carry the 17.5 per cent charge and the 20 per cent charge in order to calculate the total VAT sales figure.\nThere is a relatively simple method for calculating the effect that the VAT lift will have on prices.\nThis is to multiply old prices by 120/117.5. An item that costs £1000 is multiplied by 120 to give 120,000. It is then divided by 117.5 to produce £1021.28.\nBusinesses do not have to pass the increase on to customers but they will have to pay HM Revenue and Customs the additional VAT.\nThe emergency Budget introduced 'anti-forestalling' rules which are intended to prevent businesses and customers taking unfair advantage of the change in VAT rate.\nIn those instances where the rules apply, a supplier that has charged VAT at 17.5 per cent will be required to issue a supplementary invoice for an extra 2.5 per cent of VAT on 4 January.\nThe extra charge comes into effect when a customer is unable to reclaim the VAT charge and one or more of the following conditions apply: the supplier and customer are 'connected' - such as associated businesses - or the supplier funds the purchase - perhaps by lending the customer money - or a VAT invoice is issued but is not due to be paid for at least six months, or a pre-payment of above £100,000 is made before 4 January for goods or services to be delivered once the VAT increase has happened.\nHome\nAbout us\nOur approach\nServices\nTestimonials\nNews desk\nGuides\nContact us\nBusiness tax\nGovernment Announcements\nPAYE and NI\nPensions savings investments\nPersonal tax\nRegulations\nVAT\nRelated guides\nGroup VAT registration\nAn introduction to VAT\nPenalties for late returns\nValue added tax\nIssuing VAT invoices\nRelated services\nVAT Returns and Planning\nBusiness Start-ups\nUtilities\nRegister\nLogin\nSecondary links\nTerms and conditions\nCopyright\nAccessibility statement\nSite map\nSearch\nCookies\nBishop House, 10 Wheat Street\nBrecon, Powys\nLD3 7DG\nTel     01874 622381\nFax    01874 622427\nEmail enquiries@wjjames.co.uk"],

It affects several Lakeland several farms including one at Loweswater.\nThe farmers have remained stoical, and have quietly got on with things.\nBut many of us have only been reminded of the consequences this week as a result of a scientific report that thyroid cancer rates among children and young adults in Cumbria rose 12-fold after the disaster.\nThe scientists stress that fewer than 10 cases of the rare disease in Cumbria were found, but that they were â€œstatistically significantâ€� and â€œconsistent with a casual association with the Chernobyl accident.â€�\nWhich is a stern reminder that even if a case can be made for nuclear power to be the â€œcleanâ€� answer to the energy crisis, the long term disposal of nuclear waste and the safety of nuclear sites have to be paramount.\nIt seems that Chernobyl will continue to haunt and inform us for some time yet.\n* HAIL THIS TRADITION\nThe best Uppies and Downies series for a good 20 years has just finished.\nCatherine Malloy became the first woman in its 300 years to hail the ball.\nThis traditional rough and tumble deserves to play its part in Workington life for years to come, whatever happens to the Cloffocks site.

One of the most popular and well researched sports supplement, the main benefit of Creatine is that it increases fat free mass while improving anaerobic and aerobic performance. With the Nutrisport Creatine Bombs, you get all the benefits of Creatine in an easy to chew capsule!\nEach flavoured, chewable Nutrisport Creatine Bomb is 1000mg of creatine tableted with a dextrose delivery system (1000mg dextrose). Taking creatine with complex carbohydrate or sugar increases the production of insulin and therefore the absorption of creatine.\nCreatine is the energy fuel for all sports that involve speed or power. A small quantity is produced naturally in the body, and some is found in red meat and fish (not vegetables). Increasing the amount of creatine in the muscles, through supplementation, will allow you to train/compete for longer. Taking creatine leads to increased endurance and lean muscle mass. The absorption of creatine is insulin driven.\nAllergy and Dietary Information\n \nSuitable for Vegetarians? Yes\nSuitable for Vegans? Yes\nSuitable for Halal diets? Yes\nSuitable for Kosher diets?

According to PNMâs 2009 10-K filing, the company reported an agreed-upon sale price of USD 620m.\nThe gas company is a subsidiary of utility holding company Continental Energy Systems, which has its main office in New York. Continental also owned Michigan-based Semco Holding, which owned gas operations in Michigan and Alaska. Continental sold Semco to AltaGas for around USD 1.1bn in 2012. New Mexico Gas is the only remaining subsidiary listed on Continentalâs website.\nContinental was backed by private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg in 2006; it received follow-on investments in 2007 and 2009 to buy Semco and the former PNM Gas. Lindsay Goldberg representatives could not provide comment before press time.\nNew Mexico Gas provides natural gas services to more than 500,000 customers in New Mexico and maintains about 12,000 miles of natural gas pipelines across the state.\nCanadian concerns such as EPCOR and Algonquin Power & Utilities are also logical buyers, as they have been active in the space, said a second industry analyst. EPCOR picked up some water utility assets in New Mexico, and Algonquin and Emera also invested in the Southwest with their acquisition of NV Energy assets in California. Pension funds could also be buyers, as they directly invest in utility assets as an alternative strategy, the analyst said.\nInfrastructure funds may also show interest, given their recent forays in the space, the first analyst said.\nIn December 2012, The Laclede Group and Energy Transfer announced a deal to acquire Southern Unionâs Missouri Gas Energy and New England Gas Company divisions for USD 1bn in cash and USD 20m in debt. Shortly thereafter, EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its natural gas distribution business, Equitable Gas Company, to Peoples Natural Gas, owned by SteelRiver Infrastructure Partners, in a deal valued at USD 720m.\nOverall, the gas local distribution company (LDC) space has been very active as of late and shows no sign of waning, said a third industry banker. The banker expects to see more deals come down the pipeline.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2013.

They are against me? But I didnât say to Rooney you will be a second choice for me. And they are against me?\nâWe are trying to get a player that a manager told âYou will be a second option for him. We are not going for Van Persie.â\nâThe fans donât have to be against me. If I say Ramires is a second option for me and he plays when Lampard is tired or injured â if someone comes here to get Ramires â nobody is upset.â\nAsked to clarify whether he felt the fault was that of David Moyes, Mourinho replied: âOf course.â\nIt throws the spotlight back on Moyesâ pre-season handling of Rooney and the interview in Bangkok that left the former Everton striker feeling âangry and confusedâ.\nMoyes said at the time: âI think heâs got a major role to play because we need to try and score as many goals as we possibly can. I think Wayne can play up-top, he can play dropped in.\nâOverall my thought on Wayne is heâll be key. If for any reason we had an injury to Robin we are going to need him.\nâI want to be able to play the two of them. I want to be able to use Danny Welbeck and Chicarito as well.â\nNumber two: Mourinho has reminded everyone that Moyes sees Rooney as back up for van Persie\nGetty\nUnited maintain the comments were not made as a slight on Rooney. But they have been widely interpreted as such and Mourinho now appears to be cashing in.\nIt places the focus once again on Rooney tonight when two of the Premier League superpowers collide.\nMourinho has defended his right to keep on pushing and went on: âIn every big team, you have first options and second options, and those second options must be very good players. Thatâs why we are buying another good player in Willian who will be in the same area of Mata and Hazard and Oscar.\nâOf course big teams must have second choices. Big players too.\nâThe point is if the players are happy to accept that situation or the players are not happy. A big club manager wants to keep players in a big squad.â\nRooney is expected to start and he will be at the centre of a storm with his desperation to defect to west London an open secret.\nIt is a win-win situation for Mourinho with Rooney unsettled if he stays and a player with a point to prove if he gets his way.\nMourinho, however, does not see it that way.\nâHe can be happy,â he said. âI donât know. Our objective is to try to get a player who we think is a good addition for us. Nothing else.â\nÂ \nRecently Published\nJose Mourinho says Manchester United shouldn't be afraid of selling Wayne Rooney to Chelsea\nChelsea set for Â£40m Wayne Rooney bid after Monday's Old Trafford clash\nWayne Rooney may use transfer loophole to buy himself out of Manchester United contract next summer\nPrevious Articles\nJose Mourinho says Manchester United shouldn't be afraid of selling Wayne Rooney to Chelsea\n\"I donât think the old-fashioned mentality of âI donât sell players to the clubs in the same countryâ helps the market,\" says Chelsea boss\nChelsea set for Â£40m Wayne Rooney bid after Monday's Old Trafford clash\nMirror FunPunts\nÂ \nPaddy Power Special\nSign up for free Â£50 bet\nRelated Tags\nIn the news\nChelsea transfer news\nManchester United transfer news\nWayne Rooney transfer\nPeople\nJose Mourinho\nDavid Moyes\nWayne Rooney\nDanny Welbeck\nTeams\nChelsea FC\nManchester United FC\nSee more stories you'll love\nYou've turned off story recommendations.

I am the first woman to get pregnant since she has owned the business (27 years) and to say she is clueless about the law would be an understatement. Before I left I said I MIGHT want p/t when I return and she looked horrified. I am trying to decide what I want to do and know I need to contact her to find out what the options are but am not sure how to put it to her, when I asked her what my rate of pay would be before I left she replied I would probably treat you as a locum . I can not plan anything until I know what my pay would be as I need to work out childcare costs, so How do I approach it ?\nI need to know,\nPay-how much and how my bonus would work if p/t,\nChances of getting p/t ?\nBut I don't want to end up saying I want P/T and her not accepting then having to leave before I planned to start as I can't afford to loose SMP (if that makes sense?)\nHow to I put it to her that p/t would be workable ? at the moment I am the only person doing my job but there is a trainee who is pretty competent and I think he could cope on the two quieter days on his own, she is always concerned about profit so if I work on the busy days only she would reduce costs but still have the staff when needed, is this likely to be a good suggestion ?\nThere are loads more things I need to think of but any help would be appreciated.\nAdd message |\nReport |\nMessage poster\nflowery\nWed 18-Sep-13 09:05:21\nYou don't need to contact her to find out the options. You decide what you want to ask for and put in a formal request for it.\nYour pay would be pro rata what you were earning before, so obviously if you were working 5 days a week and reduced to 3, it would reduce by 2/5.\nChances of getting it? No idea obviously, without knowing the ins and outs of your role and whether it will work. Chances will be much much higher if you can demonstrate why your request will be good for the business, not detrimental, and if you put forward an option that is easiest to accept.\nNot sure what you mean by having to leave before you start if she says no.\nYou can't lose SMP once you've qualified for it - you don't have to pay it back if you don't come back to work.\nRead this section of the government website to see how to make a flexible working request.\nAdd message |\nReport |\nMessage poster\ndontyouknow\nThu 19-Sep-13 11:28:55\nNot much to add to what flowery said.\nIf the firm's finances are a bit of an issue then saying she would save money as she wouldn't need someone new to do the work on the other days does seem a good argument. Be careful you don't talk yourself out of a job - you don't want her to think the other person could do all of your work, presumably for less money.\nIn your position I would go through my finances, what I really wanted to do etc, then I would ask for an informal chat about it, rather than wading in with a formal request straight away (but you should make it clear to her that you have a right to make a formal request as she may not know). You could suggest something like a three month trial period.\nAdd message |\nReport |\nMessage poster\nHekkie\nSat 21-Sep-13 09:43:13\nI'm in a similar position to you. I also work for a small company with little experience of maternity leave / flexible working etc. After an informal discussion my boss, she basically said no to going 4 days a week after m/l.\nGutted was an understatement!\nHowever, I put forward a proposal a week later, including a 12 week trial (using holiday I will have accrued whilst on m/l). I stressed how much want to return to work, how I love my job, that I'm committed to the company etc but also how I need a day at home with LO. I also proposed a more junior member of the team (who will be covering some of my role whilst i'm on m/l) retains some of the responsibilities she'll be given, thus alleviating my workload and allowing me to perform to the same standard, just over 4 days instead of 5.\nShe seemed to take my proposal seriously, although I am still waiting for an answer! I don't expect one until I'm actually on m/l early next year, but at least I've been honest re my plans and got the ball rolling.\nI would suggest doing something similar. Just try and put a positive spin on the situation and be honest. I always think employers appreciate honesty.\nGood luck!\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Google +1\nStart new thread in this topic |\nFlip this thread |\nRefresh the display\nShow pages\nAdd a message\nThis is page 1 of 1 (This thread has 4 messages.)\nJoin the discussion\nRegistering is free, easy, and means you can join in the discussion, get discounts, win prizes and lots more.

As you will know if you follow my twitter and instagram, last weekend me and the boy took a little trip to Paris! In my mind, I was going to be walking around in the sunshine in outfits worthy of Carrie Bradshaw or Gossip Girl and taking gorgeous outfit photos.......but in reality, well it was just too bloody cold to go anywhere without about 5 layers on top of whatever lovely outfit I had planned! The important thing is, I still tried, and I stubbornly wore this tut maxi skirt to climb the Eiffel Tower even though my ankle genuinely went numb with cold in the process! These are sadly the only outfit snaps I managed to take while I was there, but hey, at least they are in front of the Eiffel tower! \nI couldn't resist wearing this classic \"Parisian\" combo of stripes, tulle and a bright scarf. What do you reckon? Oh, and sorry about my weird face, I think this is my \"I'm-freezing-to-death-but-still-smiling\" look!\nSong of the day: Paris (Aeroplane Remix) - Friendly Fires >> LISTEN\nPosted by\nRosie\nat\n22:42\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\nLabels:\nconverse,\neiffel tower,\nootd,\noutfit post,\nparis,\nstripe top,\ntartan scarf,\ntulle skirt,\ntutu skirt\n31 comments:\nlucy jarvis4 April 2013 23:29\nGorgeous photo's!

Here is Joanne Payne's Brush with Elvis.\nI was in a bar with two guys from work doing my usual, 'no I'm not drinking' - then ending up having one, then another and losing the contents of my oversized handbag all over the place. I have a small grey and pink Chanel perfume spray and a matching grey and pink card holder that I foolishly love showing everyone.\nContinue reading the main story NaNoWriMo\nEvery November, hundreds of thousands of writers around the world participate in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), trying to churn out 50,000 words of a new novel in just 30 days.\nIn an era when people might go scuba diving in Bali or walking up Kilimanjaro, writing a novel is another piece in the fulfilment jigsaw.\nDoes everyone really have a novel in them?\nReaders' novels no 1: Indiscreet arrival\nReaders' novels no 2: Over the barricade\nReaders' novels no 3: Old women reside here\nI do rather fancy one of these guys but he's far too young for me although I still flirt outrageously with him. It's a bit of a game, an ego-boost if you like, that usually ends up being the complete opposite.\nThen out of the corner of my eye right across the room I am aware of him. A mystery figure, dark hair, strikingly handsome, cool, and he's looking at me. A sudden rush of adrenaline shoots through me and I turn back to face the bar trying to compose myself and pretend my reaction is blase. I get up to take a walk outside on some premise and am intensely aware this guy is following me.\nContinue reading the main story About the author\nJoanne Payne, 52, has three sons who are 18, 20 and 24. She works as a civil servant and lives in Carmarthenshire, Wales.\n\"I am still looking for my Elvis!\"\nOutside he is there by my side walking along with me. I can't believe this is happening after what seems like an age of loneliness and longing for a proper romance - I must be dreaming!\n'You're not leaving already are you?' he says as though he's known me forever.\n'I have to go soon or I'll miss my connection', I reply as nonchalantly as the question.\nI get a chance to really look at him. My God he is beautiful. He has thick, black hair gently flopping into a sexy quiff, almost natural-looking, like it fell that way when he got out of bed. He has intense cornflower blue eyes and long, thick black lashes around them. He is breathtaking and I can't help thinking what a pretty girl he'd be. Why are some men just so naturally beautiful? It's really not fair. His cheeks are slightly chiselled and his lips have a soft pout to die for. If it wasn't so corny I'd swear he was related to Elvis.\nInside I am molten gold.\nShare this page\nDelicious\nDigg\nFacebook\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nAbout Magazine Monitor\nThe Magazine's recommended daily allowance of news, culture and your letters.\nSend us a letter\nYour name\nYour e-mail address\nTown/city and country\nYour comment\nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all e-mails will be published.

This is a matter we will be raising with the chief constable.\"\n'Grossly offensive'\nIn response, police said that when a report is made to them \"regarding information posted on social media sites, officers will investigate and where a criminal offence has occurred, appropriate action will be taken\".\nEarlier on Friday, the police said the public order inquiry team had \"arrested a 57-year-old female in relation to offences concerning the sending of grossly offensive communications and other serious criminal offences in relation to intimidation and encouraging criminal acts\".\nIn her apology, Mrs Patterson said her comments were \"completely incompatible with the polices of the Democratic Unionist Party and what is expected of me as an elected representative\".\nMrs Patterson is a former deputy lord mayor of Belfast.\n'Restrictions'\nThe Castlederg parade, planned for 11 August, commemorates Tyrone's republican dead, including two IRA members killed by their own bomb in 1973. The march is backed by Sinn FÃ©in.\nHowever, unionists have described the parade as \"grossly insensitive\" and say it should not be allowed to go ahead.\nOn Thursday evening, the Parades Commission ruled the Castlederg parade could take place, but it placed restrictions on the march, re-routing it away from a war memorial in the Diamond area of the town.\nMore on This Story\nRelated Stories\nDUP calls arrest 'sensationalist' Watch\n02 AUGUST 2013,\nNORTHERN IRELAND\nShare this page\nDelicious\nDigg\nFacebook\nreddit\nStumbleUpon\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nMore Northern Ireland stories\nRSS\nMan charged with Dungannon murder\nA man has appeared in court in Omagh charged with the murder of a man in Dungannon, County Tyrone, on Thursday.\nPipe bombs found at two properties\nProsecution 'a stitch-up' says peer\nTop Stories\nUK embassy to shut amid global alert\nTwitter boss 'sorry' to abused women\nFracking protest enters 10th day\nAfghan attack targets Indian mission\nPickles backs renting of driveways\nFeatures\nLittle Wars\nHow HG Wells created hobby war gaming\nOne grass wicket\nBut could cricket have a big future in China?\nBiting back\nBrazilian researchers take the sting out of spider venom\nSummer campaign\nThe state of the race as leaders get in holiday mood\nMost Popular\nShared\n1: Rugby 'link' to early onset dementia\n2: Baby elephant makes big splash\n3: US issues worldwide travel alert\n4: How HG Wells created hobby war gaming\n5: Evolution 'punishes mean people'\nRead\n1: PM's online porn plan 'ridiculous'\n2: UK embassy to shut amid global alert\n3: Twitter updates its rules on abuse\n4: Rugby 'link' to early onset dementia\n5: Teens charged with raping girl, 12\n6: German boy finds 'mummy' in attic\n7: Patterson charged over Facebook post\n8: Brazil jail massacre police guilty\n9: Lads' mags 'modesty deal agreed'\n10: Biting back at killer spiders\nVideo/Audio\n1: Baby elephant makes big splash Watch\n2: Runners race up China skyscraper Watch\n3: BBC News Channel Watch\n4: Eryk Pelka \"I want them to suffer\" Watch\n5: Planes abandoned at Athens ghost airport Watch\n6: Monkey in a jacket spotted at Ikea Watch\n7: Prince Harry opens Royal Navy centre Watch\n8: Window cleaning at the Burj Khalifa Watch\n9: Film Review - the week's new films Watch\n10: War memorial airlifted onto hillside Watch\nServices\nÂ Mobile\nÂ Connected TV\nÂ News feeds\nÂ Alerts\nÂ E-mail news\nAbout BBC News\nEditors' blog\nBBC College of Journalism\nNews sources\nEditorial Guidelines\nBBC links\nMobile site\nTerms of Use\nAbout the BBC\nPrivacy\nAccessibility Help\nCookies\nContact the BBC\nParental Guidance\nBBC Â© 2013 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

When all wind turbines are decommissioned, the monitoring stations should be left in place, until the Mossmorran complex is decommissioned. The placement of the monitoring stations, should be decided by the local communities, through extensive consultations with the public by the local authority or the Scottish Government.\nSign Now\n142 signatures\nAir Quality Monitoring\nWe are deeply concerned that wind turbines around the Mossmorran complex may increase benzene (a known carcinogen) and other pollutants in higher concentrations in the local area, as identified in the research conducted by the University of Glasgow, putting the health of the surrounding communities at even greater risk.\nCurrently, one wind farm developer has to temporarily monitor Benzene & air pollutant levels, but this monitoring will only provide small reassurance and limited protections for the duration of the required monitoring. Mossmorran pollutant dispersal and flaring events do not happen on a constant basis, therefore, any benzene & air pollutant monitoring program on a temporary basis is useless, and only provides limited reassurances to the local communities affected, for the duration dates that the monitoring is taking place.\nWe, the undersigned, request that Air Quality monitoring stations are built in Lochgelly, Lumphinnans, Cowdenbeath and Auchtertool, to monitor Benzene & pollution levels from the Mossmorran plant for the lifetime of any wind turbines built around the Mossmorran complex. When all wind turbines are decommissioned, the monitoring stations should be left in place, until the Mossmorran complex is decommissioned. The placement of the monitoring stations, should be decided by the local communities, through extensive consultations with the public by the local authority or the Scottish Government.\nAll data collected by the monitoring stations should be made publicly available, online and offline, to allow individuals and other interested parties, to examine and monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.\nThis will help to clearly quantify the risks associated with inappropriate turbine placement next to industrial sites that disperse pollutants, and help provide reassurance that (a) the Benzene & pollutant risk is being taken seriously by the local authority and (b) the risk of benzene & pollutant poisoning is clearly quantified, openly and transparently.\n[signature]\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\n \nSign Now\nShare this with your friends:\nCredits\nMystique theme by DigitalNature\nPowered by WordPress\nAn Unltd project funded by Nominet Trust\nSSL Secure\nhref=”http://www.alphassl.com/ssl-certificates/wildcard-ssl.html” target=”_blank” title=”SSL\nCertificates”>\nsrc=”//seal.alphassl.com/SiteSeal/images/alpha_noscript_115-55_en.gif” title=”SSL\nCertificate”>\nTerms & Conditions\nWebsite Privacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDisclaimer\nContact\nMossmorran Perception Study\nThis survey is the start of an independent public consultation to try and assess the concerns and perceptions people have with regards to the Mossmorran complex.

you are searching for trade conservatory prices in and around Northampton NN5 bear in mind that 16mm Polycarbonate roofing systems are now only used in very basic conservatories it is not considered technically efficient any longer by most quality home improvement companies. Most provide 25mm polycarbonate as standard and will offer you the choice of clear bronze or opal tints at no extra cost.<br><br>Tip - If you are searching for trade conservatory prices then be aware that some suppliers of conservatories in and around Northampton NN5 offer self-build / DIY conservatories as a side-line to their normal installation business. Sometimes these are not really designed for self-build so always check and get recommendations from customers that have already purchased a self-build / DIY conservatory from them.<br><br>Tip â if you are looking for trade conservatory prices in and around Northampton NN5 when determining your budget consider how long you intend to stay in your home. If you are planning to sell in the next year or so you may want to spend less money. <br><br>\nThe term <a href=\"http://www.sunrooms.conservatory-buyerzone.co.uk/\">sunroom </a> means different things to different people.

        "content_text":["A Miniature History of the American Revolution: Battlefield Building\nA Miniature History of the American Revolution\nTuesday, June 1, 2010\nBattlefield Building\nAs noted previously, I will be bouncing back and forth between the northern and southern theaters of the war for the time being. At the moment, the northern theater side of things is concerned with the campaign to take Fort Ticonderoga. I haven't written about the southern theater lately, but work is occurring behind the scenes on the next battle. The battle will be one of those that was of a decent size, is frequently ignored by military histories of the Revolution, and has yet to be written about at great length. In other words, it's perfect for this blog.\nTo make the battlefield, I have so far 1) made an image of the area using ACME Mapper, 2) modified the image to include 18th-Century terrain features and to exclude modern ones, 3) divided a piece of poster board into 1000 (scale) foot squares, and 4) sketched the terrain features onto the poster board. The image below shows this work in progress, with trees and a building added to help give a sense of what the final product will look like. There is a large pond at left and a ridge at center. The various curving lines show either roads or streams. The whole thing will of course look a lot better once the poster board has been painted and flocked.\nDo you think you know which battlefield this is? Impress me by leaving your answer in comments.\nPosted by\nAD\nat\n8:45 PM\nLabels:\nmiscellaneous,\nterrain\n14 comments:\nTonyJune 2, 2010 at 4:59 AM\nSorry - no idea as to what battlefield, but on a recent visit to Cheltenham, UK. I saw a huge book that included illustrations of AWI battlefields. The book was illustrated with old maps - very similar to those you have on your Blog (sorry, but I am not sure what the title of the book was).\nI was looking for illustrations of AWI battlefield buildings as I was at the time building '28mm masters' to be cast in resin by Grand Manner.\nIf you know of any good illustrations that I could use to base new building on, I would be grateful.\nTony\nhttp://dampfpanzerwagon.blogspot.com/\nReplyDelete\nGilesJune 2, 2010 at 5:17 AM\nI have no idea either, but I'm looking forward to finding out!\nBest wishes\nGiles\nReplyDelete\nGeneral StaffJune 2, 2010 at 6:22 AM\nhow about a hint, the state would help greatly\nReplyDelete\nGeneral StaffJune 2, 2010 at 6:24 AM\nAt this point my best guess would be Guilford Court House with the elevations you have drawn.\nReplyDelete\nADJune 2, 2010 at 9:10 PM\n@ Tony:\nBattles of the American Revolution were fought in lots of different environments -- everywhere from the streets of good-sized towns to uninhabited wilderness. Some battlefields have iconic buildings associated with them, but that is the exception, rather than the rule. \"Generic\" log or wooden clapboard houses of the kind in use throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the U.S. would be useful in many cases. I'm sorry to say that I can't point you to a specific book or online resource. If you are specifically interested in the more famous buildings, below is a listing of some specific ones that you should be able to find online by doing a Google Image search or viewing photos at Flickr.com:\n\"Chew House\" or \"Cliveden\" (same building) -- Battle of Germantown\nMerriam house, Wright's Tavern, Buckman Tavern, The Old Belfry -- Battle of Lexington and Concord\nNassau Hall, Clarke Farm -- Battle of Princeton\nCortelyou House -- Battle of Long Island\nReplyDelete\nADJune 2, 2010 at 9:14 PM\n@ General Staff:\n\"At this point my best guess would be Guilford Court House with the elevations you have drawn.\"\nGuilford Courthouse is close. Today there is a pond and a ridge by the site of the \"third line\" at Guilford. However, the battle of Guilford Courthouse is better known than the one I have in mind. Here's a hint: The battle I'm referring to is in the same state (North Carolina) as Guilford CH.\nReplyDelete\nPaulJune 4, 2010 at 12:55 PM\nThe only other battle I know fought in NC that might fit your map is Moore's Creek. What did you use to modify the image you got from ACME mapper?\nReplyDelete\nGeneral StaffJune 4, 2010 at 3:00 PM\nI am at the same point as Paul. Also nice new look at the blog\nReplyDelete\nADJune 4, 2010 at 4:02 PM\n@ Paul:\nThe sequence of steps is roughly this: find the battlefield using ACME mapper, copy a screen shot (CTRL + PRTSC), paste the image into MS Paint, trace the terrain feature I want to keep with either the line or paintbrush feature, use the eraser feature to get rid of the rest.\n@ Paul & General Staff:\nMoore's Creek Bridge is a good guess. It's probably the second best known battle of the American Revolution fought in North Carolina, yet all-in-all, it's not a battle that gets a lot of attention. Unfortunately, it's not the correct choice. The battle I have in mind was like Moore's Creek Bridge in that it pitted North Carolinian against North Carolinian, but it was a good deal bloodier, and the outcome was long in doubt.\nReplyDelete\nShilaL_KapplerJune 5, 2010 at 12:56 AM\nSubtlety is better than force. ............................................................\nReplyDelete\nTonyJune 5, 2010 at 3:42 AM\nThank you for the list.\nTony\nhttp://dampfpanzerwagon.blogspot.com/\nReplyDelete\nChrisJune 5, 2010 at 7:53 PM\nWas the battle in question Ramsour's Mill.\nReplyDelete\nADJune 5, 2010 at 9:23 PM\n\"Was the battle in question Ramsour's Mill.\"\nWinner!\nReplyDelete\nGeneral StaffJune 6, 2010 at 8:42 AM\nGreat Job Chris\nhttp://swampfoxbrigade.blogspot.com/\nReplyDelete\nAdd comment\nLoad more...\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nAbout Me\nAD\nView my complete profile\nWelcome!\nThis is a blog about battles of the American Revolution.

In my opinion the best anagrams are those that seem to have a twist or funny meaning to them such as :-\nMother-in-Law becoming  \"woman Hitler\".\nOR\nClint Eastwood  becoming \"old West action\".\nThey then become the perfect way to present an entertaining as well as challenging table-top round.\n \nNow if you enjoy creating you own anagrams then you could spend many hours compiling a quiz sheet on such topics as \"Oscar Winning Film Titles\" or \"Stars of Soap Operas\".

        "content_text":["Joyfulgirl Makes: VeganMoFo Day 6: Puerto Rican Rice and Beans\nJoyfulgirl Makes\nCooking, baking, crafting and whatever else I feel like.\nSaturday, October 06, 2012\nVeganMoFo Day 6: Puerto Rican Rice and Beans\nI'm Puerto Rican, so I'm sure my mom would disown me if I didn't include Puerto Rican style beans with rice in my blog. This is pretty much what I grew up on. I posted about the this a couple of years ago here, but it bears repeating. Now, I'm sure every family has a different way of making it, but this is the way my family does it.\nPuerto Rican Style Beans \n1 15-oz can or 1 1/2 cups pink beans\n1 Tbsp Recaito (scroll to the bottom of my original post for more info)\n4 oz tomato sauce\n1 packet sazÃ³n (see note below)\nhandful of pimento-stuffed green olives (optional)\npinch of oregano\nSalt and pepper to taste\nSaute the recaito with the tomato sauce for 2 or 3 minutes. Add beans, olives, oregano, salt and pepper and enough water to cover the beans. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally until the liquid reduces a bit and everything is hot and the flavors are well combined. Serve over rice.\ni can has?\nThere's another way Puerto Ricans love to eat rice and beans: mixed together and cooked in the same pot so that the rice is yellow. This version often has pieces of pork in it, but it's equally as delicious without . \nYellow Rice with Beans\n2-3 Tbsp olive oil\n2 Tbsp Recaito (see the post I linked to above)\n1 cup tomato sauce\n1 packet sazÃ³n (see note below)\na few pinches of salt and pepper\na handful of olives or diced bell pepper (optional)\n1 (15-oz) can red beans, drained\n2 cups rice\nIn a large pot, heat the olive oil and recaito over medium-high heat. Add tomato sauce and sazon, salt, pepper, and olives and cook for a minute. Mix in the beans and rice. Add enough water so that it's about 1 inch above the rice. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for 30 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is cooked. The beans will have floated to the top, so just mix them in before serving.\nNote: Sazon is found in most supermarkets, with the spanish foods. It's usued mostly for color but it has other spices too. It does have MSG, so if you avoid foods with MSG, you can make your own blend of salt, garlic, cumin, coriander, and saffron. Or just leave it out completely.\nPosted by\nJoyfulgirl415\nat\n2:27 PM\nLabels:\nvegamofo2012\n1 comment:\nLizzie Bordello7:21 PM\nMmm! I have a friend who is Puerto Rican, and she makes the most amazing beans and rice - but I have yet to wheedle the recipe out of there. Apparently there is some ingredient that her dad says I will *never* figure out.

Call me on 01865 425494. Follow me on twitter: @OxMailTimHughes\nIt's Christmas in Midsomer (Midsomer Murders, Christmas Eve, ITV, 9pm)\nTwinkletoes, Time Lords, luvvies and Jane Austen characters will make the season bright. Tim Hughes finds out more\nThere are true blockbusters heading our way this Christmas. Here is our pick of the ones you wonât want to miss.\nSaturday, December 21\nStrictly Come Dancing (BBC One, 6.30pm)Â Trying to guess the winner of this yearâs series hasnât been easy â weâve been changing our minds every week. Now itâs an all girls final.\nSophie Ellis-Bextor emerged as an early favourite following a show-stopping Charleston, only to struggle with the jive and, according to the judges, the rumba. Natalie Gumede appeared more consistent, when she wasnât being dogged by illness and injury, and most viewers predicted she would be the recipient of the showâs first 40, until Abbey Clancy took the honours with a Saturday Night Fever-inspired salsa.\nMeanwhile BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid has also had a turn on top of the leader board with a dramatic paso doble.\nBut very soon we will learn who will lift the coveted mirror ball trophy. Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly are our hosts as the four remaining celebs take to the floor, hoping to impress judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell.\nBut itâs the public who ultimately decide who gets to follow last yearâs champion Louis Smith.\nSunday, December 22\nThe Whale (BBC One, 9pm) Martin Sheen plays Old Thomas Nickerson, a maritime veteran who recalls being a cabin boy aboard the Essex, an ill-fated whaling ship.\nCharles Furness stars as young Tom, and we see him dealing with everything Mother Nature can throw at him, from destructive sea storms to whales. Whatâs more, he has to carry out dark deeds to survive after being shipwrecked.\nMonday, December 23\nGary Barlow: Journey to Afghanistan (ITV, 9pm) As the title hints, the singer heads out to join service personnel at Camp Bastion, and experience life on the frontline. But while he might be there to boost morale and perform a few songs while heâs at it, itâs not an easy experience.\nGary joins the air traffic control team, drives a heavy equipment transporter, and goes on a 6am run with the troops.\nHe also pays an emotional visit to the vigil site which pays tribute to the British troops who have lost their lives out there.\nBut Gary raises a few smiles as he unveils a pop-up concert and, joined by the Royal Artillery Band, belts out some of his hits, as well as Michael Bubleâs Home and the Holliesâ He Ain't Heavy, Heâs My Brother.\nSenior Aircraftman Marenghi and Lance Corporal Shaun Fowler join Gary on stage for special performances.\nChristmas Eve\nMidsomer Murders (ITV, 9pm) Itâs Christmas in Midsomer, and Santa has brought DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) a present â a new sidekick, DS Charlie Nelson (Gwilym Lee). If the newcomer hasnât yet realised that heâs living in the murder capital of the UK, heâs about to find out, as even during the season of goodwill, the villagers canât stop bumping each other off.\nLatest victim is furniture-maker Conor Bridgeman (Jonah Russell), who is stabbed with an antique sword during a ghost-hunting party at a supposedly haunted manor house. Local historian Brendan Pierce (Les Dennis) believes the killing could be the work of Rose Wilton, a blacksmithâs daughter whoâs been dead for 127 years. A ghostly recording of a girlâs voice made on the night of the murder seems to back up his theory, but it seems there may be a few living locals with a motive as well.\nThe coppers discover that Conor was a serial philanderer involved in fractious negotiations with the owner of the haunted house, Simon Fergus-Johnson (Mark Heap).\nChristmas Day\nDoctor Who (BBC One, 7.30pm) A month on from the 50th anniversary comes Matt Smithâs final outing as the Time Lord.\nShowrunner Steven Moffat has promised viewers a fittingly dramatic farewell to Smith, whoâs made the role his own since his debut at the end of Tennantâs final episode in 2009.\nIt seems as if Moffat is living up to his pledge too â the universeâs deadliest species have gathered at a far-off planet, summoned by a message that reaches the Doctor at Christmas.\nHe whips Clara away from her festive meal to investigate â but what they discover alters the gallivanting Gallifreyanâs destiny forever.\nBoxing Day\nDeath Comes to Pemberley (BBC One, 8.15pm) It is a universal truth that people just can't stop tinkering with Pride and Prejudice.\nWhether itâs adding a scene of Mr Darcy in a wet shirt for a TV version, updating the plot for Bridget Jonesâs Diary, or rewriting the entire book with zombies, Jane Austenâs classic has been reworked many times.\nHowever, thereâs one homage that has impressed the most hardcore Austen purists â PD Jamesâ sequel Death Comes to Pemberley.\nThe crime writerâs acclaimed novel takes some of the bookâs much-loved characters and puts them in a detective story. And now to mark the 200th anniversary of the original novel, it comes to the screen in this three-part adaptation.\nThe action picks up six years after Darcy (Matthew Rhys) and Elizabeth (Anna Maxwell Martin) overcame their pride and prejudices and happily married.\nThey prepare for the annual ball at their country pile, Pemberley, but Elizabethâs wayward sister Lydia (Jenna Coleman) crashes the party, screaming that her husband Wickham (Matthew Goode) has been murdered. Darcy sets out to search the woods but finds a different body...\nFriday, December 27\nVicious (ITV, 9pm) Gary Janetti and Mark Ravenhillâs catty sitcom about luvvy partners Freddie and Stuart.\nWhile some sit coms need time to bed in, this was a hoot from start, partly thanks to showbiz veterans Derek Jacobi and Frances de la Tour.\nIn this festive special, the duoâs turkey dinner hits a few snags, what with Ashâs cooking, Violetâs (de la Tour) new lover and Freddieâs pending acting gig. As if thatâs not enough to cause indigestion, Penelopeâs (Marcia Warren) truth-or-dare secret could split the group.\nBest of the rest\nDownton Abbey (ITV, 8.30pm) Hereâs a strange one â the Downton Abbey Christmas special but it's set during the summer and the action doesn't take place at the Abbey.\nInstead, the Crawley family have decamped to the capital to open the doors to Grantham House.

The story comes from a study looking at a compound called 3,3'-diindolylmethane, or DIM, which is derived from cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.\nResearchers wanted to see if DIM could help protect rats against lethal doses of radiation. They found that irradiated rats injected with DIM survived longer than those left untreated.\nThis early stage study suggests that DIM might be useful in protecting against the effects of radiation, whether exposure occurs accidentally or during medical treatment.\nHowever, the experiment was performed in rodents. Far more research is required before it is known if similar effects could be achieved in humans.\nRadiotherapy is highly effective at controlling several types of cancer, but it can also damage healthy tissue,Â leading toÂ side effectsÂ such as fatigue and sore skin, although most of theseÂ are temporary.\nThis research could be the first step in producing a treatment that provides some protection against these side effects. Until then, we know cabbage is good for you in moderation, but whether it can protect against radiation damage in humans is open to question.\nÂ \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from Georgetown University and Wayne State University in the US and Soochow University and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China.\nIt was funded by the US Public Health Service, the Drug Discovery ProgramÂ at Georgetown University and a Dean's Pilot Research Award.\nThe study was published in theÂ peer-reviewedÂ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on an open access basis, so it is free to read online or download.\nThe Mail's coverage implied that cabbage might protect against the effects of radiation, which is potentially misleading. DIM is in fact derived from a phytochemical in cabbage called I3C.\nResearchers injected different doses of DIM into irradiated rats and mice. It is not clear how the doses of DIM used in the study relate to the amount of cabbage a human would have to eat to receive a comparable dosage.Â \nIf DIM proved effective against radiation damage in humans, it is likely it would be developed as a medicine.\nÂ \nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis was a laboratory study using rats and mice. Its aim was to test whether DIM could protect against the effects of exposure to radiation.Â \nThe authors point out that a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower is linked to a reduced risk of several human cancers. They say that DIM is already being investigated for its potential to prevent cancer.\nÂ \nWhat did the research involve?\nThe researchers conducted a series of experiments in irradiated rats and mice, some of which were injected with DIM and some of which were left untreated.Â Â Â \nThe researchers used different doses of radiation and various doses of DIM, either before and up to 24 hours after radiation.\nThe rats were treated with a daily injection of DIM for two weeks. Most injections were into the abdomen, but a further experiment tried injections given just under the skin.\nResearchers also implanted human breast cancer cells into mice and irradiated them, with or without DIM injection.\nÂ \nWhat were the basic results?\nThe researchers found that rats given the multiple doses of DIM survived longer than untreated rats. This was true whether the treatment started before or up to 24 hours after radiation.\nIn one experiment, while control animals had died by day 10, up to 60% of treated rats survived 30 days, with the higher doses of DIM resulting in longer survival times.\nThey also found that about half the rats survived 30 days if a far lower dose of DIM was given before exposure to radiation.\nInjecting DIM under the skin appeared to be less effective at protecting the rats against the effects of radiation, with fewer surviving to 30 days.\nIn the mice implanted with human breast cancer cells, giving DIM did not affect the growth of the tumours, whether they were irradiated or left untreated.\nÂ \nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers say that DIM appeared to work by stimulating repair of the DNA damage caused by radiation and stopping the cell \"suicide\" that occurs after radiation.\nThey suggest that DIM could be used by doctors either to reduce radiation sickness in people accidentally exposed to radiation, such as the accident that occurred at the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, or to prevent or reduce the damage to normal tissue caused by radiotherapy.\nThe researchers also point out that it is particularly useful that DIM has the ability to protect when given 24 hours after radiation exposure, as access to treatment may be delayed in an accident. They say DIM can be given to humans safelyÂ without side effects.\nÂ \nConclusion\nThis early stage rodent study suggests that DIM might be useful in protecting against the effects of radiation, whether exposure occurs accidentally or during medical treatment. However, the experiment was performed in rats and mice and it is uncertain whether similar effects could be achieved in humans.\nIt would be ethically impossible to irradiate humans so the effects of DIM could be tested, although research could be undertaken in patients undergoing radiotherapy for cancer. Far more research is required before DIM could be considered an effective agent against the effects of radiation.\nIf you have been recommended a course of radiotherapy, bear in mind that while the side effects can be unpleasant, in most cases they will pass once theÂ treatment comes to an end. Thanks toÂ advances in techniques and safety, long-term side effects are now rare.\nÂ \nAnalysis by Bazian. Edited by NHS Choices.

He added that the interest appears to be serious but the Apax approach complicates matters. The shareholder said he had not had discussions with Smiths management on the matter so far.\nA sector banker familiar with the group believed it was a mistake to turn down the Apax offer in 2011 and cautioned an offer at that level or higher will be difficult to achieve now. âI have never understood why Smiths felt they could turn down GBP 2.4bn,â he said, describing it as âan almost miraculously good offerâ. âI canât see that offer being topped this time,â he added.\nA second sector banker agreed it would be difficult for Smiths to sell below the Apax approach. âThey are going to have to put money into the pension liability and management is going to want some money to play with. Itâs a matter of practicality as well as reputation,â he said.\nBut this banker and an analyst said Smiths CEO Philip Bowman rejected the Apax offer outright because he knew the private equity group would have talked the offer down. âBowman realized that [GBP 2.45bn] wouldnât be the final offer,â the analyst commented.\nSan-Diego-based CareFusion [CFN US], which is said to be the main suitor for the division, must have come to this deal with the Apax price point in mind, the second banker said. But he questioned whether the US group would try to talk it down in negotiations.\nThe banker, who has approached a number of potential buyers following confirmation of the approach, said there was currently very little appetite among strategic buyers to do the deal, adding it was unlikely to be a competitive process. He said that the division, which provides medical devices for hospitals, emergency services and specialist environments, would not be a technology enhancing deal, but rather a cost-cutting exercise.â The only motivation is costs,â the banker said. He added that none of the strategic players with significant overlaps with Smiths Medical currently had the appetite for the cost-cutting exercise on the ground and redundancies required to extract synergies.\nThe market is facing challenges because of the new tax on medical devices in the US, coupled with anaemic growth, this banker said. But the banker believed that a synergistic deal would allow a bidder to reach or exceed the Apax approach.\nBased on a projected FY13 EBIT of GBP 193m and an average peer multiple of 11.5x EBIT, the medical division has a valuation of around GBP 2.2bn, the analyst said. Adding a 30% takeover premium, the valuation could rise to GBP 2.9bn. Given low interest rates in the US and the synergies from the deal, a debt-financed deal from CareFusion could be accretive even at GBP 3bn, he estimated, though he said this would be a âpretty punchyâ valuation.\nSmithsâ CEO has communicated to analysts that the companyâs approximate GBP 382m pension deficit as of 31 January 2013 has raised the bar in terms of the price the group is prepared to accept for its divisions, as any disposal would require a contribution to the pension fund. The net pension deficit fell from GBP 620m at 31 July 2012, reflecting asset returns and a slight increase in the discount rates upon which the liability is calculated.\nThe analyst believed Bowman would rather wait for discount rates to move higher to ease the pension issue before selling major divisions so that the bulk of the proceeds donât have to be handed over to the pension fund.\nThe first banker also noted that the arrival of new Chairman George Buckley could have an impact on how the situation plays out. âHeâs the real deal in terms of managing businesses,â he said. âI think he will come in with a view that previous management have underperformed and will want to put his stamp on the company, but will this sale be it? Iâm not sure it will be,â he added.\nThe banker also pointed to Buckleyâs background at 3M in healthcare, noting that he may view having a multi-industry approach as interesting and want to keep Smiths Medical in the group.\nSmiths has not made any statement on the situation since 31 May when it confirmed an approach for its medical division had been made. A spokesperson declined to comment.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@dealreporter.com\nor call Europe/EEMEA: +44 (0)20 7059 6160 Americas: +1 212 686-3076 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9714\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2013.

According to the Croydon Advertiser:\nâFormer Conservative MP Andrew Pelling is to be a Labour candidate at next yearâs council elections, the Advertiser can reveal.Â The former Croydon Central MP is to stand in the crucial ward of Waddon.Â Mr Pelling was MP for Croydon Central from 2005 and 2010.Â He stood as an independent against Conservative Gavin Barwell but lost his seat â finishing fourth behind his former party colleague and the Liberal Democrat candidate.â\nOfficial confirmation of this looks set to come later todayâ¦\nRelated posts:\nThe Tory PCC candidate shares on office with Andrew Mitchell â so the Labour candidate dropped by with a letterâ¦\nBNP nominate Tory council candidate\nAndy McDonald selected as Labourâs by-election candidate in Middlesbrough\nTory MPâs âDate Arab girlsâ jibe backfires\nBarnsley Central candidate announced\nDaniel Speight\nOf course Iâm no expert, but Iâve always suspected that a lot of the problems in the Christian religion date to St. Paulâs conversion on the road to Damascus.\ncrosland\nHmm, I thought the conversion of Saul was amongst other things to highlight that the Christian faith was intended for everyone, not just jews. So are we supposed to assume the labour party will get into problems because it is open to everyone and not just the original true adherents ??\nIf thatâs the case it started in the labour party a lot earlier than recent times â witness the SDP and their leaders â good old labour stock â through and through !\nLatest\nComment\nTax cuts for millionaires, higher council taxes for those on the lowest incomes\nBy Hilary Benn\nIn April, David Cameron made two big decisions. First, he cut taxes for millionaires. Secondly, he put up council taxes for those on the lowest incomes. Margaret Thatcherâs Poll Tax, which arguably ended her premiership, was utterly regressive. It forced the poor, the disabled, carers, widows and others to pay taxes they simply could not afford. David Cameron and Eric Pickles have repeated this mistake.

It demutualised in 1997 â it became Northern Rock, and lost the lot in 11 short years. Now Newcastle are sponsored by Wonga rather than their local building society.

So that’s what he’s doing: Advertising programmes have been sliced; product offerings reduced; staffing levels cut and employee training brought to nearly a standstill.\nAt the same time, some wild sales offers are being made online – you might have seen these offers floating about on the internet, for example “rooms for only £10”.\nElsewhere on this blog I try to encourage you to think of your marketing expenditure as an investment, not a cost. To do this effectively means you have to prepare it and measure it as an investment. You’re not a bank, no government is going to come and bale you out. You’re not a bank, with a bit of luck you might actually have a sustainable business model.\nBut unless you treat your marketing efforts with the respect they deserve, your other investments (in the fabric of your property for example) will be exposed to even greater risks.\nThe respect you need to demonstrate is based on several factors:\nYou need to be patient – marketing isn’t an instant fix.\nYou need to be well prepared – marketing is not a discipline for the careless or feckless (although I grant you these characteristics are frequently displayed by people involved in marketing)\nYou need to make a plan – unplanned marketing usually doesn’t work. When it does work, you’ll have no idea why so you won’t be able to repeat the experience and reap the benefits.\nYou need to work your plan – Your marketing plan is the part of your business that brings new money in the form of new customers. This means that your marketing plan can cause revenue in to your business. But only if you work it hard.\nThis doesn’t mean you cut the life out of your marketing budget.\nIt is a source of some amusement amongst my colleagues that hoteliers in particular are notable for spending six or seven figures on a refurbishment designed to maintain or improve their business performance for the next five to ten years, but will then baulk at the thought of spending three figures on telling people why they should buy it.\n…but over our dram, it emerged that my hotelier friend had made dramatic cuts to his marketing budget. One of the things he cut was the frequency of his conversation with his customers: Advertising is now 10% of what it was; website expenditure has been cut to 5% of last years’ figure and direct mail campaigns that were so successful last year have been cut to one delivery every six months, instead of one every month.\nIn effect, he is saying to existing and prospective customers,\n“Listen very carefully, I shall say this only once”\nWhat a pity. The money he’s planning to spend will be wasted, because it simply isn’t enough. It’s not causing enough frequency in his messages to his customers.\nBecause whether you like it or not, a lot of marketing is about repetition, whether online or offline doesn’t matter. Repetition matters.\nYou see, the people at whom you’re pointing those adverts or sending those emails or targeting with your mailbox flyers will not respond to a message delivered only once.\nThey do not listen carefully.\nThey will not notice your beautifully crafted (ha! If only…) marketing messages.\nOnce. Is not enough.\nYou need to nag your prospects, you need to say it over and over and again and again. There are simply too many marketing messages competing for their attention.\nOnce is not enough to make them understand the connections required between their needs, your product and why they should buy it from you.\nOnce is not enough to get the sales you need to protect your investment in your business.\nIf new customers are going to be harder to find, you need to step up your investment in marketing, not cut it.\nThere are enough challenges facing your business today. Knocking the living daylights out of your marketing budget just adds to the challenges you face.\nPosted by HotelBlogger\n0 Trackbacks\nTrackback specific URI for this entry\nNo Trackbacks\n0 Comments\nDisplay comments as (Linear | Threaded)\nNo comments\nThe author does not allow comments to this entry\ni3Theme 1.6 is designed by N.Design Studio, customized by MangoOrange™, supported by Web Hosting Geeks,\nsponsored by Web Hosting Reviews & Free Coupons and Cheap Web Hosting.\nPorted to Serendipity by YellowLed.\nCalendar\nApril '13\nMon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28\n29 30          \nSkype Me!\nLinkedin\nContact information\nSyndicate This Blog\nRSS 0.91 feed\nRSS 1.0 feed\nRSS 2.0 feed\nATOM 0.3 feed\nATOM 1.0 feed\nRSS 2.0 Comments\nOPML 1.0 feed\nCategories\nDistribution\nHotel Marketing\nHotel Operations\nHotel Trends and News\nQuestions\nAll categories\nBlog Administration\nOpen login screen\nArchives\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nRecent...\nOlder...\nHotelSphere Copywriting\nHotelSphere website\nHotel Channel Management\nHotel Channel Management\nVisit this group\nBlog Catalog\nMeta\nentries (RSS)\nComments (RSS)\nLogin"],

So her saying she's \"a little bit\" gutted about missing out on the anniversary could be her [i]hinting[/i] that she wants to return. And yes, if Lauren Crace was in a new TV programme/ film/ theatre show etc., then there would be some sort of news about it somewhere online or elsewhere. They have to advertise for it somewhere, obviously! Anyway, even if she does have another job that doesn't mean she can't work in EastEnders! Larry Lamb works in both Gavin and Stacey and EastEnders, and he seems to cope fine! Look, what I'm saying is that Lauren Crace isn't the problem, it's the producers who decide whether or not she comes back or not. And, well, if they want a ratings grabber then having a much-loved, 'dead' character coming back should be high on their list of possible storylines![/quote]\n \n \nOptions\nDisable BBCode\nDisable smilies\nDo not automatically parse URLs\nExpand view\nTopic review: Welcome Guests\nQuote Snape\nRe: Welcome Guests\nby Snape » Wed Aug 10, 2011 4:04 am\nThis site would be the perfect place for all the penetation i sir snape shall induldge in monas tent........oh noo wait this is the place of mrs krazer! this is a sacred place then cause all that mrs krazer does, thinks or wants is sacred, lovley, elegandt and brilliant\nCome mona we need to take our penetration elsewhere........mona? mona?

Torres is good though.\nAs a former Chelsea season ticket holder married to a former Arsenal season ticket holder - Reading is our neutral team but we are both members rather than ticket holders. We were going to take our sons there or Basingstoke - the language at the Bridge/Emirates can get a bit ripe.\n29-09-2008, 03:10 PM\n(This post was last modified: 29-09-2008 03:18 PM by Pic.)\nPost: #4\nPic\nSenior Member\nPosts: 653\nJoined: Feb 2008\nReputation: 2\nRE: Footie Chat\nWell well a football thread. How come it took a woman to start it, whats the matter with us males?\nChelsea for the Prem. Celtic to make it 4 in a row in the SPL. Reading may sneak up if they keep getting 'goals' like the one against Watford. Basingstoke to be relegated.\nAs an slight aside, does anybody else think Sheffield United should be charged with bringing the game into disrupute?\nCalm down dear.

Man City will discover, like Chelsea and others before them, that money cannot buy any player in the world - Ronaldinho chose Barca over Manu for example - cos for some the lure of the really glamorous clubs and playing in Italy or Spain sure beats Manchester.\nArsenal will play pretty football but probably fade away, it'll be Chelsea or Utd for the title. I hope Reading dont come up, As for the foreign owners dont really care - clubs in britain have largely been owned by wealthy individuals and does it matter if they're a pools company in Liverpool or a oligarch from Russia. Many smaller clubs have, contrary to popular belief, benefitted from the money Roman put in. Not all went abroad West Ham did quite nicely as did Southampton.

I do believe (hope) that it is Chelsea's year again - I think ManUSA will finish the season without a trophy. Fergie tends to need a good number 2. (sent you up there pic for a nice one-liner about getting stuck on the hard-shoulder with the tommy-tits).\nI'm being thick (maybe because I am a woman :rolleyes what have Sheffield Utd done - other than have Sean Bean as a season ticket holder (see ladies a reason to like football - I have sat near Suggs and had my arm based by Damon from Blur... oooooooooo).\nMr Licks has been very, very quiet about Spurs being bottom.....\n30-09-2008, 03:25 PM\nPost: #8\n40 licks\nMember\nPosts: 70\nJoined: Feb 2008\nReputation: 1\nRE: Footie Chat\nnot very much to say about us being at the bottom. last year at this stage derby had double the points we got. no team is too good to go down.bet mr jol is having a laugh now. i think wolves will win championship. sheffield utd have got the hump and you cant blame them for trying to get somthing out of a cock-up. oh one last thing RAMOS out by xmas\n[IMG]http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff114/commonasmuck/176x220_Tottenham_Hotspurs.gif[/IMG]\n01-10-2008, 08:00 AM\nPost: #9\nnon-stick\nPosting Freak\nPosts: 1,200\nJoined: Feb 2008\nReputation: 3\nRE: Footie Chat\nI have to admit to enjoyong the shenanigans at Newcastle.

We need to get back to keeping set lines that are changed and players get used to playing with people. We have proved that it works over the past few months and as soon as we changed to random lines our game becomes scrappy and appalling.\nI thought Hehir, Spike, Boxy and Ben had a good game tonight or at least those were who stood out to me the most with spike scoring a hatrick, ollie lomax scoring two and unfortunately my memory fails me with the rest of the scorers. When we did string something decent together the standard of hockey was really good it was a shame that for 90% of it we just didn't get into the game. It took the fight in the third to start getting us involved in the game and to get us some goals.\n« Last Edit: February 04, 2009, 11:26:35 pm by danny_kay1710 »\nLogged\nmick fern\nElite Member\nPosts: 2578\nNoisy but nice (?)\nVipers v Bombers\n« Reply #1 on: February 04, 2009, 11:24:58 pm »\nBombers won 7-0.\nLooked like it might be a long hard night at first with teh 1st period ending 1-0.

Mick your post was first posted so I am not entirely sure why mine is showing first :|\nEDIT: To defend my stance on the game, I thought the performance in terms of posession and goals was generally OK. But i don't think we looked comfortable. Take the vipers out of that game and put sheffield or whitley in there and i don't think the performance would have cut it.\nWe need to step up.

Let what happens in the game happen and leave it there when the game is finished. Several spectators on both sides decided that wasn't enough and I feel it only looks bad on the clubs. I also don't want to point the finger at anyone or get into the discussion of who started what.\nRight apologies for that!!

I also thought Scott had his best game for along time tonight.  I'd like to se us pplay with Scott in front of the crease nore often as I think he does a great job there.\nMy overriding thought is that Bombers show that the ycan play hockey good enough to beat anyone in this league but need to be more consistent.\nLogged\nCome on HamStars !\nKev Dawson\nHero Member\nPosts: 1401\nGender:\nHome Team: Billingham Stars\nVipers v Bombers\n« Reply #10 on: February 05, 2009, 12:30:40 am »\nVery true and you are right to highlight Scotts contribution tonight and in front of goal where he is good at being a pain in the ass for the opposition D.  \nI thought Ben again showed why he is a great prospect who deserves the ice time he is now seeing, maybe ice time he should have had some time earlier this season before but it seems he is grabbing the chance now its here and fair play to him for being patient and doing exactly that!\nLogged\nEat, Sleep, Watch Hockey.

It also paid for 23 state-of-the-art electric beds for patients who need extra support moving and six special birthing beds for the Trust's two maternity units.\nHalf of the mattresses are designed to support people of average weight, with the remainder able to support up to 50 stone (more than 317kg).\nAnd it's not just patients that will benefit from the new delivery, as the Trust has spent Â£50,000 on brand new electric 'profiling' beds. The Trust was one of the first in the country to get the beds, which raise up in four different sections. This flexibility not only makes the beds more comfortable for patients, but allows doctors to assess patients easily and means that nurses don't have to raise the bed manually.\nÂ \nDeputy Director of Nursing, Julie Sobrattee, said: \"The comfort and safety of our patients is our top priority, and the new beds and mattresses are really going to help us make sure every patient we treat is as relaxed, well-rested and as comfortable as possible.\n\"That's why we are so pleased to announce such a large investment into new beds and mattresses. We hope everyone coming in for a stay at one of our hospitals will be able to get better in comfortable and welcoming surroundings.\"\nThe money spent on beds and mattresses is part of the Trust's capital development programme, which will see more than Â£9.1 million being spent on upgrading hospital equipment and facilities over the next year.\nOther funds from the programme will be used to fund large projects, including spending Â£550,000 refurbishing Alexandra ward at Epsom Hospital, a Â£300,000 refurbishment of the day surgery unit at Queen Mary's Hospital for Children and a hundred thousand pounds upgrading staff accommodation for nurses and doctors.\nIn parallel, the Trust has recently launched a plan to spend more than Â£190 million developing the St Helier Hospital site and is developing a vision to spend up to Â£70 million at Epsom Hospital, which excludes any additional investment we might receive from third parties, such as charities.\nFor more information, please contact:\nCommunications department\nTel:Â 020 8296 2406\nEmail: communication@esth.nhs.uk\nOut of hours media enquiries\nPlease call 07975 232 380\nYour feedback\nPlease let us know what you think about this page.\nVery dissatisfied\nDissatisfied\nSatisfied\nVery satisfied\nExplore our website\nPrepare your visit\nAdult inpatients\nChild inpatients\nOutpatients\nPrivate patients\nOverseas patients\nVisitors\nQuestions & answers\nUseful information\nGetting to us\nAppointments\nWard visiting times\nWho's who on the ward\nA-Z of clinical services\nHospital site maps\nHelp and support services\nHospital facilities\nLocal health advice\nThe NHS Constitution\nOur performance\nRegular indicators\nInfection control figures\nPatient surveys\nStaff survey\nCQC registration\nKey standards 2012-13\nAbout us\nFacts and figures\nVision and values\nOur strategy\nInvesting in our services\nThe Trust Board\nSupport our work\nWork for us\nCurrent vacancies\nBecome a volunteer\nWork experience\nMeet our staff\nYour feedback counts\nWhat patients say\nNominate staff for awards\nLeave your feedback\nGet involved\nHealthcare professionals\nConsultants directory\nGeneral practitioners\nResearch & development\nUndergraduate education\nPostgraduate education\nHospital contact details\nSt Helier Hospital\nWrythe Lane\nCarshalton SM5 1AA\nTel: 020 8296 2000\nEpsom Hospital\nDorking Road\nEpsom KT18 7EG\nTel: 01372 735 735\nQueen Mary's Hospital\nfor Children\nWrythe Lane\nCarshalton SM5 1AA\nTel: 020 8296 2000\nSutton Hospital\nCotswold Road\nSutton SM2 5NF\nTel: 020 8296 2000\nOther hospitals\nRenal satellite centres\nTranslate this page:\nCopyright Â© 2013 Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust.\nTerms & conditionsÂ Â Â |Â Â \nPrivacy policyÂ Â Â |Â Â \nFreedom of informationÂ Â Â |Â Â \nSite mapÂ Â Â |Â Â \nHelp"],

The Scotsman was linking up once again with Bingley-based Smith in the St John Lee Handicap Hurdle, but his mount Stagecoach Jasper came down early on the final circuit.\nSome 25 minutes after the race Mania was still being attended to on the track by medics. With the covers up, there was a delay to racing following the arrival of the air ambulance. He was conscious following the fall and was put into the air ambulance on a spinal board before being taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for further assessment.\nMania tweeted on Sunday evening: \"Thanks so much for all the messages. I'm grand. Staying in hospital to get another scan tomorrow then should be home. #highsandlows.\"\nHis agent, Bruce Jeffrey, tweeted: \"News regarding national hunt jockey Ryan Mania, he will detained overnight for precautionary MRI scan tomorrow morning. Will update tomorrow. Ryan and his family appreciate all the kind wishes and would like to thank you all very much.\"\nPaul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, tweeted: \"@Mania450 is in hospital with friends and family. He's awaiting scan results. Fingers crossed not as bad as first feared. He thanks everyone for their well wishes. Further updates when we have them. #getwellsoon.\"\nMania received what appeared to be a kick between his shoulder blades and was described as very sore before going for further assessment on neck and back injuries. He was reported to be in a stable condition.\nClerk of the course James Armstrong confirmed Mania had been conscious and talking after the fall.\nThe Great North Air Ambulance confirmed its aircraft based at Penrith, in Cumbria, attended and took the jockey to hospital in Newcastle with a flight time of just eight minutes. A spokesman said the casualty had back and neck injuries which were assessed as \"severe/serious\" but he said his condition on arrival at hospital was described as stable.\nCopyright PA Sport 2013, All Rights Reserved\nEmail to a friend\nPrint this page\nTop stories\nRashid ponders Tykes future\nMania hopes to leave hospital\nInjured Clarke pulls out of Masters\nSecond night in hospital for Mania\nAguero strike gives City bragging rights\nSport\nFootball\nAthletics\nBowls\nCricket\nGolf\nRugby Union\nOther Sport\nWatch all the action-sport video\nNational Sport\nPopular\nMost comments\nMost shared\nJust one moment in time...captured forever\nWoman glassed in St Patrickâs Day attack\nWarwick shakes off winter blues with clutch of new ventures\nTopping out date set for Binswood Hall development\nInspirational teenager and coach wins another award\nFind out about sewer works road closures at Leamington exhibition\nWoman glassed in St Patrickâs Day attack\nSearch for:\n(Plumber, Taxi, McDonalds...)\nWhere?\n(town, county etc.)\n\"Business owner? - Claim your business and Advertise with us\"\nIn association with\nLooking for...\nFeatured advertisers\nJobs\nSearch for a job\nKeywords:\nSearch\nMotors\nSearch for a car\nMake\nModel\nAny Model\nPrice from\nÂ£0\nÂ£500\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£20,000\nÂ£10,000\nÂ£11,000\nÂ£12,000\nÂ£13,000\nÂ£14,000\nÂ£15,000\nÂ£16,000\nÂ£17,000\nÂ£18,000\nÂ£19,000\nÂ£22,500\nÂ£27,500\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£35,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£75,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£250,000\nPrice to\nÂ£500\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£20,000\nÂ£10,000\nÂ£11,000\nÂ£12,000\nÂ£13,000\nÂ£14,000\nÂ£15,000\nÂ£16,000\nÂ£17,000\nÂ£18,000\nÂ£19,000\nÂ£22,500\nÂ£27,500\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£35,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£75,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£500,000\nSearch\nProperty\nSearch for a house\nBuy\nRent\nBedrooms\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5+\nPrice from\nunder Â£30,000\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£60,000\nÂ£70,000\nÂ£80,000\nÂ£90,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£125,000\nÂ£150,000\nÂ£175,000\nÂ£200,000\nÂ£225,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£275,000\nÂ£300,000\nÂ£325,000\nÂ£350,000\nÂ£375,000\nÂ£400,000\nÂ£425,000\nÂ£450,000\nÂ£475,000\nÂ£500,000\nÂ£550,000\nÂ£600,000\nÂ£650,000\nÂ£700,000\nÂ£800,000\nÂ£900,000\nÂ£1,000,000\nÂ£1,500,000\nÂ£2,000,000\nÂ£3,000,000\nPrice from\nÂ£200\nÂ£300\nÂ£400\nÂ£500\nÂ£600\nÂ£700\nÂ£800\nÂ£900\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£1,250\nÂ£1,500\nÂ£1,750\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£2,250\nÂ£2,500\nÂ£2,750\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£3,500\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£4,500\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£10,000\nPrice to\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£30,000\nÂ£40,000\nÂ£50,000\nÂ£60,000\nÂ£70,000\nÂ£80,000\nÂ£90,000\nÂ£100,000\nÂ£125,000\nÂ£150,000\nÂ£175,000\nÂ£200,000\nÂ£225,000\nÂ£250,000\nÂ£275,000\nÂ£300,000\nÂ£325,000\nÂ£350,000\nÂ£375,000\nÂ£400,000\nÂ£425,000\nÂ£450,000\nÂ£475,000\nÂ£500,000\nÂ£550,000\nÂ£600,000\nÂ£650,000\nÂ£700,000\nÂ£800,000\nÂ£900,000\nÂ£1,000,000\nÂ£1,500,000\nÂ£2,000,000\nÂ£3,000,000\nPrice to\nÂ£200\nÂ£300\nÂ£400\nÂ£500\nÂ£600\nÂ£700\nÂ£800\nÂ£900\nÂ£1,000\nÂ£1,250\nÂ£1,500\nÂ£1,750\nÂ£2,000\nÂ£2,250\nÂ£2,500\nÂ£2,750\nÂ£3,000\nÂ£3,500\nÂ£4,000\nÂ£4,500\nÂ£5,000\nÂ£6,000\nÂ£7,000\nÂ£8,000\nÂ£9,000\nÂ£10,000 +\nSearch\nWeather for Warwick\nTuesday 09 April 2013\n5 day forecast\nToday\nCloudy\nTemperature: 1 C to 8 C\nWind Speed: 16 mph\nWind direction: North east\nTomorrow\nCloudy\nTemperature: 6 C to 10 C\nWind Speed: 8 mph\nWind direction: South\nHome\nHome\nContact us\nRegister\nTopics A-Z\nServices & Offers\nJobs\nMotors\nProperty\nLocal Business\nFamily Announcements\nSpecial Offers\nCompetitions\nBuy a Photo\nShop\nDating\nSave on your energy bills\nBingo\nReader Travel\nAdvertise With Us\nSpecial Features\nContact us\nHelp\nAccessibility\nTerms and Conditions\nDisclaimer\nCookies Policy\nSwitch to Mobile Site\nAll rights reserved Â© Johnston Publishing Ltd.\nThis website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissionâs Code of Practice.

Ally Cutler will direct.\nThe project has been made possible by a grant from Arts Council England and support from Cheshire West and Chester council.\nPrevious young peopleâs projects by Theatre in the Quarter include Some Sunny Day and Sweet Sixteen by Helen Newall, Garden Lane The Musical by Rob Edmonds and a film project about King James I last year.\nMatt Baker is looking forward to recruiting a dedicated team of young actors, aged 16-24. He said: âWhere the Wild Thyme Blows will be a very exciting Chester twist to Shakespeareâs much loved tale.\nâExpect all the charm of the original with an added heartbeat of 21st century energy, blended together with the most gleeful music.â\nThe play will be performed at The Forum Studio Theatre from August 23-25 and a full-time three week workshop will commence on Monday, August 8.\nAny young person interested in the project should contact Julie Elston at Julieelston09@aol.com.\nÂ \nRecently Published\nJigsaw Music Theatre Company students impress at ISTA (International Schools Theatre Association) festival in Porthleven\nYOUNGSTERS from a Chester theatre company have taken part in a national youth theatre festival.\nMatt Baker to present Stars on Sunday at The Laugh Inn\nTheatre in the Quarterâs Matt Baker of Chester nominated to carry the London 2012 Olympic torch\nPrevious Articles\nChester composer Matt Baker seeks choir of angels for Chester Mystery Plays in Miniature\nA CHESTER composer is looking for a choir of angels.\nComposer Matt Baker seeks choir of angels for Chester Mystery Plays in Miniature\nDelamere Primary Academy presents The Story of the Titanic\nRelated Tags\nPlaces\nChester\nEntertainment\nForum shopping centre\nOrganisations\nTheatre in the Quarter\nPeople\nMatt Baker\nRecommended in News Why?\nUK & World News\nThe day's news in pictures: November 01, 2013\nCrime\nProlific burglar jailed after country-wide spree\nCheshire West and Chester Council\nBridge repairs delayed further\nUK & World News\nAndy Coulson Trial: Methods to investigate stories revealed\nChester\nAdd sparkle to your life with our map of the region's fab firework displays\nWedding Gallery: Send us your photographs\nÂ \nOur celebration of your special day in pictures\nMost Read in News\nCrime\nProlific burglar jailed after country-wide spree\nCheshire Constabulary\nStranger warning after ten-year-old boy was approached by couple\nChester\nAdd sparkle to your life with our map of the region's fab firework displays\nCheshire West and Chester Council\nBridge repairs delayed further\nThe Co-operative\nHoole Co-op raid - man charged with armed robbery\nTrinity Mirror/Scottish Power Your Champions 2013\nÂ \nA celebration of your community heroes\nRecommended on the Chester Chronicle Why?\nUK & World News\nThe day's news in pictures: November 01, 2013\nCrime\nProlific burglar jailed after country-wide spree\nCheshire West and Chester Council\nBridge repairs delayed further\nEllesmere Port\nGritty rural backdrop to family drama\nUK & World News\nAndy Coulson Trial: Methods to investigate stories revealed\nObituary Request\nÂ \nOur free funeral report service\nGolden Spanner\nÂ \nList of approved garages in your area\nFollow Us\nContact Us\nSend A Story\nAdvertise\nThe Editor\nJournalists\nJoin us on social media.\nFor the latest local news straight to your Twitter, Facebook feed or e-mail inbox.\nFacebook\nChester Chronicle\nEllesmere Port Pioneer\nTwitter\n@ChesterChron\n@EPPioneer\n@chesteradverts\nContact the Chester Chronicle\nGot a story in your area?\nIs there something happening in your area you would like us to report on?

It was impossible for small family businesses to compete with the mammoth conglomerates that emerged.\nNow, 150 years on the reverse is happening. Small entrepreneurs all over the world are taking market share from big business. This revolution has become VOGUE because in the current economy, never has the time been so ripe that small and micro businesses are able to compete with some of the really big companies â¦. And WIN!\nWhat are three main things people need to do in order to create effective change in their professional life?\nCreate a vision for what you would like to do in your professional or personal life.\nSet goals for how you can achieve the things you want in your personal and professional life.\nTake the first step!\nWhy do people procrastinate and how can we stop?\nPeople often say, âSome day Iâll â¦â¦ start a businessâ, or, âSome day Iâll â¦..travelâ. When asked when will you do it, there will always be a perfect excuse, a BUT, that stops them! People need to ask themselves, what one thing could you do to take you on step closer to your goal? By taking one step towards your goal it bypasses the procrastination and gets you into action!\nWhat makes a successful business plan?\nAs Bev James says, âA business plan is your road map. It outlines where you want to be, how you will get there and what resources you will need along the way. A business plan should not be limited to when you start a business either; itâs a working document which should be amended as you grow.â\nAre men more better starting up business ventures than women?\nNo, definitely not. In my experience anyone can have the vision and start a successful business.\nHow can people become motivated if they feel uninspired by their professional life and their future?\nLook at the things you enjoyed doing and worked out how you could do more of the things you want to do and are good at.\nIf children are the future, what steps can we begin to teach them to ensure that they begin their professional career on the right track?\nTeach all that they already have everything they need and they can be anyone they want to be and achieve anything they want to.

By the time the thing goes into production, the odds are that it will bear about as much resemblance to the curvy model you saw at the Motor Show as your cleaning lady does to Cindy Crawford.\nRecent years, however, have seen a change of heart from the major makers, prompted mainly by the Japanese. They've shown that the `lifestyle` market, where it isn't necessary to please Mrs Jones from Surbiton (who \"doesn't want anything too radical, dear\") is just crying out for cars that look as if they've just come off the stylist's drawing board.\nOne such is Vauxhall's Tigra, launched in November 1994, following a rapturous reception to its appearance as a motor show concept car the year before. Though the car was based entirely on Corsa mechanicals, it was great looking and paved the way for a huge upsurge of interest in the small coupe market. Now it's available in increasing numbers on the used scene.\nModels\nModels Covered:\n2-door coupe, 1.4, 1.6\nHistory\nOriginal buyers chose between 88bhp 1.4-litre and 104bhp 1.6-litre power (the Corsa GSi engine). An automatic option for the 1.4 was added in February 1995. Little was done to the car throughout its life, though late in 1997, Lotus-influenced changes to sharpen up the handling were introduced.\nThere were plenty of special editions, with names like Verde, Blue, Marine, Bermuda, Chequers and (in bright yellow) MTV Summertime. GM stopped producing the Tigra in 2000 but sales of old stock continued until early 2001.\nWhat You Get\nAn excellent alternative to a boring supermini for not much more money. And a car that, from the outside at least, looks a great deal more expensive than it really is.\nClimbing inside the cabin brings you back down to earth; behind the wheel, it's pure Corsa. Nothing wrong with that of course; everything's well laid out and functional. Just a bit of a contrast, that's all; it's like admiring a Ferrari, climbing inside and waking up with a start, realising that you were dreaming in your Vectra in an M1 traffic jam.\nOpt for the 1.4 and you get power steering, a stereo, central locking, electric front windows and tinted glass. If you can stretch to a 16v 1.6, there are gorgeous alloy wheels, a passenger airbag, a special alarm, an electric sunroof, heated and powered door mirrors, anti-lock brakes and front fog lamps. I'd buy a 1.4 and pay extra for the wheels (though you'll find that many cars will already have them fitted).\nWhat You Pay\nRefer to Car & Driving for an exact up-to-date valuation section. Click here and we will email it to you.\nWhat to Look For\nWatch for poor fitting leaky rear hatches (you'll be able to tell by the wind noise). Also check the low-slung bonnet for stone chips (many will have been resprayed). The yellow MTV Summertime special edition models also suffered from so-called 'yellow fever'; basically paint blotching. Other potential problem areas include tired dampers and brake discs plus rattly interiors.\nMore serious than all these maladies however, was the well-publicised tendency for the 16v engines to self-destruct at frighteningly low mileage due to timing belt tensioner failure. This can happen without warning, jamming the timing gear, causing the belt to break and leading to an unscheduled meeting of the valves and the pistons. At this point, it's new engine time; whether Vauxhall pick up the tab depends on the age and mileage of the car.\nThe only protection from this is to ensure at the outset that the tensioner assembly has been inspected. Ensure too that when you negotiate the warranty that this aspect is covered for as long a period as possible. This is just one more reason to insist on a full and accurate service history.\nReplacement Parts\n(based on a 1.4 approx) A clutch assembly is around Â£85. Front brakepads are around Â£16, a full exhaust about Â£400 and an alternator (exchange) around Â£90. A headlamp is about Â£65.\nOn the Road\nIn terms of driving satisfaction, a Tigra can't hold a candle to a good Peugeot 205GTi. Which isn't to say that it can't be a hoot in the right conditions. Both engines offer equal helpings of fun on the road with handling and ride far superior to any Corsa. You can feel everything happening beneath you through the steering wheel and there's superb grip and poise in almost any situation.\nFind a long, clear stretch of twisting road, add a dash of driving enthusiasm and you've the recipe for more enjoyment than anybody has a right to expect in a car of this price. You don't need anything more powerful under the bonnet '' though Vauxhall contemplated putting a V6 there before the insurance companies stone-walled the idea (it's group 10 or 12 by the way).\nInside the cockpit (and you can call it a 'Â¿cockpit' with a clear conscience so aggressive are the swoopy looks), there's ample space for two people and their luggage and enough room behind for tolerant children or inebriated friends who want a lift home from the pub.\nOverall\nWho wants a boring supermini when you can have one of these? Find a good one and you've found a good buy.\nUsed Car Search\nin association with\nPostcode:\nPlease enter a Postcode\nMake:\nAlfa Romeo\nAston Martin\nAudi\nBentley\nBMW\nCadillac\nCaterham\nChevrolet\nChrysler\nCitroen\nDaewoo\nDaihatsu\nDodge\nFerrari\nFiat\nFord\nHonda\nHummer\nHyundai\nInfiniti\nIsuzu\nJaguar\nJeep\nKia\nLada\nLamborghini\nLancia\nLand Rover\nLexus\nLotus\nMaserati\nMaybach\nMazda\nMercedes-Benz\nMG\nMINI\nMitsubishi\nMorgan\nNissan\nNoble\nPerodua\nPeugeot\nPorsche\nProton\nRenault\nRolls-Royce\nRover\nSaab\nSEAT\nSkoda\nSmart\nSsangYong\nSubaru\nSuzuki\nToyota\nTVR\nVauxhall\nVolkswagen\nVolvo\nModel:\nLatest News\nThe all-new MINI Paceman\nBMW take more fleet awards\nHyundai HND-9 revealed\nSee more News\nÂ \nBuxton Advertiser Recommends\nBack to the top of the page\nNews\nSport\nWhat's On\nWeather\nPlace your Ad\nSubscribe\nSpecial Features\nDeals\nShop\nHolidays\nDating\nBingo\nBuy A Photo\nLocal news on the move\nKeep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site.\nVisit this website on your mobile to start enjoying it on the move.\nSubscribe to the Buxton Advertiser\nGet your favourite newspaper at a great low price.\nCall us on 0844 292 0216 or click here\nto start your subscription today!\nNewsletter sign up\nNewsletter sign up\nContact us\nIf you wish, you can contact us using any of the methods below.\n10 Scarsdale Place\nBuxton\nEngland\nDerbyshire\nSK17 6EG\nEmail: news@buxtonadvertiser.co.uk\nTelephone: 01298 767070\nFAQs\nTerms and Conditions\nDisclaimer\nCookies Policy\nSwitch to Mobile Site\nAll rights reserved\nÂ© 2013 Johnston Publishing Ltd.\nThis website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissionâs Code of Practice.

If one of your customers goes down you need to quantify the bad debts created by that failure as soon as possible.\nSay your accounting year end is 30 June 2009, and one of your customers fails in October 2009 leaving the sales invoices it received in April, May and June all unpaid. Where it is clear that you will not receive payment from the liquidators or administrative receivers of that business for those sales invoices, you can include the bad debt built up between April and June 2009 in your accounts to 30 June 2009. This applies as long as your June 2009 accounts have not been finalised by the time you receive confirmation of the bad debt. Any sales made to this customer between July and October 2009 will need to be written off in your accounts to 30 June 2010.\nThis is a clear example of business failure, but bad debts can also arise where your customer is still trading. Before we finalise your accounts to submit them to the Tax Office or to Companies House, we need you to undertake a thorough check of all your sales debts. Where you can identify specific debts that are unlikely to be paid, and you have made every effort to recover the money due, those amounts need to be written off in your accounts. This will reduce your taxable profits, and avoid you paying tax on money you are very unlikely to receive.\nVAT on bad debts can only be reclaimed six months after the due date for payment for the invoice. You must also have paid the VAT due to the VATman before it can be reclaimed. If you use the cash accounting scheme for VAT you automatically get relief for unpaid sales debts, as you do not account for the VAT due until the sales invoice is paid. Any business with a turnover of under £1.35 million can join the cash accounting scheme.\nemail this page to a friend\nprint this page\nadd this page to your favourites\n \nNext Steps\nPlease contact us if you need further advice, have any questions about our services,\nwould like a free consultation or a fixed fee quote\nCopyright © 2013 Saul Fairholm Chartered Accountants\nReport a bad link\nPrivacy policy\nLegals & disclaimer\nSite help\nSite map\nLogin\n "],

If your needs are beyond the scope of our parameters please contact us. Payment when required is through PayPal.\nYou may search purely for a Surname which looks for all instances of that name in both the male and female side. Alternatively you may search for a Full Name, which allows any combination of forename and surname.\nTwo wildcard characters may prove helpful where there is some doubt in the detail of a name. %, a multiple character wildcard, can be added anywhere, and is added by default to forenames allowing just an initial to be entered. _, a single character wildcard, is also useful where % allows too much variation. The Soundex or Metaphone algorithms can also be selected to be applied to the surname to search for further alternatives.\nEntering a year and range is not necessary but may help refine the number of marriage records found.\nYou will be informed of the number of marriage records found and to progress requires payment. Prices start at £2.29 for a single marriage record up to maximum of £52.19 for the current search limit of 500 marriage records.\nOnce payment is complete the results are displayed on screen and emailed to your PayPal email address.

        "content_text":["Living in Sanity Again: Wintry again\nLiving in Sanity Again\nThis blog is about life on board our narrowboat Sanity Again, cruising the inland waterways of the UK (mainly in the spring, summer and autumn) and living in a marina in the winter. It's the way I choose to write it; if you don't like it, there are many other boating blogs.\nPages\nHome\nBraidbar Owners Group\nNon emergency numbers\nCon man on S and W\nSunday, 3 February 2013\nWintry again\nThe wind's gone round to the North, the sky has clouded over, it's as if that faint promise of Spring never happened. Heigh ho, we didn't have any plans for today, so were able to loaf in bed for a while, then get up and amble gently about, restricting our morning trips to visiting the facilities block and going to the shop.\nOn my way back from this last, I met Stephen Piggot taking an empty gas cylinder for a walk (they don't have a dog) and whilst chatting to him who should come by but Trev and Rachael from Takt Up, which is now moored on Quail, somewhere near where Dolce was last year. They were accompanied by their third son (sorry, I didn't catch your name, doh!). We all managed to have a brief chat before the icy blast got too much and walking on was necessary.\nThings were just a bit better after lunch; Sheila and I took a constitutional round the marina, calling in at Midland Chandlers as we went. I'd not managed to get the gas leak detector spray from ScrewFix the other day, so was pleased to find that MC had an even better product, though just a bit more expensive.\nIn any event, the smell of gas has completely dispersed from the gas locker, a very good sign. I've not turned on the new cylinder yet; when it's a bit warmer, I'll do that and check the connector with the spray. It seems most likely that we'd had a duff valve on the old cylinder, but you can't be too careful. Since 13kg of propane now costs around £25, losing half of it to a megaslow leak, even if it safely dispersed itself, is highly undesirable.\nLabels:\nMercia Marina\nPosted by\nBruce in Sanity\nat\n16:25\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\nWhat do you think? \nNo comments:\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\nOur home\nSanity Again at Eynsham\nAbout Me\nBruce in Sanity\nI'm a retired clinical psychologist, now living on board Sanity Again with Sheila, my wife, and cruising the UK inland waterways, taking part in the community life of the Cut.\nView my complete profile\nOur eBooks\nWe've now got four books published:\nBuilding Sanity Again is an account of just that, based on the blog I did whilst it was all going on and with an evaluative chapter added.\nA Boater's Commonplace Book is Sheila's compilation of answers to the questions we've been asked during our time as liveaboard boaters such as \"Is it cold in the winter?\" and \"How far have you been?\"\nNew for 2013 we have:\nTales from the Towpath is another of Sheila's compilations, this time of all the funny things that have happened to us on the waterways over the last 35 years plus, together with some stories we've only heard about.\nPractically Cooking on Board is my cookbook, using ingredients and equipment reasonably readily available to the boater. No sous vide or liquid nitrogen here!\nIf you want to buy a copy for another kind of e-reader, just email me and we can sort something out.\nEmail link:\nYou can email me from here\nOur Plans: Spring and Summer 2013\nAll our plans for the first half of this period are now up in the air. My ENT appointment at Burton has just been put back to the end of March, so we're stuck around here until then. In addition, we need to get stuff sorted about the build and fitting out of our new lodge here at Mercia. Hopefully we'll get away in April to get some boating done at least locally.\nAfter that it will be on to Crick for the Boat Show at the end of May. Beyond that, we've no detailed plans, but would like to do Liverpool this year, depending on the weather and the Dutton's breach being fixed, of course, and the timing of the arrival of the lodge which won't be before the beginning of August.\nSheila's crochet\nSheila's principal craft hobby is crochet, especially porthole doilies. She can supply a range of these, and they are available for inspection on Flickr here.\nHow flattering (really, I'm chuffed):\nor you can use a feed

How would you describe your area of the Festival to someone who hasn't visited it before?\nThe Pyramid, Other Stage and Interstage is the 'physical centre' of the Festival but not the 'heart' of the Festival. It is the highest profile area of the Festival, but does not have the same atmosphere and 'Festival feel' that the other areas enjoy. It is more 'mainstream' - less 'pure Glastonbury'. The 2 largest stages - Pyramid and Other Stage are where the highest profile acts will give their greatest performances.\n2. Have you made any changes/additions for this year?\nThere are no significant changes to the layout or facilities in these areas this year\n3. Which of your acts are you most excited about in 2011?\nSo much to choose from - U2 is obviously going to be a amazing show and will bring back so many memories from my past and more 'youthful days'.  But Coldplay are a huge Act and Beyonce is sure to give a truly 'exciting' performance.  Then one cannot forget Paul Simon - a true 'legend', The Chemical Brothers and their fantastic music and stage shows, up coming Jessie J, Mumford and Sons, Plan B and even Fisherman's Friends - there really is something for everyone covering all musical tastes and genres\n4. Do you have any good food recommendations in and around your area?\nNot really.\n5. How/when did you first get involved with the Festival?\nI first become involved with Michael Eavis when I was asked to handle the Production Management of the Glastonbury Abbey Extravaganza with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra back in 1996. The following year I took over the Pyramid and Other Stage at the main festival. Now I am responsible for the Production of The Pyramid and The Other Stage and I supervise West Holts and the John Peel Stage as well. I still manage the Abbey Extravaganza in August and now look after the Pilton Party in September as well - so Glastonbury Festivals Ltd keeps me and my team pretty busy...\n6. What's the best thing about running an area at Glastonbury? \nThe huge thrill and high that you get from seeing a sea of smiling faces and waving hands when you look out from the stage into the crowd.\n7. And what's the worst?\nIt is a huge pressure and massive responsibility that takes over your life - in my case for 3 or 4 months of each year.  In that time I am pretty much an 'insomniac' and it can be very demanding on the patience and understanding of my dear wife, family & friends.\n8. Is there anything outside your area at this year's Festival that  you're particularly looking forward to?\nI think the Spirit of '71 Stage will be amazing and some of the big features like Cubehenge are 'must see's'.\n9. What's the best performance you've ever seen at Glastonbury?\nDavid Bowie at the Pyramid - I was a massive fan in my younger years and it was something very special to see him perform on one of my stages.\n10. Finally, what's your top Glastonbury tip for people coming to the Festival for the first time?\nSpend some time looking at the website before you arrive and study the various guides etc., so you can plan your time to make sure you don't miss out on the acts and attractions that you want to see.  The Festival is so huge that whilst it is good to be spontaneous, and indeed there are some amazing performances that you will just 'happen upon', it is a good idea to have a 'game plan' to make sure you get the best out of it and are not disappointed by missing something truly 'special'.\nClick here to read more In A Field Of Their Own Q&As\nBack to top\nTweet\n© 1997 - 2013 Glastonbury Festival |\nSitemap |\nInternet policy |\nWebsite accessibility |\nContact us |\nNewsletter sign up |\nWorthy causes |\nLinks"],

        "content_text":["MayhemUK Commodore 64 archive\nAdventure Creator          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1984\nAuthor  : Dale Disharoon\nRating  : 5\nRarity  : Uncommon\nComments: Make your own adventure. Of sorts. Let the computer design one, or you can build your own. Wander round the mazes, fighting creatures, collecting treasure and surviving, that's the name of the game. Not bad for a play every now and again.\nAegean Voyage          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1984\nAuthor  : Joyce Hakansson\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Scarce\nComments: This is a fun little game where you must sail your ship from Athens across the Aegean sea and discover new islands to pillage. Some contain monsters that will sink your ship however, and it seems half the fun is in guessing which islands yield prizes or enemies. Nice graphics if a little blocky, and tuneful music complement the searching.\nAlf in the Color Caves          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1984\nAuthor  : Joyce Hakansson\nRating  : 4\nRarity  : Common\nComments: A rather simple, basic avoiding game for children to play. Control Alf through the various coloured pipes, avoiding the nasties (only visible by their eyes) to reach the bottom of the screen. Nothing really taxing to be done, though the graphics are big and colourful and would attract a child's attention easily.\nAlphabet Zoo          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Dale Disharoon\nRating  : 4\nRarity  : Common\nComments: A game to teach your child the alphabet and recognising the similarity between objects and letters. As per so many of these, they look so old and out-dated in modern light, but were probably seen as cutting edge back then.\nBubble Burst          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1984\nAuthor  : Joyce Hakansson\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Uncommon\nComments: This is a game more aimed at the younger player now. It plays in the style of Missile Command, funny flying things are swooping down to steal soap bubbles and you must direct shots with a cursor to capture them. An interesting little program.\nCoccinelle          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Computer Access Corporation/Ediciel\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Scarce\nComments: A French regionalised version of \"Delta Drawing\". The title literally translates as \"ladybird\".\nCosmic Life          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Ken Madell\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Uncommon\nComments: Looks rather simple on the outside, but actually is rather a fun, yet unchallenging game that everyone could play. Based on the rules of \"Life\", you must get your colony of cells to grow more than your opponent within the time allowed. You can play fair, or play dirty, it is up to you!\nDelta Drawing          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Computer Access Corporation\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Uncommon\nComments: A very detailed, highly adaptive and comprehensive drawing package for kids. Despite its nature, it is very easy to learn all the commands and can produce some quite neat pictures. Works very much like Logo, only better, with the ability to colour in and paint the canvas also.\nFacemaker          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Designware\nRating  : 3\nRarity  : Common\nComments: A cartridge designed to let children build and animate faces on screen with a variety of different parts. Graphics and sound are pretty basic to say the least, and I can't see this would have kept a child occupied for much length of time, let along myself!\nFraction Fever          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Tom Snyder\nRating  : 4\nRarity  : Common\nComments: Control your pogostick over the fraction plains, punching out incorrect fractions and going up to higher levels by hitting the correct fraction displayed above. Very simple graphics and sound hide a midly entertaining arcade challenge.\nJukebox          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Joyce Hakansson\nRating  : 7\nRarity  : Common\nComments: This is an interesting little dance game where you must control the feet to move over the flashing disco light squares. However you must avoid stepping on the same square too many times otherwise it is game over. More of a puzzle game aimed towards children, this is a good game in its own right for adults.\nKids on Keys          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Frieda Lekkerkerker\nRating  : 5\nRarity  : Common\nComments: Another typing game this time from Spinnaker. No flashy graphics like \"Wizard of Id\" however. Different games provide different challenges trying to get your fingers round the keyboard.\nKindercomp          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Doug Davis\nRating  : 3\nRarity  : Common\nComments: Some basic learning tools for children to, well learn from I guess. Hardly any notable graphics to speak of, mainly being words and simple sprites on screen. Slightly more entertaining than other Spinnaker products perhaps, but this is designed for very young children only.\nRanch          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1984\nAuthor  : Joyce Hakansson\nRating  : 5\nRarity  : Uncommon\nComments: Does exactly what it says on the box. Allows you to build your own ranch, animate it, act out stories and the such like, all to a somewhat authentic Western style music track. Hard work to achieve visible results, but worth it in the end perhaps.\nStory Machine          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Designware\nRating  : 4\nRarity  : Common\nComments: A simple story program to let children use a small part of their imagination and watch the computer act out their commands. Basic graphics and sound, but colourful enough to keep them watching. And you even try eating the cat (pussy?!) if you so desire...\nUp for Grabs          \nCompany : Spinnaker\nYear    : 1983\nAuthor  : Ken Madell\nRating  : 6\nRarity  : Common\nComments: Although aimed at children, this could appeal to family members of all ages seeing as it can be 4 players at once. Plays much like Scrabble, grab the letters off the spinning cubes and use them to form words om a grid. After 4 quarters of competing and manipulation, you add up the scores. Not a bad little game in all.\nBACK"],

A large metal cage should be used with an exercise wheel, tubes for tunnelling and clean shavings for bedding. The bedding should be changed every day to stop any smells forming. They also love to chew so wooden blocks are also a good idea to keep in the cage.\nA drinking bottle should be provided, with the water changed every day, it is also best check that the ball in the water bottle works often to stop your hamster getting dehydrated.\nHamsters like a good diet, with seed bells and blends of grains. They may also like fresh vegetables and fruits.\nVets in Hull East Yorkshire\nKingston Veterinary Group\nClinic & Veterinary Hospital\n1-2 Park Street Anlaby Road Hull East Yorkshire HU3 2JF Tel:01482 223688\nView our Facebook page | Terms & conditions\nCopyright ©2013 Kingston Vets® All rights reserved.\nCompany registered in England No.6002598 | VAT Registration No. 167713936\nWebsite by Design Workshop"],
